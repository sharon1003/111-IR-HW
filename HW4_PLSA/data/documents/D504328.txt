january 17 2014  diy projects3 diy ways to reuse business cards you guys may remember that last year i was a fiesta agent well they sent each of us business cards that we could give out except that i don’t think i ever gave out a single card that left me with 1000 cards that i had nothing to do with so i decided to try to recycle them into a few fun diy projects keep reading to watch the video and check out more photos of all three projects the first thing i made was confetti using fringe scissors my hand did hurt after a while but it was kind of therapeutic getting to shred these cards by hand i decided not to toss all the confetti in the air since that would be a bigger cleanup job than i’m willing to do for one shot of a video so instead i put it in a decorative jar and used it as a vase for colorful fake flowers this craft works the best if your business cards are already colorful which the fiesta cards are and you could also do it with a normal pair of scissors though it may take a bit longer the second thing i made is these cute hanging flowers they’re held together with nothing more than normal scotch tape but i covered them with shiny adhesive laminate which i was pleasantly surprised to find is completely opaque i got the adhesive laminate from my mom for christmas and it came on a big roll so i still have plenty to work with on future projects it’s a bit hard to photograph since it’s so shiny but it just reminds me of something i would have loved in middle school and still do kind of love at the last minute i decided to glue rhinestones in the center which i thing really brings the whole thing together if you don’t want to hang yours you could also glue a magnet to one side and put it in your locker or on the fridge i’m sorry these photos are kind of taken from weird angles but i wanted to hang them in front of my window without showing you exactly what street i live on in the background but i think you can get the ideathe final thing i made is this miniature banner that says “make things” i think this is my favorite project out of the three even though it easily took to the most time to finish originally i wanted to use white duct tape since washi tape usually looks nicer on a light background but the white tape was a bit too translucent and i didn’t want to be able to see the writing on the card through it but i actually really like how the teal duct tape looks and i’m glad i was brave enough to make that color choice i’d love to know if you decide to make things out of old business cards that you have because i still have a ton left over and i need more project ideas if you want to make any of these projects though i linked to all of the speciality materials you’ll need over on my new subblime list i’m also giving away a paper hexagon punch over there so be sure to enter this week if you want a chance to win thank you guys for reading and be sure to check out my entire diycrafting playlist for even more fun projectsyou may also enjoy roommate does my christmas diy voiceover5 ways to make your craft supplies cute diy holographic chalkboard diy gradient jigsaw puzzle sharebanner business cards confetti diy upcycling
