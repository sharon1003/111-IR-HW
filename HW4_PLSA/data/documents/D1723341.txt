pets horses how much does a vet farrier cost for a horse how much would an estimate be for a regular check up for a horse and also for the farrier follow 8 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer i like these questions it depends on the horse and what farrier and vet you use not including the call fee if your horse has no shoes and just needs a trim it should be about 50 if your horse needs only regular front shoes it should be about 70 if your horse needs front and back shoes it should be about 100 if your horse has feet problems and needs corrective shoes be prepared to pay anywhere from 100 to 250 and on to the vet a regular checkup is usually about 50 not including the call fee but if something is found that needs to be corrected it could be very costly also shots and stuff will be about 200 for spring then about 20 per every 3 months for deworming you can buy this at the feed store the problem with horses is that they manage to hurt themselves andor throw a shoe just when you cant afford it or go lame when its really not convenient not that it ever is but they pick the worse times it is really important to have health insurance on your horse of something major happens they can help with the cost make sure you get some the covers colic surgery source skatherine n · 9 years ago5 1 comment askers rating depends on what the horse needs a regular vet checkup runs 75200 ballpark could be higher or lower no shots and thats with a farm call for the farrier you could be paying as little as 35 if your horse is barefoot and has good feet and there really is no upper limit to what people will pay for a good farrier show horses can sometimes run hundreds per trim personally i pay 50 for a trim and 75 for new shoes when my horse needed corrective shoeing it was 125 a trim julie is gone · 9 years ago1 0 comment the answer to both questions depends on two things your location your horse farrier costs especially are highly variable depending on where you keep your horse example in southern california if you keep your horse in one of the highrent districts like palos verdes some of the malibu areas or brentwood youll pay around 110 for a straightforward trim and four prefab shoes cold shoeing nothing special if you go out to chino norco corona or riverside youll pay a little more than half that for the same job so to know how much a farrier will cost you have to ask the farriers in the area where you want to keep the horse get out your yellow pages look under farrier and make a few phone calls most farriers will be happy to give you a ballpark figure vet costs are less variable by area although there is still some variation again with the highrent areas costing more than the lowrent areas because the vets overhead costs are higher as a general rule for a horse in reasonable health with no special problems 500year should more than cover all normal vet costs like worming vaccinations and dentistry most of the time it will be about 250300year but sometimes the dentistry can cost more than average especially if your horse has to be tranquilized so the vet can work on him things nonemergency that can raise your vet costs if your horse has arthritis youll be spending more on medications to keep him comfortable if your horse gets an abscess in his foot youll have a vet cost of 75150 if your horse gets a reaction to a vaccination and gets a stiff neck or sore spot youll pay for meds for that every time you have vaccinations where things get expensive fast are when you get an emergency and horses are the most accidentprone animals on the face of the earth the recommendation i make is that you have a 5000 emergency reserve fund for each horse you have this does not mean you have to have 5000 in cash available or have 5000 in savings most people i know of do something like keep a credit card with a 5000 limit on it available for horse emergencies or they have a line of credit on their home equity that they can draw on or a family member who can come up with the cash the point is when its 300 am on a sunday night and your horse has an intestinal blockage and the vet wants to take him to a clinic to have surgery that is going to cost several thousand dollars you need to be able to tell the vet youre good for the money some vets will work out payments if youve been a patient for a long long time and youve never been late paying your account but most wont and if they dont know you they need to know youll guarantee the payment before they proceed some people go for their horses entire life and never have an emergency some get hit several times in 30 years of keeping horses ive had to come up with that kind of money for treatment twice once when my horse got pneumonia and again when he was in his twenties and had two emergencies in succession karin c · 9 years ago0 0 comment hi im in the uk and for a vet call out its £25 then whatever you have done on top with regards farrier

ask for referrals from other ranches and people who own horses they can usually stear you in the right directionbullybreeder · 9 years ago1 0 commentokay first off it depends on the horses needs and also how much your vet and farrier charge my vet charges me a 40 farm call and 45 for a exam and i only pay 30 for a farrier but thats because he is bare if you need shoes it will run anywhere from 60100 and thats if your horse just needs a basic trim and shoe and nothin special nesha · 9 years ago1 0 comment well both of these things depend on where you live prices range a lot depending on your location  i pay around 200 per vet check depending on what theyre doing remember to save around 1000 extra for emergency vet bills  i pay around 150 for shoes every 68 weeks not all horses have to have shoes though it supports them better though and i highly recommend it hope i helped say what · 9 years ago0 0 commentthe vet  well it partly depends where u live where i am prices are high fl it is 35 just to get the vet out then it goes up from there for what u get what u need blah blah blah farrier i know people who pay about 750 every 4 weeks then i only pay 250 that is 4 shoes nothing
