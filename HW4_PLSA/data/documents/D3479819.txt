production  editdevelopment  editthe 1998 fantasy novel stardust by neil gaiman was first optioned for a film adaptation by miramax in 1998–99 according to gaiman the film went through an unsatisfactory development period and he recovered the rights after they expired 5 6eventually discussions about a film version of stardust began taking place between gaiman director terry gilliam and matthew vaughn after gilliam dropped out following his involvement with the brothers grimm vaughn left the talks to direct layer cake gaiman and vaughn resumed talks after the director walked away from helming the film xmen the last stand and in january 2005 vaughn acquired the option to develop the film adaptation 7 in october 2005 the director entered final negotiations with paramount pictures to direct and produce stardust with a budget estimated at us 70 million 8adaptation  editthe adapted screenplay was written by vaughn and screenwriter jane goldman when asked how the book inspired his vision for the film vaughn said that he wanted to do princess bride with a midnight run overtone 9 one of the difficulties with adapting the novel was its earnest and dark nature an adult fairy tale in which sex and violence are presented unflinchingly as a result of changes the movie version has a greater element of whimsy and humour with gaimans blessing given to the screenwriters gaiman did not want people to go to the theatre to see a film that attempted to be completely loyal to stardust the book and failed 10 after creating the audiobook version of the novel gaiman realised that there were 10½ hours of material in the book this led him to acknowledge that the film would have to compress the novel leaving out portions of the work budgetary concerns also factored into the adaptation even with the level of 2006 technology 5vaughn and goldman decided that the witches needed names as in the book they were collectively the lilim and their names were lost beneath the sea their classical decisions included names also found in the books of magic empusa and neverwhere lamia 11on the films differences from the novel gaiman commented i sort of feel like my grounding in comics was actually very useful because in my head thats just the earthtwo version of stardust its a parallel earth version of stardust which has robert de niro and stuff and i get people who come to the book from having loved the movie who are really disappointed at some of the stuff that isnt there that matthew brought 12casting  editin march 2006 the studio cast robert de niro michelle pfeiffer claire danes charlie cox and sienna miller production began in the united kingdom and iceland in april 2006 with the majority of filming taking place in the uk 13 vaughn himself picked danes cox and pfeiffer for their roles he intended captain shakespeare to be played by either de niro or jack nicholson stephen fry was pitched as a possible shakespeare but vaughn eventually picked de niro 14cox was tentatively cast as tristan but to ensure the leads had chemistry on screen vaughn would not confirm the casting until both leads were cast vaughn had cox audition alongside the prospective leading actresses until the female lead was cast 15the role of quintus was originally given to comedian noel fielding but due to health issues he had to drop out and was replaced by fellow comedian
