understanding dog behavior ever ask yourself what was my dog thinking sometimes dogs do things that seem really strange but once you get a better understanding of dog behavior you wont have to wonder so much things dogs say hopefully this information will help you and your puppy andor dog s have a better understanding of who is communicating what to whom and why to a puppy and dog we are strange beings whose ways just dont all make perfect sense thats a hard position to be in because your dogs world is controlled by you a dog cant explain to you what youre failing to understand about him while we live in a world of language dogs communicate in a variety of other ways we have all seen read or experienced most or all of the things discussed below however as a reminder here they are for your review its important that you learn to understand your puppy and understand what hes saying to you the better you understand how he experiences his world the less likely youll become frustrated or angry and perhaps treat your charge unkindly ultimately the better and stronger the bond between you and your dog will be here are some quick steps to help you communicate better with your puppy andor dogs1 your dog moves away when you pet his head how are you doing the petting a lot of people are taught that the way to pet a dog is to keep patting the top of his head but a dog perceives that action as a signal of dominance not affection it also just doesnt feel good dogs prefer to be stroked particularly on the side of the face under the chin or on the front of the chest they also like having their rumps scratched2 your dog circles the mat before going to sleep this is an ethologic vestige its in the dna dogs in the wild flattened the grass by circling around it a few times before settling down they were creating a safe and comfortable nest today dogs are acting out a primordial sequence that was genetically encoded many thousands of years ago and passed down from generation to generation3 your dog barks at the mailman no matter how well acquainted the two are your pup probably thinks hes exerting some power by getting the mail carrier to leave he does leave soon after the dog starts barking doesnt he4 your dog grunts a grunt from a puppy is a communication of pleasure soughtafter warmth or communion has been attained5 your dog whines a puppy whines if he is cold hungry or separated from those he feels he needs to be near for comfort and safety put a warm towel over him feed him or give him some attention and the whining will probably stop6 dog blinks thats what a dog does when he is thinking hard if you down to get him to like down and he blinks before doing so he is thinking do i have to7 yawns a dog may yawn if hes tired but more generally its an indicator of stress with yawning the dog is trying to displace the stress or inner conflict with a safe neutral behavior humans do the same thing when they find themselves in a situation of conflict and causes stress  not yawn necessarily but do some things to cope until the unpleasant situation passes lets say youre in a hurry and you reach a red light you want to be there but you have to be here both because thats the safe thing to do and because someone else the police will enforce the behavior and causes the stress staying still until the light turns green so what do you do you groom yourself in the rear view mirror or you look at the driver in the car next to you neither of these actions is directly related to whats pressing on your mind but engaging in them is better than doing nothing while youre stuck in the state of conflict between what you want to do and what you must do despite your desires thats pretty much the same thing your dogs yawning whens not tired8 licks his lips this is a sign of nervousness anxiety and submission people do it too9 licks you this is not really a kiss rather its a deferent attentionseeking gesture similar to what a pup is expressing when he licks his mothers lips to get her to regurgitate food why then do dogs often lick people in moments of affection most likely its because they get good feedback for it however some dogs lick to establish dominance10 keeps climbing up onto the couch even when youve told him no a puppy who tries to get as high or higher up than you might be vying for dominance but puppies also prefer soft to hard surfaces sometimes a cushion is just a cushion11 paws and scrapes the ground after eliminating a dog that scratches the ground after eliminating is actually engaging in a kind of marking behavior to advertise his presence  the opposite of trying to cover up the evidence by pawing the dirt he is leaving both a visual cue unearthed soil and an olfactory one coming from we can only assume sweat glands on his paws12 eats feces called coprophagia this behavior is commonly displayed by puppies it is speciestypical behavior bitches keep the whelping area clean after they give birth by eating their youngs feces there is nothing harmful about it to a pup who will probably outgrow the behavior by the time hes one year old but if you find it too objectionable simply deny access always walk the pup on a leash and pick up after dogs and other species of animals who have relieved themselves in your yard some say that adding meat tenderizers or breath fresheners to the dogs diet helps curb the habit but it does not work13 rolls around in disgusting stuff including muddy messes feces and carcasses remember dogs see largely through their sense of smell when they roll around in something and stink to high heaven theyre not trying to be disgusting theyre saying look what i found what a day i had in the cow pasture it could also be a holdover from the times when dogs ran wild rolling in the excrement of another animal or rotting material masks the dogs own odor thereby making him less easily detectable by potential predators or prey that he is staking out14 eats grass some people believe dogs eat grass to make themselves throw up when they have stomach upset that is the dogs are thought to selfmedicate some believe dogs simply like to eat grass and then throw up when they eat too much of it whos right both different dogs have different grass eating patterns none of them are harmful so dont fret if your dog throws up after nibbling on grass15 sniffs around forever before urinating to a human urination is urination to a dog its an elimination process and a way of communicating so a dog has to take in the various olfactory notices left by other dogs before leaving a message of his own he may even want to make sure that no other pup has previously urinated in the spot hes considering an all clear sign takes some time be patient16 sniffs another dogs behinds if smelling were seeing humans would be considered legally blind by those in the canine world dogs would feel mores the pity for us for not getting anything out of sniffing the behinds of others pheromones generated from the glands around a dogs anus let another dog know the identity of another dog theyre as crucial to learning about another dog as the pheromones contained in vaginal secretions and urine17 pants unlike humans dogs dont have sweat glands on most of their skin there are only a few on their paws and around the anus thus they dont have the mechanism we do for cooling their bodies by losing body heat through the evaporation of sweat rather the way they regulate body temperature when it starts to rise is by panting the faster a dog pants the more watersaturated air he is breathing out evaporating from his lungs and that has a cooling effect that said dogs dont pant only when theyre hot sometimes they pant when theyre anxious or in pain18 acts happier around dogs of his own breed it is believed that dogs do not have a sense of selfimage and do not even necessarily recognize themselves in a mirror it may simply be that your pup had a good experience with his siblings so he seeks out others who look like them it can work the other way too if say your pet a border collie who has had unfortunate experiences with cocker spaniels he may spend his whole life acting aggressive or fearful about that breed19 nurses on things like blankets or stuffed animals if a puppy lives with his mother until he is at least six to eight weeks of age he will probably not suck on various nonliving items thats because he will have had the opportunity to nurse to his hearts content as a newborn its those puppies whose biological drive to nurse from their mothers has been denied that end up nursing on things they shouldnt be nursing on some puppy breeds have a greater propensity to nurse on blankets and such and even on themselves than other breeds when denied access to their mothers such as doberman pinschers and dachshunds20 runs in his sleep with that slight paddling of limbs some dogs experience while sleeping it is believed they are dreaming about precisely what you might think theyre dreaming about  chasing a squirrel or some other creature your pup could even be revising some great memory of the previous day during which he ran a rodent up a tree
