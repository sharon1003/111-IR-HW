in the early 1990s one thing was fairly certain about the expansion of the universe it might have enough energy density to stop its expansion and recollapse it might have so little energy density that it would never stop expanding but gravity was certain to slow the expansion as time went on granted the slowing had not been observed but theoretically the universe had to slow the universe is full of matter and the attractive force of gravity pulls all matter together then came 1998 and the hubble space telescope hst observations of very distant supernovae that showed that a long time ago the universe was actually expanding more slowly than it is today so the expansion of the universe has not been slowing due to gravity as everyone thought it has been accelerating no one expected this no one knew how to explain it but something was causing it eventually theorists came up with three sorts of explanations maybe it was a result of a longdiscarded version of einsteins theory of gravity one that contained what was called a cosmological constant maybe there was some strange kind of energyfluid that filled space maybe there is something wrong with einsteins theory of gravity and a new theory could include some kind of field that creates this cosmic acceleration theorists still dont know what the correct explanation is but they have given the solution a name it is called dark energy what is dark energy more is unknown than is known we know how much dark energy there is because we know how it affects the universes expansion other than that it is a complete mystery but it is an important mystery it turns out that roughly 68 of the universe is dark energy dark matter makes up about 27 the rest  everything on earth everything ever observed with all of our instruments all normal matter  adds up to less than 5 of the universe come to think of it maybe it shouldnt be called normal matter at all since it is such a small fraction of the universe universe dark energy1 expanding universe this diagram reveals changes in the rate of expansion since the universes birth 15 billion years ago the more shallow the curve the faster the rate of expansion the curve changes noticeably about 75 billion years ago when objects in the universe began flying apart as a faster rate astronomers theorize that the faster expansion rate is due to a mysterious dark force that is pulling galaxies apart credit nasastsciann feild one explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space albert einstein was the first person to realize that empty space is not nothing space has amazing properties many of which are just beginning to be understood the first property that einstein discovered is that it is possible for more space to come into existence then one version of einsteins gravity theory the version that contains a cosmological constant makes a second prediction empty space can possess its own energy because this energy is a property of space itself it would not be diluted as space expands as more space comes into existence more of this energyofspace would appear as a result this form of energy would cause the universe to expand faster and faster unfortunately no one understands why the cosmological constant should even be there much less why it would have exactly the right value to cause the observed acceleration of the universe dark matter core defies explanation this image shows the distribution of dark matter galaxies and hot gas in the core of the merging galaxy cluster abell 520 the result could present a challenge to basic theories of dark matter another explanation for how space acquires energy comes from the quantum theory of matter in this theory empty space is actually full of temporary virtual particles that continually form and then disappear but when physicists tried to calculate how much energy this would give empty space the answer came out wrong  wrong by a lot the number came out 10 120 times too big thats a 1 with 120 zeros after it its hard to get an answer that bad so the mystery continues another explanation for dark energy is that it is a new kind of dynamical energy fluid or field something that fills all of space but something whose effect on the expansion of the universe is the opposite of that of matter and normal energy some theorists have named this quintessence after the fifth element of the greek philosophers but if quintessence is the answer we still dont know what it is like what it interacts with or why it exists so the mystery continues a last possibility is that einsteins theory of gravity is not correct that would not only affect the expansion of the universe but it would also affect the way that normal matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies behaved this fact would provide a way to decide if the solution to the dark energy problem is a new gravity theory or not we could observe how galaxies come together in clusters but if it does turn out that a new theory of gravity is needed what kind of theory would it be how could it correctly describe the motion of the bodies in the solar system as einsteins theory is known to do and still give us the different prediction for the universe that we need there are candidate theories but none are compelling so the mystery continues the thing that is needed to decide between dark energy possibilities  a property of space a new dynamic fluid or a new theory of gravity  is more data better data what is dark matter by fitting a theoretical model of the composition of the universe to the combined set of cosmological observations scientists have come up with the composition that we described above 68 dark energy 27 dark matter 5 normal matter what is dark matter we are much more certain what dark matter is not than we are what it is first it is dark meaning that it is not in the form of stars and planets that we see observations show that there is far too little visible matter in the universe to make up the 27 required by the observations second it is not in the form of dark clouds of normal matter matter made up of particles called baryons we know this because we would be able to detect baryonic clouds by their absorption of radiation passing through them third dark matter is not antimatter because we do not see the unique gamma rays that are produced when antimatter annihilates with matter finally we can rule out large galaxysized black holes on the basis of how many gravitational lenses we see high concentrations of matter bend light passing near them from objects further away but we do not see enough lensing events to suggest that such objects to make up the required 25 dark matter contribution abell 2744 pandoras cluster revealed one of the most complicated and dramatic collisions between galaxy clusters ever seen is captured in this new composite image of abell 2744 the blue shows a map of the total mass concentration mostly dark matter however at this point there are still a few dark matter possibilities that are viable baryonic matter could still make up the dark matter if it were all tied up in brown dwarfs or in small dense chunks of heavy elements these possibilities are known as massive compact halo objects or  machos  but the most common view is that dark matter is not baryonic at all but that it is made up of other more exotic particles like axions or wimps
