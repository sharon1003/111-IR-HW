what’s a general ledger and why do i need one by quick books5 min read back in prehistory before small convenient and inexpensive computers we did all our accounting by hand we used hardcover binders with pegs over which the ledger sheets were placed we eventually graduated to cheaper threering binders then to computers with quick books one of the earliest affordable consumer accounting software packages available to small business owners but with all this new technology are general ledgers still relevant you betthe basics of a general ledger when we did our record keeping by hand we had separate journals from the word “jour” meaning “day” for each task these are the three main journals accounts receivable the daily record of the company’s sales and receipts and the invoices that clients had not yet paid accounts payable the daily record of the company’s purchases and invoices the company still had to pay payroll the record of each employee’s compensation the checks written to pay the employees and the related payroll taxes summaries of the monthly activities would be entered into the general ledger—”the books”—a master record for the company’s activities we made journal entries using a doubleentry system if you entered everything correctly the company’s books would balance in other words when you added up the balances in each account the total would be zero this was all quite elegant and satisfying when we balanced but balancing didn’t always happen we would often spend hours searching for the error that unbalanced our books the old general ledgers didn’t have much detail in the income and expense accounts though we maintained excruciating detail in the balance sheet accounts in those accounts we set up a separate page for each vehicle or asset purchased showing the depreciation for each asset on its own adjacent page there was a page for each payable and loan there was a lot of duplicate entries between the journals and the general ledger if you need

the software evolved fairly quickly and today we no longer have to duplicate our entries when we set up the chart of accounts properly we only have to enter each transaction once and it appears in all the appropriate journals now generally called “reports” as well as in the detailed general ledger this detailed report means you can see every single transaction that went into every account with a view of all entries it’s easy to spot payments or deposits that don’t belong in a particular account this helps your tax professional clean up your books before preparing your tax return for example when looking at automobile expenses you can see each check or creditcard charge that you entered—for gasoline car washes repairs car payments etc this is a very common mistake the car payments don’t belong in automobile expenses because those are loan payments part of the payment belongs on the balance sheet where it reduces the loan balance and part of that payment goes to the interest expense on the car loan another common error is when the officer or owner deposits money into the company bank account to cover expenses sometimes these accidentally get posted to an income account by being able to see this kind of detail we can either correct the original entry and put it into the correct account loan from ownershareholder or make a journal entry to preserve the “audit trail” that means your books show all the changes made by you your staff or your tax professional to get the most out of your general ledger and all other reports set up the company’s structure properly hire someone
