such as czechs poles ukrainians jews italians and african americans that began to settle in chicago in the early 1900s were mostly detached from the political system due in part to lack of organization which led to underrepresentation in the city council as an immigrant himself cermak recognized chicagos relatively new immigrants as a significant population of disenfranchised voters and a large power base for cermak and his local democratic organization  citation needed before cermak the democratic party in cook county was run by irish americans as cermak climbed the local political

name like that cermak replied he doesnt like my name its true i didnt come over on the mayflower but i came over as soon as i could it was a sentiment to which ethnic chicagoans could relate and thompsons slur largely backfired 4 the flamboyant thompsons reputation as a buffoon the voters disgust with the corruption of his machine and his inability or unwillingness to clean up organized crime in chicago were cited as major factors in cermak capturing 58 of the vote in the mayoral election on april 6 1931 cermaks victory finished thompson as a political power and largely ended the republican partys power in chicago indeed all the mayors of chicago since 1931 have been members of the democratic party for nearly his entire administration cermak had to deal with a major tax revolt from 1931 to 1933 the association of real estate taxpayers mounted a tax strike at its height aret which was headed by john m pratt and james e bistor had over thirty thousand members much to cermaks dismay it successfully slowed down the collection of real estate taxes through litigation and promoting refusal to pay in the meantime the city found it difficult to pay teachers and maintain services cermak was obliged to meet presidentelect franklin d roosevelt to mend fences and get money to fund essential city services death  editanton cermaks tomb at bohemian national cemetery in chicago while shaking hands with presidentelect franklin d roosevelt at bayfront park in miami florida on february 15 1933 cermak was shot 5 in the lung and mortally wounded when giuseppe zangara who at the time was believed to have been engaged in an attempt to assassinate roosevelt hit cermak instead at the critical moment lilian cross a woman standing near zangara hit zangaras arm with her purse and spoiled his aim 6 in addition to cermak zangara hit four other people one of whom mabel gill also died of her injuries 6 zangara told the police that he hated rich and powerful people but not roosevelt personally 7 once at the hospital cermak reportedly uttered the line that is engraved on his tomb speaking to fdr cermak allegedly said im glad it was me instead of you the chicago tribune reported the quote without attributing it to a witness and most scholars doubt it was ever said 8later rumors circulated that cermak not roosevelt had been the intended target as his promise to clean up chicagos rampant lawlessness posed a threat to al capone and the chicago organized crime syndicate 5 9 according to roosevelt biographer jean edward smith there is no proof for this theory 10 one of the first people to suggest the organized crime theory was reporter walter winchell who happened to be in miami the evening of the shooting 11 12 longtime chicago newsman len oconnor offers a different view of the events surrounding the mayors assassination he has written that aldermen paddy bauler and charlie weber informed him that relations between cermak and fdr were strained because cermak fought fdrs nomination at the democratic convention in chicago 13 author ronald humble offers another view as to why cermak was killed in his book frank nitti the true story of chicagos notorious enforcer humble contends that cermak was as corrupt as thompson and that the chicago outfit hired zangara to kill cermak in retaliation for cermaks attempt to murder frank nitti monument to anton cermak in the town in which he was born cermak died at jackson memorial hospital in miami 14 on march 6 partly because of his wounds on march 30 however his personal physician dr karl a meyer
