probably girlfriend cause it says ditching me but could be parents etc is choking and for now he just needs to get a lot of freedom when hes ready to have a tight relationship again hell come around and let himself been found so in the song he ask people not to be angry or say but to just let him go his own way and trust him eventually everything will turn out fine maple leaf on november 02 2004

control it seems like theyre fighting over his drug use im a loser and a user so i dont need no accuser to try and slag me down because i know youre right and that hes thinking that maybe its not worth the effort like its impossible for them to ever be together forever regos the sane on september 29 2004 link no replies log in to reply1 general comment this song makes me happy mr way on june 11 2007 link no replies log in to reply1 general comment this song is about when someones pressuring you to do something like maybe getting into a more comitted relationship with them or something like thathow would i know ive never been in love deep down you know its the right thing to do but youre just not ready for it yet so you lash out at whoevers pressuring you telling them to quit feeling sorry for yourself that youre just roamin for the moment and that you cant go forcing something if its just not rightmeaning that they should just drop the idea of being more committed and all that because you dont think its the right thing to do at the moment basically youre torn half of you wants to remain the way you are with the person not very serious but the other half just knows its only a matter of time until youre ready for it the person pressuring you just has to wait for when you come around sandwichmasta on july 11 2007 link no replies log in to reply1 general comment qtywuh the girl is trying to find the perfect guy and he thinks its him but she doesnt notice him like that when she finally realizes it its too late and hes already moved on you cant go forcing something if its just not right pretty much is how he feels about her wanting to hook up make sense with your personal problem blackmyeyes on december 22 2007 link no replies log in to reply1 general comment blackmyeyesi think the song is along those lines too i dont understand the way other people are interpreting it there is a huge amount of apathy in the lyrics heres my reasoning i heard you crying loud all the way across town she got hurt by some other guy youve been searching for that someone and its me out on the prowl and is looking for him for comfort and attention once again this is probably a repeat pattern for them as you sit around feeling sorry for yourself well dont get lonely now and dry your whining eyes im just roaming for the moment sleazin my back yard so dont get so uptight you been thinking about ditching me he is saying that hes right where he was the last time this happened hes laid back about it and he knows that she is just using him to lift her spirits she doesnt realize what she is doing and is confused about what she wants no time to search the world around cause you know where ill be found when i come around i heard it all before so dont knock down my door again this is a repeat pattern im a loser and a user so i dont need no accuser to try and slag me down because i know im right she is letting out her frustration on him shes probably mad that he is so laid back and not babying her hes not interested enough in her isnt giving her enough attention since hes so laid back hes saying whatever youre right so go do what you like make sure you do it wise hes telling her in an apathetic way to go and find the right person this time that wont hurt her you may find out that your self doubt means nothing was ever there since she keeps leaving him for other guys she really doesnt want him if its that easy to leave him then there is nothing meaningful between them you cant go forcing something if its just not right pretty blatant no time to search the world around cause you know where ill be found when i come around 2 times when i come around sev times thats my interpretation i may be biased since ive been through the same thing for the past 10 years although sadly i feel that i may be the girl in this situation untruewords on september 25 2008 link no replies log in to reply1 general comment i really really miss the old green day
