composition of air standard air components and sitespecific additionsair is the name we give to the mixture of gases which make up the earths atmosphere the composition physical and chemical properties of air are very similar everywhere it is useful to think of the air which we encounter every day as being a locallyproduced mixture of three types of ingredients standard dry air which is mainly composed of three gases nitrogen about 78 oxygen about 21 and argon about 1 together these three gases make up 9996 of dry air all three can be economically recovered as industrial gas products standard dry air also contains a small amount of carbon dioxide and very small amounts of neon helium krypton hydrogen and xenon see table below water vapor humidity the amount of water vapor in air at ground level can vary quite a bit  from almost zero to about 5 percent many factors influence the amount of humidity in the air at a given location and time other constituents which are usually

direction time of time of day and season of the year nonstandard components may be present due to natural processes biological or geological or human activities industrial transportation agricultural some common but nonstandard components include methane and sulfur dioxide which can be present in the parts per million range nitrous oxide nitrogen dioxide ammonia and carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide co 2 is considered to be a standard component of air although the average concentration of carbon dioxide in air is currently increasing at the rate of about 25 ppmv per year and the concentration varies somewhat by location and season of the year any standard value for the concentration of carbon dioxide in air is an approximation it is more meaningful to assign a range to the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide than to use a single value at this time 404 ppmv  3 ppmv is a reasonable value view recent historical concentration data future co2 ranges will presumably continue to rise at a rate of about 25 ppmv per year in the near term consequently when designing systems which have long useful lifetimes the ability to handle co2 concentrations which may be present in a decade or two circa 430 ppmv for example should be considered for more information on this and related topics see the extended discussion of co2 levels belowtable 2 physical properties of standard dry air

and contaminants can be found in tables on this website the physical property data is presented in your choice of english or metric units  air temperature affects potential moisture content and moisture content affects air density as air temperature increases so does its ability to hold water vapor the upper limit on water vapor content is predictable for at a given temperature but the actual amount of water vapor which is present in air at a given time and place will be determined by many factors in temperate areas the water vapor content will typically be between 1 to 2 in spring and fall less than onehalf percent in winter and as much as 5 on a hot humid summer day in humid tropical areas the water vapor content can be even higher while in deserts the water vapor content of air with the same dry bulb temperature may be very low in nearpolar regions the water vapor content of air will be less than 01 water vapor is less dense than air the molecular weight of water is 1802 vs2898 for dry air consequently when water vapor is mixed with air the density of the mixture will be less than that of dry air the difference in density between dry air and saturated air increases with temperature because the percentage of water in saturated air increases this difference in density leads to a longrecognized link between fluctuations in barometric pressure and weather conditions high barometric pressure is associated with clear skies while low barometric pressure is associated with cloudy skies and rain this table illustrates the impact of temperature on maximum potential

and other properties of air water vapor is the component of air which can vary the most from place to place from day to day even hour to hour the amount of water vapor in air will literally change with the weather and other variables such as proximity to large bodies of water and the temperature of the water in those nearby lakes seas and oceans both relative and absolute humidity measurements have been developed to quantify the amount of water vapor present in atmospheric air relative humidity is closely linked to human comfort both very dry air and very humid air are less comfortable than air which has a relative humidity of about 50 absolute humidity is most useful for engineering calculations such as sizing equipment to be used for compressing or drying  dehumidifying air th e body of knowledge and techniques which allow physical and thermodynamic properties of air to be calculated for any set of temperature and pressure conditions are known as psychrometry  useful definitions and relationships related to water content and other properties of air are summarized below  and presented in more detail on the psychrometry page drybulb temperature dry bulb temperature is what is usually meant by air temperature it is measured with a normal thermometer dew point dew point is the temperature at which water vapor begins to condense out of the air dew points can be defined and specified for ambient air or for compressed air wetbulb temperature wet bulb temperature is never higher than dry bulb temperature they are equal when air is at its dew point or saturation temperature the difference between the dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures is an indicator of the humidity level wetbulb temperature is the lowest temperature that water will reach by evaporative cooling and that temperature is almost always lower than dry bulb wet bulb temperature is a critical parameter for sizing and measuring the performance of evaporativecooled cooling water systems relative humidity relative humidity at dew point conditions is 100 otherwise relative humidity is the percentage of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the maximum amount that the air could hold under those temperature and pressure conditions this measurement is highly correlated with human comfort  with about 50 being most comfortable  absolute humidity with the aid of a psychrometric chart or its computerized equivalent absolute values for water content such as weight fraction of ambient air or weightperunitvolume of ambient air can be determined for any combination of dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures or combination of dry bulb temperature and relative humidity this measurement is required to design various types of moisture removal or humidification systems psychrometric charts

extends to a height of about 6 kilometers 4 miles at the poles and to 11 kilometers 36000 feet or 7 miles near the equator the troposphere has similar composition at all levels but its average pressure temperature and density decrease with altitude in the lowest levels of the atmosphere air temperature decreases as elevation increases  on average about 356˚f for every 1000 feet or 65˚c for each 1000 meters of elevation atmospheric pressure drops as elevation increases  about 05 psia for each 1000 feet of elevation or about 11 k pa for each 100 meters air density decreases rapidly with

oxygen nitrogen and argon  atmospheric industrial gas products critical to modern life nitrogen oxygen and argon the three primary constituents of air can be recovered from air in air separation plants each of these atmospheric industrial gases is valued for particular properties each of these gases are used extensively in industry the medical field and in some products used in homes oxygen is valued for reactivity  it supports biological processes and combustion in many industries it is used in steelmaking and other metals refining and fabrication processes as well as in chemicals pharmaceuticals petroleum processing glass and ceramic manufacture pulp and paper manufacture healthcare environmental protection through treatment of municipal sewage and industrial effluents and in other miscellaneous uses oxygen is often used with or instead of air to maximize the amount of oxygen available for combustion or biological activity it is used to assist breathing in hospitals and other places in industry oxygen is used to increase reaction rates in industrial equipment and processes to allow greater throughput in existing equipment and smaller sizes for new equipment in some cases such as industrial and municipal effluent treatment normal oxygen o2 is first converted to ozone o3 which is a more reactive form of oxygen using ozone instead of normal oxygen enhances reaction rates and ensures complete elimination of undesired compounds gaseous nitrogen is valued for inertness in many industrial applications i t is used to shield potentially reactive materials from contact with oxygen it helps maintain quality and ensure safety in numerous applications it is not a truly inert material as it will oxidize at very high temperatures and is routinely consumed in some biological processes liquid nitrogen is valued for coldness plus inertness vaporizing liquid nitrogen and warming the gas to ambient temperature absorbs a large quantity of heat liquid nitrogen combining inertness with intense cold is an an ideal coolant for certain specialized applications  one of these is food freezing where very rapid freezing results in minimal cell damage from ice crystals leading to improved appearance taste and texture when thawed liquid nitrogen is also used to facilitate machining or fracturing of soft or heat sensitive materials  these include plastics certain metals pharmaceuticals and even sophisticated processes which shred used tires  turning a difficult to handle waste product into materials which can be recycled into other useful products argon is valued for its total inertness it is used in critical industrial processes such as producing high quality stainless steels and growing impurityfree silicon crystals for semiconductor manufacture it is used as a shield gas in critical welding applications as a filler gas for light bulbs and as a heavierthanair filler gas for the space between glass panels in highefficiency multipane windows  neon krypton and xenon   rare gases from the atmosphere  special gases for special uses the socalled rare gases neon krypton and xenon are present in very low concentrations in air which makes them economically recoverable only in large air separation plants all of these gases are monatomic  they are valued for chemical inertness and for their light emitting properties when electrically charged the boiling point of neon is significantly lower than nitrogen lower than all the gases except helium and hydrogen it can be used as a very low temperature working fluid in refrigeration cycles krypton and xenon have additional uses that take advantage of their inertness and high molecular weight 8380 and 13130 respectively krypton and xenon are about two to three times as heavy as argon molecular weight 3995 and approximately three to four times as heavy as nitrogen not a true inert gas at 280 krypton and xenon are used in very high insulating value multipane windows as they minimize heat loss due to convection between the panes these gases are also used in light bulbs where their presence as a filler gas slows evaporation of the hot tungsten filament leading to longer useful operating life andor the ability to use higher efficiency thinner filaments while still retaining acceptable operating life more information on atmospheric gas properties

material safety data sheets seasonal atmospheric changes affect air separation plant performance many aspects of air separation design and operation are determined by the properties of air air separation plants are designed to handle expected concentrations of nonstandard air components safely and in a manner which ensures the purity of protects when the local atmosphere is known to contain or potentially contain unusually high concentrations of gases such as sulfur oxides co2 hydrogen ammonia methane or higher hydrocarbons additional purification impurity removal processes are added to the air compression and air separation systems average atmospheric pressure at a plant site which is primarily a function of elevation must be known to properly select air compression machinery  air compressors are typically equipped with inlet guide vanes or other means of capacity control but still have a limited range of operation the maximum volume of inlet air that can be processed in a compressor as measured in actual cubic feet or cubic meters per minute is similar at any inlet pressure to deliver the same amount of air measured in pounds tons kilograms standard cubic feet normal cubic meters etc when operating at high elevations a compressor must process greater physical volumes of inlet air than would be required if the compressor were being operated near sea level about 34 more for each 1000 feet or 11 more for each 100 meters to achieve the same discharge pressure when the inlet pressure is lower than it would be at sea level the pressure ratio across the compressor must be higher which requires more power weatherrelated variations in atmospheric pressure have only minor impacts on the performance of installed air separation systems however seasonal and daily variations in air temperature and humidity can have significant impacts on plant operations temperature impact on compression capacity cold dry winter air can be 10 denser than dry summer air since air compression equipment has limited ability to adjust the volume of inlet air that will be compressed lower density summer air decreases the air handling and production capacities of air separation systems while higher density cooler winter air results in greater air compression capacity as measured in standard cubic feet standard cubic meters or by weight humidity impact on dry air delivery the effective dry air compression capacity of air separation plants is reduced on humid days water vapor entering an air separation system must be removed to meet product specifications and to avoid operating problems this removal occurs automatically in interstage coolers in which the condensed water is drained off since humidity can represent as much as 5 of the volume of ambient air on a hot humid summer day the ability to deliver dry air to the downstream air separation equipment can be reduced by as much as 5 on such days density impact on discharge pressure the pressure that is developed across a centrifugal compressor is a function of the density of the gas being compressed lessdense hot and humid air results in less pressure increase conversely higher discharge pressures are available when compressing cool dry winter air because of these atmospheric effects the effective production capacity of air separation equipment can be measurably reduced on hot humid days compared to winter and yearlyaverage conditions to assure satisfactory operation the effects of ambient air temperature and moisture content must be taken into account when sizing new equipment relocating used equipment and comparing plant operating data taken at different times  carbon dioxide content in air  current level  historical levels  rate of change the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere shown in the table above 404 ppmv is representative of the current annual average level 2016 this is an historically high value for the concentration of co 2 in the earths atmosphere it is quite possible that the concentration of carbon dioxide in air has not been this high for many hundreds of thousands if not millions of years conventionally carbon dioxide is considered to be a component of standard air however unlike other components of standard air such as nitrogen oxygen and argon which show very little variation from place to place or over time the concentration of carbon dioxide in air changes with location and the seasons of the year on an annual basis the concentration of carbon dioxide in air rises and falls in a seasonal pattern with the span between the seasonal high and low values typically being about 6 ppmv or about oneandahalf percent of the average annual value these variations in carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere reflect the fact that carbon dioxide is continually being produced and removed from the atmosphere by a multitude of mechanisms and therefore the concentration of co 2 in air at a given place and time reflects both local conditions and global factors there is much concern about and interest in understanding the mechanisms which have caused the concentration of co 2 in air to rise significantly since the first part of the twentieth century around the world many people are seeking to better understand the potential environmental changes which may result if the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere continues to rise at a rapid rate over the next few decades and are seeking to define actions which are prudent to take both as individuals and as governmental bodies to slow the rate of increase    historical background   multiple studies have investigated the composition of fossil air bubbles trapped in thick ice accumulations which have built up over tens and even hundreds of thousands of years samples from antarctica have provided a continuous record going back about 420000 years  they show that longterm cycles of global cooling and warming which typically span a period of about 70000 years or more have been accompanied by characteristic changes in the co2content of the atmosphere the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide found in these fossil air bubbles is typically found to be about 180 ppmv near the end of periods of global cooling and widespread glaciation the concentration of co 2 in air during warmer interglacial periods typically rises from that level to around 300 ppmv consistent with the apparent pattern observed in older samples the carbon dioxide concentration in air bubbles trapped between 18000 to 11000 years ago when the last period of widespread glaciation ended was around 180 ppmv also consistent with the pattern seen in earlier cycles a fairly sharp rise in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide followed the most recent glacial retreats rising at an average rate of about 11 ppmv per thousand years the concentration of co 2 in air increased to 300 ppmv in the first half of the twentieth century a great deal of this longer term rise has been attributed to release of co 2 to the atmosphere as ocean waters slowly warmed postglacial warming was not a straight line phenomenon temperatures rose to modern levels about 9000 years ago but then began to fluctuate between 8000 and 6000 years ago and several times since the average temperature of the nearearth atmosphere has been the same or higher than its current value in fact over the last 7000 years the earth has apparently gone through more than half a dozen significant warming and cooling cycles  while these postglacial changes in temperature were much smaller than those which define glacial and interglacial periods they were strong enough to have a major impact on local climates eg in greenland and in the sahara one of the impacts of global warming over the last 18000 years was a significant rise in average sea level of more than 100 meters or about 330 feet as a great deal of previouslyfrozen water made its way into the earths seas and oceans shorelines about 10000 years ago were tens and even hundreds of miles away from the coastlines we are familiar with about half of this rise was completed by about 10000 years ago then over the next 5000 years sea levels rose further to approximately 5 meters below current levels during the last 5000 years the increase in sea level has continued much more slowly since the midtwentieth century the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere has continued to rise from what can be considered to be a typical interglacial endstage concentration of 300 ppmv to its current value of about 404 ppmv and it has done so at an increasingly rapid rate the rate of carbon dioxide concentration increase is now approximately 25 ppmv  year or an annual growth rate of about 06 there is every reason to believe the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere will continue to increase for several decades at the very least even with attempts to limit the rate of growth of manmade emissions from cars industry and power generation many human activities including the use of carboncontaining fuels for heating industry and transportation and widespread deforestation have undoubtedly contributed to the recent rapid rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration what can be done and what should be done about the rising concentration of co2 in the atmosphere are matters of intense global research and debate  additional details on these topics followssome very long term perspective  evolution of the earths atmosphere over geological time the earths atmosphere has changed drastically over time  the air that we are accustomed to breathing is the product of billions of years of evolving life forms interacting with the seas the land and the air the concentrations of both carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air are the result of a complex dynamic balance between mechanisms which remove these gases and others which replace them about 4 billion years ago the earths atmosphere was mostly co 2 the development of anaerobic bacterial photosynthesis and bluegreen algae cyanobacteria about 35 billion years ago resulted in the release of oxygen to the atmosphere and the sequestering of carbon lowering the level of co2in the atmosphere the changing composition of the atmosphere had a reverse greenhouse effect on the earths energy balance producing a prolonged period about 500 million years of widespread glaciation between 25 and 20 billion years ago as photosynthesizing plants and other life forms such as sea creatures appeared more carbon dioxide was removed and sequestered in organic matter and as carbonate in shells eventually oxygen levels in air increased to near the current level paving the way for new life forms to emerge and evolve which were dependent upon oxygen in the air oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have been maintained at near current levels for millions of years through many dynamic and largelyself regulating interrelationships between the land the seas the air and various life forms oxygen is reactive without replenishment by photosynthesis its concentration in air would decrease as it combined with other elements to form various compounds carbon dioxide is continually produced and removed from the atmosphere by a multitude of natural mechanisms co 2 dissolves in water including rain and carried into rivers lakes and the oceans and it is removed by photosynthesis it is replenished by oxidation of dead organic matter and by animal respiration if the carbon dioxide content of air increases it results in more vigorous plant growth which removes co 2 at a faster rate until a new equilibrium between production and removal is established correlation of carbon dioxide levels in air and global climate  420000 years of data scientific measurements of fossil air bubbles trapped in antarctic ice sheets indicate that over the past four hundred and twenty thousand years the concentration of co 2 in the earths atmosphere has repeatedly fluctuated between about 180 ppmv and 300 ppmv  the lowest concentrations of co 2 in air have corresponded to periods which have followed prolonged and widespread glaciation the highest levels of co2were reached near the end of the warmer interglacial periods this chart which depicts recentlyanalyzed data on the composition of fossil air bubbles trapped in polar ice a set of samples spanning more than 400000 years provides additional perspective current atmospheric co 2 concentrations are now above those which have been typical near the end of the previous four interglacial periods changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration  the last sixty years the charts below shows monthly data on co 2 concentration in the atmosphere between 2012 and the end of 2016 both

below shows changes in the concentration of co 2 in air at the mauna loa test site over almost six decades march 1958 through december 2016 what do these historical records tell us about the current situation very simply we appear to be in uncharted waters atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations measured over the past hundred years or so have been consistently higher than the approximately 300 ppmv level which has typically been reached near the end of earlier interglacial periods and they are rising at a rapid rate there is disagreement about many aspects of cause and potential effect however there is general consensus that the rapid rise in carbon dioxide concentration is cause for concern many people are concerned that increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will lead to increasingly hotter average worldwide temperatures with rising sea levels changes in local climates and inevitable changes in local and global agriculture water resource availability species mix etc some people are concerned that rapid heating may become so disruptive to normal sea salinity levels and heat transfer mechanisms in the oceans that a trend reversal may occur triggering rapid cooling in nearpolar areas and even faster heating in equatorial regions these concerns have triggered intense interest in increasing our collective understanding of what is happening why it is happening how much of the relatively recent rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is due to human activity and what can and should be done to control emissions of carbon dioxide the rising atmospheric co 2level has become a political issue in addition to being a scientific issue people throughout the world are debating the likely impacts of continuing business as usual versus making conscious changes in the way we all consume and discard carboncontaining materials it is clear that historical changes in the level of co 2 in the atmosphere have correlated well with changes in the average temperature of the atmosphere however the two are interdependent and either can be the cause and the other the effect under certain circumstances there are many interactions between natural processes and feedback loops which are at best only partially understood we are seeing widespread efforts to better understand the complex interactions between carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere and average and local atmospheric temperaturethe rate of climate changethe effect of temperature  climate changes on the volume of polar ice storeschanges in ocean levelschanges in salinity in various portions of the oceanschanges in ocean current heat transport circulation patterns which are driven by both temperature and salinity differences and the impact of all of these factors on global weather patterns and ultimately on the livability of many currently inhabited areas and the sustainability of life on earth as we currently know it more information on global warming over the past 11000 yearsglobal warming is not a new phenomenon the earth has gone through many periods of rising and falling average temperature triggered by multiple causes the last period of widespread glaciation reached its maximum about 18000 years ago see map about 11000 years ago after 7000 years of increasing air temperatures glacial ice was in full retreat the average global temperature was still 3 to 5˚c cooler than at the present time early postglacial sea levels were as much as 100 meters 300 feet lower than they are now due to so much of the earths water being locked in ice on land the entire development of human civilization as we know it occurred in this most recent interglacial period our ancestors not only survived but thrived as global warming triggered major changes in local climates and geography within a few thousand years after this interglacial period began rising sea levels fed by melting ice caused land bridges between continents to disappear coastal areas became inundated by sea water and inland river valleys were flooded becoming future sites for both small fishing villages and major cities along these new seacoasts average temperatures did not rise slowly and smoothly to present levels following the last glacial period instead average temperatures increased fairly rapidly until about 8000 years ago at which time they were close to current levels but then warming continued for almost two thousand years rising to higher levels than we have seen recently  around six thousand years ago average temperatures dropped rapidly reaching levels lower than today and stayed lower for a thousand years in fact o ver the past seven thousand years there appear to have been six significant cycles of interglacial cooling and warming warm periods have coincided with significant periods of societal change and architectural accomplishment in many parts of the world the medieval warm period from about 850 until 1250 ad was a time of unusually warm climate in europe other warm periods spanned the peak of egyptian civilization 2600 to 2200 bc the late roman republic and peak of the roman empire roughly 100 bc through 200 ad as well as the twentieth centurythis noaa plot shows the agencys best estimates for average temperatures over the past 1000 years  the medieval warm period was followed by a cooler period which is often referred to as the little ice age it lasted from about the mid to late 1300s into the late 1800s almost 500 years the the bitter cold winters depicted in scenes of the american revolution in the 1770s occurred during this period a little more than one hundred years ago following the end of the last prolonged cool period the titanic hit an iceberg that was one of many which were released as a thenwelcome spell of global warming began to be felt the end of the little ice age period in the mid to late 1800s roughly coincided with the start of a significant rise in industrial activities some people claim that industrialization is the cause of the warming trend since then it may be equally true that the warming trend spawned the vibrant growth of society and industry that began as temperatures began to rise i t is currently popular to point to the increasing industrialization of the world coupled with significant human population growth as primary factors contributing to increases in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere however it is very likely that there are multiple interrelated links between the rise in average global temperatures and the rising carbon dioxide content of air over the past hundred years linkages between global air temperature average ocean temperature and co 2in air the preindustrial rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide at t he end of the last glacial period when air and sea water temperatures were well below current levels the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air was approximately 180 to 200 ppmv as the world warmed the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere rose in the early to mid1800s prior to the end of the little ice age the concentration of co 2 in the air was about 280 ppmv this value has been referred to by many analysts as the preindustrial co2level in the atmosphere much of the rise from the postglacial level of co 2 in the atmosphere to the mid1800s level has been linked to warming of the oceans carbon dioxide in the oceans the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration estimates the oceans contain about 50 times more co2than the atmosphere and 10 times more than plant and soil carbon stores the amount of co 2that the oceans can hold is temperature dependent with much of it held in deep cold waters circulation patterns transport co 2 up and down in the ocean and there is constant interchange of carbon dioxide between the oceans and the atmosphere average temperatures in the ocean change much more slowly than average air temperatures as the average and surface temperatures of the worlds oceans have increased a portion of the stored co 2 has been released to the atmosphere the situation today the rise in atmospheric co 2 concentration which occurred between the early1800s to the mid1900s was gradual in 1960 the average concentration of co2in the atmosphere was about 315 ppmv since the mid1900s the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere has increased significantly and the rate of rise has been accelerating currently the average measurement is about 404 ppmv and the annual average value is rising at about 25 ppmv  year since the acceleration of population growth and industrialization throughout the world in the past 60 years or so coincides with an increase of more than 25 in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere during that same period it is reasonable to assume that many human activities including the use of carboncontaining fuels for heating industry and transportation and widespread deforestation have been and are contributing to the rapid rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration what can be done what should be done and the best way to do what seems prudent to do about the rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
