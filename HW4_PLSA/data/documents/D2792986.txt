its just when i went vegetarian instead of meat i ate junk food which resulted in weight gain i lost the 10 pounds i had gained but im still chubby sizeshow more1 following 51 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer most raw vegans maintain their weight with their diettheyre obviously not perpetually losing weight so raw veganism itself doesnt make you lose weight the types of food you choose to eat dont directly impact your weight loss simply if youre eating less calories now than you were before itll probably take three or four months to lose another 10 pounds if youve just increased your food intake and are consuming the same number of calories as before youll never lose weight i guessed three months because if you eat the bare minimum daily calorie intake 1200day you will probably at most burn one half to one pound a week your body must be short of a full 3000 calories to burn a pound this is why exercising is a much faster and healthier way to lose weight than simply cutting a few calories the only way you can be sure that youre getting enough calories but not too many is to count them if thats not your cup of tea exercise can help balance out your calorie intake on days when you consume too many without realizing exercising can be as easy as walking if youre unhappy with how your body looks losing weight probably wont help since youre already thin youd probably be more content with toning up your body head hauncho · 5 years ago2 5 comment raw vegan diet weight loss source shttpsshrinksima8ikhdenker · 1 year ago0 0 comment raw vegan weight loss source shttpsshrinkima9gr6darjean · 1 year ago0 0 comment not very long on a lfrv low fat raw vegan diet it is the healthiest diet on the planet because it excludes oilsugarprocessed food and a variety of unwanted ingredients that we other people regularly put in our food for taste yet there is no compromise for taste on the lfrv diet i really wish i also could completely be a lfrv but im able to do it only for one meal a day since i stay with my parents and have to eat whatever food my mum makes rest of the time vegan food though on that diet it shouldnt take you very long to lose weight but you should still make sure you arent consuming more calories than you are losing eat wholesomely and moderately dont binge or stuff yourself to a full stomach always leave some place for more thats one way of losing belly fat also if youre looking to get ripped abs eat 6 small meals a day in 2 hour intervals instead of 3 big meals exercise drink a lot of water and eat a lot of fruit

dropped 5 pounds ive been vegan for a year but i decided to change and its paid off taylor ridge · 3 years ago0 0 comment for the best answers search on this site httpsshorturlimavf s3 yes definitely i went vegan and lost weight for a while then i started gaining again because i began to overeat but if you dont overeat you will definitely lose weight there is hardly any fat or calories in raw vegan food eat lots of greens and peas and beans and you wont be short on calcium protein or iron good luck i really hope you do well  it takes practice but soon enough itll click and your weight will drop to the third answer actually vegans live off a diet of high carb and low protein foods its an absolute myth that you need so much protein and iron you can get enough out of veggies and you do not need meat meat is not good for you our intestine is too long to be a carnivore so the meat actually rots as it is passing through unlike a dog who eats mean and has a short intestine meaning the meat passes through before it rots so either have rotting meat in your system or have a healthy high carb low protein diet shital · 2 years ago0 0 comment the diet is too much to handle becaue youre making yourself uncomfortable if you make yourself uncomfortable with dramatic lifestyle changes you wont stick with it i think what will work best for you is one or two small changes at a time that is how a lot of people do it my mom used to be big as the side of the house and she started with small changes first she gave up candy bars and after a week or so she gave up cheese burgers then after another week or so she started walking a little bit and just gradually keep adding those small changes shes fit now i think you could benefit a lot with some nutrition or fitness coaching most people need that because they want to change and have all the drive to do it and stick with it but just dont know what to do or how to start small changes make all the difference i dont know what you do all day but one small change could be to just start taking stairs instead of an elevator or if you have whole milk with your cearal switch to skim or 2 just things like that or if you eat breakfast as school instead of having the biscuits and gravy have fruit and oatmeal or whatever else is available thats a better choice or stop having ketchup with your french fries its all sugar it really does work ive spent lots of money on diet clinics and stuff that use drugs or put you on a really strict diet and the results never lasted because it was just too dramatic and i went back to the same bad habits the only things that ever let to lasting resuts was the small changes that i stuck with like parking far away from buildings and walking through the parking lot rather than parking as close to the door as i could ive even joined extreme fitness classes like crossifr and never stayed with them because it was just too much all at once one thing you can do that you wont really notice is dont eat everything on your plate leave like 20 of it at the end of the month all that food really adds up source s heres the best news of all heres a method that is helping women to lose weight fast

suggest a water fast before going raw and into juicing youre saying that you ate vegetablescooked no meat but that you gave into temptation junk food a water fast will definitely help you to learn about your body more and to become more disciplined in the field of appetite temptation and cravings so when you transition into the raw diet you will have absolute maintenance over your body and its signals by then you contradicted by eating vegetables but also eating junk food but thats a history  you already ate the junk so its in your system you need to completely clean out your system and learn to interpret your body through a lengthy water fast which by the end you will have lost weight and got rid of unwanted poisons associated with stimulating foodsjunk foods a raw diet is about maintenance its about feeding your body and nothing more there is no false bodily signals in a raw diet no leading of the brain in drinking coffee at a certain time the ritualistic ways of popping in a cookie and opening a bag of chips no where someone that may eat highly stimulating foods and then think of vegetables they would think they are pointless however once you water fast and break through all the artificial false consciousness about food you will learn what your body really needs how much and when to eat when to stop you will also have a new outlook on food anonymous · 5 years
