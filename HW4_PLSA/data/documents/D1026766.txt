demons you have a gift from god above you can see demons you are amazing constantine77 4 years ago this is an old thread but i just wanted to say that ive seen the same thing in peoples faces usually i can see it at night when the lights are dim sometimes i see a totally different face than the one i see during the daytime the vision usually has some message for me like one friends face looked like a fat ugly pig she looked like she had two faces and indeed she was twofaced she has a sneaky deceitful side to her one friend looked like an angel even more beautiful than she is usually and shes stunning and although we have our problems she gave me some advice once that was lifesaving to me another friend looked like his eyes were hollow and dark like pits he turned out not to be a very good person for me theres some darkness in his life and he brought it with him into mine always go with your gut reaction if what you see looks like jekyll and hyde then you are being warned that this person isnt good to have in your life whether theres an entity involved or just bad human behaviorpoppy888 5 years ago have you considered talking to your doctor about schizophrenia seeing evil and such in people s faces is a symptom the danger is one day you will feel like cleaning up depleting or getting rid of the evil and hurt somebody or imagine the evil is after you then rise up in self defence people have died see a doctor to rule out a mental condition if it is not that then embrace that whichever way you choose as a gift if you like but i will see a doctor firstromida 5 years ago this has happened to me many years ago and i do not believe it is your ability to see evil in people in my case a demon was taunting me it was appearing in peoples faces to scare me i was a teenager when it happened and i had asked my mom to sleep with me a few times and i had to face the other way because i was terrified to turn towards her because i was just imagine her turning her face towards me with a demonish face my grandfather has experienced this too it came to a point where i was so terrified that i had prayed the our father over and over and over until i suddenly felt a heat in my ear like it was coming out of me and my head fell silent it was the most peaceful experiencetraveler8 7 years ago i dont think youre crazy maybe thats a gift you have like mediums or people who have rare abilities sometimes you meet people that seem to be overconfident that do things and dont see its wrong or see it but like to be bad for no reason i really dont understand those people that get angry and punish other people for their bad luck or problems like the kind of people that kill and then commit suicide well there are people like that doing bad things and really wanting to do it and feel no shame at all sometimes i think people overconfident are evil because they can do things and think they can get away with any excuses sometimes i think i see some evil on faces too but its not really like a shadow its more in the look they have on their eyes like they did something and are waiting to see what will happen the look is like a mix ofdefying a child that hurt an animal and hopes he hasnt been seenimagine for a moment the look on the eyes of a guy who just raped a girl something like that is what i see on faces could you tell if what you talk about is like something like in the movie of the exorcism of emily rose your visions really look scary i hope for you they will stop or go awayconstantine39 9 years ago dude lay off the crack pipe we all can see evil spirits in people and each other its called being mortalduckster 9 years ago hales i have had a similiar experience where i did not like the vibes i was getting off a person that person later went on to commit two murders and is currently in jail i dont think i am psychic but my grandmother was able to see ghostsduckster 9 years ago chaz you have a gift from god in 1st corinthians 1210 the ability to distinguish between spirits one reason you might see an evil spirit on someone you believe to be of good heart is that past generations can curse future generations by their sins i have just gone through a deliverance from evil spirits cleansing service at a church and have really had my eyes opened to the bad effects of being affected by an evil spirit and having the bad spirit and the cause correctly detected i truly believe someone can see and know an evil spirit is dwelling in a personhales3 10 years ago wow that is realllly creepy i dont see evil faces i can just tell when someone is bad or that i wont get along with them right away like as soon as they walk in a room their energy just changes everything you are not crazy and your best bet would be to not to talk to anyone who is very seriously religious like a minister or something they will always most likely tell you you are crazy because only god should have these powers he gave us a little something to protect ourselves too dont you think it would only make senselrt0400 10 years ago i have noticed a lot of people have seen things when there grandfather has died i have read a lot of people here storys and just like

still interested glenda sc 10 years ago holli  you are such a funny person and i needed it my new store manager chewed me today we had an expensive chair lift chir without padding on the foot rest a chaise padded one to be official and i told someone not to buy it for an 89 falling person moved to a nursing home i just chewed my store person back  in a polite way told her it was wrong take it or tell me to go home then i got a big order it happens didnt expect it none of the other people sell much i do she backed off i dont sell elderly peoples comfort i had forgotten this discussion totally but this helped me today remember what they needed i am awe struckhollinor 10 years ago ha ha glenda i love old people theyre so ornery and set in their ways my grandmother cracks me up when she lived in her home shes in a nursing home right now i used to silently giggle when she would tell me to get something for her it didnt matter that shed been living there since before i was born and everything had a certain place she had to describe exactly where it was go bring me a fork its in the drawer to the left of the sink on the right hand side next to the spoons uh exactly where its been for the last thirty years lol and dont let her send you to the store for something youd better come back with exactly that or shes going to have a fit literally its del monte brand peaches and nothing else i remember she sent me and my cousin to the pharmacy to get her some depends bladdercontrol undergarments she sent us with the empty bag so that we could see exactly what kind she needed i was embarrassed to be walking around with a depends bag but my grandmother would often send us to the store with handfuls of labels ripped off cans or empty product bags glenda sc 10 years ago chaz  with children and elderly people im a real marshmellow too much it can cause problems i was told to stand strong with bad stuff and mean people im not phased its natural for me odd but true we all have our weak areas i assure you so if something is messing with you all i can tell you is to stand strong call up god if it goes too far i dont think he minds its my sincere hope that he even has sense of humor i certainly do the next time you see a bad face draw mentally a tutu on it or party hat perhaps that will lessen your fear i use to do this with chemistry molecular diagrams it made them less fearsome and easier to memorize i made pictures my friend carmen thought it was funny chaz30 10 years agothe face is never differnt its always the same its like a dark shadowy figure that goes from the top of the peoples face and down there body i will try to draw what i see and the put it on here glenda sc 10 years ago im tired worked a lot today and new but i do think that there are bad things that trick to bring down our spirits  however and anyway they can bring them down i once dreamed of my mom and she called me a semibad name which hurt my feelings then i thought its a trick she would never say this to me then i realized it was a trick it only happened once about a year after i lost her and was vulnerable that day it was a real dream but it was hooey i think tricks happen in many ways watch for them edmund 10 years ago chaz30 i can see where it would be overwhelming i was just curious to find out if you see that persons so called personal demon or if it was a demon that was connected with a specific sin and that you saw on several people like lets say sloth the sin of being lazy and you know that him him and her are like that and the face that you see superimposed on them is somewhat the same or again is the face always different  chaz30 10 years ago thanks it just gets overwhelming sometimes i did find out later that my exwife had done some terrible things but as far as my best friend i dont know he was a good person he would give his shirt off his back to help someone as for myself ive never dabbled in the dark arts i have misbehaved when i was younger but grew out of it now i go to church and have been saved for my sins edmund 10 years ago chaz30 ive seen it on my exwife too  but seriously its one of two things your being given a heads up on the persons hidden agenda during the 10 years that you have had this ability it should have been confirmed somebody that you have seen the faceover on should have been picked up for some type of morals crime the second type is somewhat rarer where by design or by accident you become involved in some dabbling in the dark arts and you become haunted if the face is pretty similar then go with the haunted statementhollinor 10 years ago oh no you are not crazy nor alone i have come across some of the most beautiful looking people that look downright hideous you can always see whats on the inside showing through peoples faces i have such a hard time trying not to be judgemental because of what i can see i remember driving once it was on the street from my house i would occasionally pass by the same red truck on the road that was because there was only one way in and out where we lived anyway this particular time i passed by the red truck and looked at the driver what i saw made my blood run cold i could see his normal face but on top of it was the most heinous evillooking face i had ever seen i dont know what he had just done or was about to do but whatever it was it wasnt good im still trying to learn how to deal with this ability to see what others cannot see for example they think soandso is such a great person and im like oh no they like looking at kidde porn of course they think im off my rocker i have to learn when to say something and when to keep my mouth shut to publish a comment or vote you need to be logged in use the login form at the top of the page if you dont have
