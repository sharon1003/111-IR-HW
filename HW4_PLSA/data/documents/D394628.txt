a person whose mobility would be otherwise significantly impaired by one or more of age illness disability or infirmity the permit allows exemption from street parking charges in some places and is used to park within dedicated disabled parking spaces reserved for people who have satisfied requirements to receive the placard in 1978 the ecmt council of ministers agreed that all member countries of the ecmt would grant the same parking concessions to people with disabilities as they offered their own nationals these concessions usually allowed special parking in areas reserved for people with disabilities or allowed longer parking periods or exemptions from charges this resolution was updated and extended in scope in 1997 in addition to all the member countries of ecmt this resolution now applies also to the ecmt associated countries australia canada japan korea new zealand and united states this means that disabled motorists from all ecmt member and associate countries are now entitled to the same parking concessions as nationals in all ecmt countries the only condition is the display of a badge showing the international wheelchair symbol in 1998 the eu adopted a resolution along the same lines for the member countries of the eu the badges to be displayed are to be standardized to facilitate recognition and to avoid difficulties at local level australia austria belgium

permits bearing the international wheelchair symbol are widely recognized provided they are officially issued travelers who have disabled parking permits from other countries may be able to use them in canada the permits i am referring to must be official ones not home made i have used the following terms interchangeably to describe the disabled parking placardblue badgehandicapped parking badgedisabled parking badgebadgeplacardparking passparking permit there is no national level scheme for issuing and regulating the use of disabled parking permits the blue and white international wheelchair symbol is used in canada on the actual parking placard called a badge in some countries the recognition of handicapped parking permits is at the provincial level in alberta for example you can go to a local registry office and for a fee purchase a temporary alberta permit in practice few canadian travelers from other provinces would consider doing this the reality is that as long as you are not abusing the system an official parking pass from another jurisdiction should be quite acceptable provided it is officially issued and has the universal symbol on it where it would be advisable to check more carefully if you intend to drive in the downtown areas of the major cities toronto montreal vancouver and to attend events at popular venues eg sports arenas concert halls and where disabled parking might be in high demand eg hospitals shopping centres then it would be a good idea to contact the local parking authority to get their advice on whether your parking permit will be recognized for most of the country we are fortunate in canada in having a reasonable amount of parking and if you can travel at nonpeak hours in particular you should have no problems for visitors from the united states the recognition of the handicapped parking badge from the us is probably covered under a bilateral agreement but i was unable to find one yet in practice if your permit looks like a canadian one  white on blue using the international symbol for a wheelchair  the local authorities are likely to respect it this does not mean you should make your own placard to be official the placard has to have been issued officially and should appear so for visitors from european union countries the article disabled parking permits in europe explains that holders of canadian and other disabled parking permits may use them in the eu when the eu adopted this resolution the various canadian provinces agreed to implement it as the issuance of disabled parking permits is done by the provinces and in the north by the municipalities not by the territorial governments thus if you come from anywhere in the eu bring your parking permit and it should be honored there are some differences in the exact rights a blue parking badge gives you in canada for a description of how canadian disabled parking permits operate and a brief note on how they differ from permits elsewhere please read this executive summary and in particular the section on parking badge policies in canada the typical practice in canada is that if you have an official blue handicapped parking badge with the international wheelchair symbol on it hanging from your vehicles rear view mirror you may park the vehicle in one of the marked designated handicapped parking spots these are usually at the main entrance of the building or site you are visiting as is the case everywhere the disabled parking spots can be in short supply at peak hours if you are concerned try to research the destination on the internet or by phone before going there for visitors from elsewhere the same general advice applies as for the usa if you have a standard placard officially issued bring it to canada
