muddled nfc why not the redskins the redskins put jonathan allen on injured reserve and brought in a familiar face to replace him on the roster jay gruden announced that the team has signed former practice squad member a j francis to take the place of allen who suffered a lisfranc injury last sunday in the game against the 49ers francis spent part of last season on the redskins practice squad and he was on the 53man roster for a couple of weeks although he did not appear in a game francis also was on the team this year before being released in the cut to 53 on september 2 the former maryland standout has played in three nfl games all in 2015 appearing in two for the seahawks and one for the dolphins related m ore on allens injuryin all francis has been a part of 22 transactions starting when he signed with the dolphins as an undrafted free agent in 2013 allen has undergone surgery to repair the foot already the normal schedule for a lisfranc calls for a player to stay off of the foot for 68 weeks and then start rehabbing which can take a month or possibly a lot longer he would be eligible to be activated off of injured reserve after missing eight games which means he technically could play in week 15 against the cardinals but that would be an extremely optimistic timetable for such an injury more redskins mustsee photos from redskins 26 49ers 24stay up to date on

thursday october 19 four days before the washington redskins visit the philadelphia eagles on monday night football timeline today’s schedule practice 1 pm jay gruden and kirk cousins news conferences open locker room after practice approx 3 pm days until —cowboys  redskins 1029 10 —redskins  seahawks 115 17 —giants  redskins thanksgiving 1123 35jonathan allen’s absence the redskins defensive line has been one of the most improved positions on the team now they have a large hole to fill in that unit jonathan allen’s lisfranc injury will require surgery and that means he will be sidelined for the rest of the season he likely will go on injured reserve sometime this week the team’s firstround draft pick had been playing very well he has helped to provide the redskins with pass rush up the middle an important element that has been missing from the defense the 17th overall pick had a sack three qb hits and 10 hurries what will the redskins do in allen’s absence the first thing they’ll do is take consolation in the fact that they still have matt ioannidis to give them some inside pass rush the secondyear player rebounded from a 2016 season where he played sparingly and is providing consistent pass rush pressure between the tackles he has 35 sacks and 16 pressures but ioannidis can’t do it alone he and allen each benefitted from the presence of the other one and edge rushers preston smith and ryan kerrigan have both been helped by the attention the other teams had to pay to the pass pressure threat from the interior with allen gone who will take his place that question has a few different answers when allen goes on injured reserve a lineman will be signed to take his place that could be rookie brandon banks who has been on the practice squad all year they could bring up a j francis who has been around on the practice squad for a couple of years but he has not been with a team since he was release in redskins’ cut to 53 on september 2 they also could find a veteran who is not currently working or sign a player off of another team’s practice squad the redskins tried out 16 players on tuesday and the only defensive lineman among them was owa odighizuwa who played in 18 games for the giants in 20152016 but whoever takes the roster spot likely will be inactive most of the time anthony lanier the secondyear defensive end who has been on the team this year but has not been active for a game will be active on monday night he is a passrush specialist and it seems likely that he will get most of allen’s snaps in nickel situations in base defense stacy mc gee and terrell mc clain will rotate in more frequently it’s not as though they have been sitting on the bench this season while the rotation has favored allen and ioannidis mc clain and mc gee have played 131 snaps this year ziggy hood has 155 ioannidis 170 and allen 159 mc clain and mc gee are ok defending the run so there won’t be a huge drop off there the spotlight will be on lanier who played in just four games last year before an injury ended his season to continue to get push up the middle with ioannidis he will get his chance on monday as the redskins take on the eagles in the season opener the redskins were able to get pressure on quarterback carson wentz 22 pressures on 41 pass dropbacks but they weren’t often able to bring him down we will see if lanier can get to him a time or two and finish the job stay up to date on the redskins rich tandler covers the team 365 days a year like his facebook page facebookcomtandler nbcs and follow him on twittertandler nbcs tandler
