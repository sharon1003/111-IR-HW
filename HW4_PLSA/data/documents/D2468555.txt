immigration why birthright citizenship is good for america the fourteenth amendment’s citizenship clause granting birthright citizenship has aided immigrant assimilation in the united states by alex nowrasteh august 1 2016the fourteenth amendment to the u s constitution adopted 148 years ago on july 9 provides for the grant of birthright citizenship to the americanborn children of immigrants regardless of their legal status troublingly many have criticized this constitutional right lately but critics need to know how valuable it is perhaps most importantly one major unintentional benefit of the fourteenth amendment is that it speeds assimilation for children of immigrants immigrants to the united states assimilate very quickly speaking of america’s openness to immigrants former president ronald reagan stated “an immigrant can live in france but not become a frenchman he can live in germany but not become a german he can live in japan but not become japanese but anyone from any part of the world can come to america and become an american”recent mammoth research projects on immigrant assimilation carried out by the national academy of sciences and the organization for economic cooperation and development bear out president reagan’s quote to sum up his own research that comes to similar conclusions university of washington professor jacob vigdor wrote  “basic indicators of assimilation from naturalization to english ability are if anything stronger now than they were a century ago”americans immigrants and their descendants become americans fortunately our system of birthright citizenship makes that assimilation and integration process even easier those who want to curtail birthright citizenship need only look at societies that accept large numbers of immigrants but don’t extend birthright citizenship to their children the results there are often not pretty the history of birthright citizenship first a little bit of history the fourteenth amendment was enacted in the aftermath of the civil war to guarantee that freed slaves and others would have constitutional rights visàvis their state governments the amendment included the citizenship clause to overrule the 1857 supreme court dred scott v sandford decision that in part stated black americans could never become citizens the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment reads “all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside” this clause was not a departure from angloamerican common law which embraced birthright citizenship going back centuries the debate over the fourteenth amendment’s passage made it clear that both proponents and opponents understood it would extend citizenship to the children of asian and other nonwhite immigrants who were under the existing immigration law unable to naturalize sen jacob howard introduced the citizenship clause during senate debate he said it “will not of course include persons in the united states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the united states but will include every other class of persons ” emphasis added a provision similar to the citizenship clause appeared in the civil rights act of 1866 in president johnson’s list of complaints he sent to congress along with his veto of that act he listed the citizenship clause he griped “this provision comprehends the chinese of the pacific states indians subject to taxation the people called gipsies as well as the entire race designated as blacks people of color negroes mulattoes and persons of african blood every individual of these races born in the united states is by the bill made a citizen of the united states”denying birthright citizenship is dangerous the u s rule of birthright citizenship offers a stark contrast to policies pursued in germany and japan where the children of immigrants are either denied citizenship or face a much harder path toward obtaining it the german guestworker program of the 1950s through the 1970s admitted large numbers of turks tunisians portuguese and others to work in their growing economy originally the germans had no intention of letting the workers and their families stay permanently but many especially the turks did stay their germanborn children were not allowed to become citizens the same was true in japan where the korean minority called zainichi was barred from citizenship for generations despite being born in japan in both countries the results were tragic the lack of birthright citizenship created a legal underclass of resentful and displaced young people who were officially discriminated against in the governmentrun education system and had tenuous allegiance to the country in which they were born after four generations in japan ethnic koreans still selfidentify as foreign in both countries these noncitizen youths are more prone to crime and extreme political ideologies like islamism or communism their failure to naturalize the turks contrasts with germany’s aussiedler system that “repatriated” ethnic germans and their families living in the territory of the soviet union immediately granting them citizenship by virtue of their blood connection to germany aussliedler inflows peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s when approximately 22 million ancestral germans were admitted and given citizenship germany partly rectified its system in 1999 extending citizenship to turks and creating some legal categories that can gain citizenship through birthright equality breeds contentment youths born to noncitizen immigrants in countries without birthright citizenship have little legal stake in the nations they were born in but also have no place to go many might gain citizenship through the ethnicity of their parents in korea or turkey but with no connections to those nations citizenship there is meaningless in the united states by contrast children of immigrants are legally on the same playing field as children born to american citizens both can serve in the military purchase firearms serve on juries and be treated the same by the legal system that is one reason why 89 percent of secondgeneration hispanics and 96 percent of thirdgeneration hispanics have described themselves as american only “hispanicamerican” or “mexicanamerican” is still popular among some after several generations just as “italianamerican” still survives but these americans do not view themselves as foreigners the likelihood of amending the fourteenth amendment’s citizenship clause is small but that amendment should be defended because of how well it has aided immigrant assimilation in the united states remembering the fourteenth amendment as a correction to previous racist policies and court decisions is essential but that history should not blind us to its proassimilation impact on the descendants of america’s immigrants alex nowrasteh is the immigration policy analyst at the cato institute’s center for global liberty and

every medium or large city the problem with automatic citizenship is what it brings with it these anchor babies drag a whole extended family into our welfare system and once theyre in they stay the first gen immigrants both legal and moreso illegal do the jobs americans wont do well talk later about how our welfare system makes it desirable to not work the men do the labor and yard work not my yard though at 69 ive cut grass since i was ten and dont plan to stop and low skill construction work the next gen however is a different story they want what the middle class has sometimes thats ok because the learn the skills especially office skills and advance up the earnings tree others though go for the short cut of crime including criminal gangs in both cases though they are harmful to americans there are only so many office and other basic skilled jobs and more in that workforce creates more unemployment meanwhile their brothers or sons are criminals including violent criminals no we are not better off for having the 14th amendment as it stands and by the way there can be a middle ground between the japanese system and ours a baby born here can have the same status as his parents if one acknowledged parent is a citizen so is the baby if both are resident aliens so is the baby all if here legally can apply for citizenship if both parents are illegalthe big problem here in texasthen so should the baby be illegal and all are eligible for deportation on the next busa palmer jr • 1 year ago actually since many hispanics cant prove theyre here legally in our country we can round them up and dispatch them and their families back across the border when trump gets in we will probably be shooting them if they try to cross the border again no daddy ball 1 • 1 year ago that would be a great start 300 yard kill zone on the border with mines gerald hughes • 1 year ago i would give any state government on the mexican border 3 months a year free i will supply my own weapon and ammo and sleeping bag all they have to do is give me a couple of mres day and a law that says anyone crossing the border at other that an authorized place can be shot where found mega mouse gw • 1 year ago put a bounty on the heads of illegals i say 100 each should do ithillbillyguy • 1 year ago post snipers on the border with orders not to shoot people going south mega mouse gw • 1 year ago station military troops every 14 mile along the border with strict orders to shoot to kill anyone stepping on us soil at any place other than a legal crossing and once the wall is built install gemini guns on the top with motion and heat sensing capabilities that will shoot anything within 300 feet of them1776patriot • 1 year ago i have been saying that just like that movie where they walled off scottland due to a disease they just need a few people there for maintenance and to watch the surveillance camerasclifford matson • 1 year ago no just build a 3 sided jail with the 4th side the mexican border bet it would have wall to wall guards tony • 1 year ago just do what they do on the southern mexican borderrabs • 1 year agoplaying too many video games arent ya mega mouse gw • 1 year ago i would prefer the border patrol shoot them before they get a chance to get too far into the usa all of them jesus sanchez • 1 year ago hope sopeter burrascano • 1 year ago it would be a great use of all those inactive land mines that were not using any more felicity • 1 year ago there are more chinese now arriving to give birthchinese men can rent the uterus of an american women to give them with insemination an anchor child18wheelfixer • 1 year ago the part that most liberals are missing all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof an illegal alien isnt in the jurisdiction of the state or federal government they are here illegally so that proves that they are not under any jurisdiction if they were under a jurisdiction their crime of coming here illegally would be punished doug brewer • 1 year ago exactly you get ithgthomas • 1 year ago black folks have always done the jobs others wont do and still we are at the bottom of the totem pole in this country i love america i do but there are some things i just will not jump on the bandwagon about islamists are an invasive group they are not willing to assimilate rather their desire is to make this country just as oppressive as the ones they came from they do not understand the concept of freedom markjohn • 1 year ago everyone at some point does work that others wont do that is a complete myth and i quite agree with you those who do not come to assimilate and become americans should not be acceptedhgthomas • 1 year ago if they did the work it isnt myth it is fact gia brown • 1 year ago what jobs are you referring to can you be more specific so we can have a legitimate discussion what jobs are black people doing that any other colorethnicityrace of people cant wont or are not doing if such a job exists why do you believe only black people are doing it or the majority of the job holders doug brewer • 1 year ago sen jacob howard introduced the citizenship clause during senate debate he said it “will not of course include persons in the united states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the united states but will include every other class of persons” emphasis added note he said foreigners illegal immigrants are foreigners therefore neither them nor their spawn should become naturalized citizens until they follow all the rules of naturalizationannie500 • 1 year ago you are so right as the libs like to say that is the law of the land a • 1 year ago youre cherrypicking your data bowserb indeed gang members are 46 hispaniclatino in large citiesprecisely because latinos are highly likely to be concentrated in such cities in suburban areas gang members become predominately black and in rural areas the number of whites in gangs rises and the percent of hispanics in gangs drops to 24 far less than the 56 who are black therefore the correlation has more to do with the location than the ethnicity places with high concentrations of latinos and blacks the city are more likely to have hispanic and latino gang membersis this really surprising this info is publicly available at the national gang center that doesnt necessarily mean youre wrong about the 14th amendment though i agree with you partway namely that children of illegal immigrants should not become automatic citizens by my thinking if you have come illegally you have already broken the law and thus have refused to recognize the sovereignty of the united states thereby making illegal immigrants not subject to our jurisdiction therefore their children should not become citizens i am okay with citizenship for the children of those whom we have permitted to come and live here since that is the ultimate goal in any casea palmer jr • 1 year ago i think we should use the legal term fruit from the poisoinous tree if your parents are illegal and they had you here then you are illegal alsosparcboy • 1 year ago blacks and whites arent streaming across the border dropping anchor babies which is the subject your statistics are irrelevant to that point a • 1 year ago they are indeed relevant if the high number of hispanic gangs is caused not by the nature of their being hispanic but by the nature of their living in the city then you cannot blame that immigration for gangs because the gangs are a product of the inner city not the ethnicity or immigrant status of the gang members robert • 1 year agothen you cannot blame that immigration for gangs yes you can  they would be gang bangers no matter where they were and likely were in mexico or whatever 3rd world shit hole they came from they stay in cities because the volume of people gives them endless amounts of victims  its easier to hide the city did not make them a gangbanger it was an opportunity for a gang bangerjohn holmes • 1 year agowhat a pathetic attempt to justify bad behavior live in city  gangs  step up your game shill a • 1 year ago lets not play ignorant here holmes you and i know full well that the gangs dont appear magically by virtue of living in the city it is what goes on in the city that causes rises in gangs as much as the left wants to pretend it doesnt exist there is a culture of poverty it is a vicious circle in which inner city gangs produce violence which destroys chances of getting ahead which results in more violence im not excusing the gangs because its their fault in the first place what i am saying is that the reason that a higher percent gang members in cities are hispanics is because there are more hispanics in the city its basic statistical selection bias if i pick an allwhite town in west virginia and study its gangs all of its gang members will be white of course because the town is white the reason gang members are latinos in el paso is because there are more latinos in el paso selection bias is a logical fallacyhgthomas • 1 year ago gang mentality is brought with them having lived in la and followed the immigrant problem for years they continue to be what they already areannie500 • 1 year ago you cant run away from home because no matter where you go you that yourself with you dark one • 1 year ago the only ignorance i see here is from you a dong wang • 1 year ago you do realize his entire point is not only factual but obvious right well i suppose i should say obvious to anyone with even half a functioning brainrefugeesillegalsgohome • 1 year ago again when the city was mostly white years ago this was not a problem i am from chicago and can tell you personally 1776patriot • 1 year ago that is not true at all look at who comes here illegally poor unskilled hispanics not just from mexico but from other central and south american countries and closing the border will not be the first time the usa has done that we need to start being more selective on who we will let in to our country only people that will benefit society the current administration wanting to bring in all the terrorist syrians and others from third world countries will not be able to speak english have any skills predominately will be uneducated and having lived in 3 different muslim countries myself know that their lifestyles are very lazy on top of every thing else a • 1 year ago i dont disagree with your opinion on the border at all we do need to end illegal immigration which is 0 selective because it lets in everyone good and bad and i agree that we should be taking in people form wartorn areas like syria not just for our sake but for the real refugees as well what good are we doing the actual refugees if were taking in both them and the terrorists the terrorists will just kill us all here instead of syria my only beef is with the idea that somehow latinos are unique in bringing in gangs theyre not there is nothing specific about latino culture that makes gangs the problem is illegal immigration period because it lets in bad people along with good people theres no selectivity it has nothing to do with the ethnicity of the people coming in it has to do with the fact that porous borders let criminals come in with ease and these criminals go hide in the city dong wang • 1 year ago actually it matters not what  of the total gang population within an area is comprised of which race it matters what  of each race are gang members your point that the population concentration changes your numbers is mute the likelihood for an illegal to commit further crime aside from violating and international border is greater than that of those immigrants who go thru the legal steps to come here the right way we wa • 1 year ago you need to look up moot and mute not to mention an and and remarkably your brain seems to be functioning but it would be more obvious if you were to learn words dong wang • 1 year ago way to argue an actual point you phuking trashrat sorry i type quickly and use my phone you winrefugeesillegalsgohome • 1 year ago back when my old chicago neighborhood albany park was jewish in the 50s and 60s there were no gangs there now it is nothing but gangs everywhere and chock full of latinos they bring their failed culture with them everywhere they go a • 1 year ago latinos do not have a failed culture the problem is that when you have porous borders like we do and let everyone in the bad are just as likely to come as the good legal immigration tends to weed out the criminalsillegal immigration lets them all in my family used to live in an area of new york that went from irish to italian to latino to chinese every time it switched a new gang showed up now we have two options here we can either assume that the irish italians latinos and chinese all by massive coincidence have completely unrelated failed cultures that produces gangs or that by letting in the bad with the good the gangs showed up to follow the good people i tend to go with the latterhgthomas • 1 year ago they bring the gang mentality with them ese nia provenzano • 1 year ago the 46 of gang members at 17 of the us populationwho are latino refers to the whole country in places like lamore like 75 of gang members doug brewer • 1 year ago solution to gang problem all gang members caught doing a crime any crime automatic ten year prison term in a state set up to control only gang members they grow their own food make their own clothes etc they should be housed in a well isolated area with no vehicles kept on the premises any escape attempts by any inmates constitutes 30 days lock down of entire prison any fights or assaults of any type 30 day lock down any rule violation considered major by the officer in charge to be dealt with at his or her discretion medical facility for minor emergencies to be handled by trained guards and inmates major medical handled by outside hospital inmate transported via helicopter no recreational facility or weight training equipment supplied all inmates subject to 30 minute morning supervised exercises push ups jumping jacks etc remember it is a prison not a health spa inmates who show an interest may be educated for a after release profession and counseling during the last year of confinement all illegals deported after sentence is fulfilled a • 1 year ago the irony is that you probably wouldnt even have to go that far we treat most criminals like royalty in prisons today the terrorist in gitmo had a volleyball court and tv or something like that i dont like mandatory minimums but i agree 100 that all illegal immigrants should be immediately deported after committing a crime technically we would be within our rights to deport them all since coming into this country illegally is a crime but at the bare minimum no illegal immigrant that commits a second crime should ever set foot in this nation again the sad thing is we dont even do that right nowannie500 • 1 year agoatahe death penalty would a nice choice dong wang • 1 year ago no doug the solution is that the army rolls thru every single town city village etc in the country and puts a bullet in the head of every gang banger then their family is responsible for the cleans up we wa • 1 year ago very thoughtful not likely therefore to find employment with our guvmint or prisons nicholas g • 1 year ago i dont mind the birthright citizenship cause it is a longstanding tradition but if their parents are illegal they have two choices in my opinion take their child with them to their home country and apply for citizenship or leave them in the care of the state and go back to their home country hopefully we can reform their child to be a productive member of society and not a criminal like their parents
