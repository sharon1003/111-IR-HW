course overview depression information understanding depression treating depression side effects of antidepressants tweetthe main reason for people stopping a course of depression medication is the side effects of the antidepressant it is becoming clearer and clearer that antidepressants are far from benign drugs and unfortunately the combination of depression and medication as well as still being very much trial and error has some unique worries due to the nature of the condition itself as with all drugs some people react badly to antidepressants whilst side effects can seem quite mild in others the irony here of course is that helpful as antidepressants may be for some people at some times these side effects can be very depressing in themselves because no one antidepressant has been proven to be any more effective than any other the choice of which drug to prescribe often rests on their different side effectsthe overwhelming popularity of ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was in part due to their apparent safety over more toxic drugs when used improperly some of the tricyclics are extremely toxic in overdose such as dothiepin amitriptyline and imiprimine however in addition to other dangers there is also an established direct link between suicide and violent behaviour and the use of ssris 1actually all the effects even the desired effects can be considered a side effect of taking a pill the reason there are so many side effects with antidepressants is really due to the lack of full understanding about how antidepressants and depression affect the brain this can be very different from case to case even the drug companies themselves admit that they dont quite know how the drugs work 2antidepressant treatment is often very much a sledgehammer to crack a nut especially in cases of mild to moderate depression bombarding an incredibly delicate and well balanced system with external chemicals on a longterm basis is bound to create unpleasant side effects one of the desired side effects is to change the mood of the person taking the antidepressant st johns wort hypericum has been shown to be as effective as antidepressants and have fewer

an orgasm men and womenloss of libido agitation anxiety see below for the side effects of specific antidepressant types uncovering the new truths about ssris one of the reasons that ssris including paxil prozac luvox zoloft celexa are so widely prescribed by doctors and psychiatrists is because they are safer in overdose this is obviously a good thing because traditionally the most common form of suicide was to overdose on the very antidepressants which were meant to help relieve the depression however there are two very real dangers with sari one that has recently been the basis of an historic court battle in the us ssris pose greater risks when taken with other drugs due to their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties for example ssris can be lethal when taken with maois while being safer in overdose ssris have actually been proven to increase thoughts of suicide or self harm other side effects of ssris nausea diarrhea headaches sexual side effects are also common with ssris such as loss of libido failure to reach orgasm and erectile problems seratonergic syndrome is also a worrying condition associated with the use of ssris side effects of tcas tricyclic

seizures individuals taking maois may have to be careful about eating certain smoked fermented or pickled foods drinking certain beverages or taking some medications because they can cause severe high blood pressure in combination with the medication a range of other less serious side effects occur including weight gain constipation dry mouth dizziness headache drowsiness insomnia and sexual side effects problems with arousal or satisfaction ssris and snris tend to have fewer and different side effects such as nausea nervousness insomnia diarrhea rash agitation or sexual side effects problems
