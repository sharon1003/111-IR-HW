at the other 6 scottish english may be influenced to varying degrees by scots 7 8 many scots speakers separate scots and scottish english as different registers depending on social circumstances 9 some speakers code switch clearly from one to the other while others style shift in a less predictable and more fluctuating manner 9 generally there is a shift to scottish english in formal situations

links background  editscottish english resulted from language contact between scots and the standard english of england after the 17th century the resulting shifts to english usage by scotsspeakers resulted in many phonological compromises and lexical transfers often mistaken for mergers by linguists unfamiliar with the history of scottish english 11 furthermore the process was also influenced by interdialectal forms hypercorrections and spelling pronunciations 12 see the section on phonology below history  edita book of psalms printed in the reign of james vi and iconvention traces the influence of the english of england upon scots to the 16thcentury reformation and to the introduction of printing 13 printing arrived in london in 1476 but the first printing press was not introduced to scotland for another 30 years 14 texts such as the geneva bible printed in english were widely distributed in scotland in order to spread protestant doctrine king james vi of scotland became king james i of england in 1603 since england was the larger and richer of the two kingdoms james moved his court to london in england the poets of the court therefore moved south and began adapting the language and style of their verse to the tastes of the english market 15 to this event mc clure attributes the sudden and total eclipse of scots as a literary language 15 the continuing absence of a scots translation of the bible meant that the translation of king james into english was used in worship in both countries the acts of union 1707 amalgamated the scottish and english parliaments however the church educational and legal structures remained separate this leads to important professional distinctions in the definitions of some words and terms there are therefore words with precise definitions in scottish english which have either no place in english english or have a different definition phonology  editspeech example an example of a scottish male with a middleclass renfrewshire accent problems playing this file see media help the speech of the middle classes in scotland tends to conform to the grammatical norms of the written standard particularly in situations that are regarded as formal highland english is slightly different from the variety spoken in the lowlands in that it is more phonologically grammatically and lexically influenced by a gaelic substratum similarly the english spoken in the northeast of scotland tends to follow the phonology and grammar of doric although pronunciation features vary among speakers depending on region and social status there are a number of phonological aspects characteristic of scottish english scottish english is a rhotic accent meaning r is typically pronounced in the syllable coda the phoneme r may be a postalveolar approximant ɹ as in received pronunciation or general american but speakers have also traditionally used for the same phoneme a somewhat more common alveolar tap ɾ or now very rare the alveolar trill r 16 hereafter ⟨r⟩ will be used to denote any rhotic consonant although other dialects have merged nonintervocalic ɛ ɪ ʌ before r  fern–fir–fur merger  scottish english makes a distinction between the vowels in fern fir and fur many varieties contrast o and ɔ before r so that hoarse and horse are pronounced differentlyor and ur are contrasted so that shore and sure are pronounced differently as are pour and poorr before l is strong an epenthetic vowel may occur between r and l so that girl and world are twosyllable words for some speakers the same may occur between r and m between r and n and between l and m there is a distinction between w and hw in word pairs such as witch and which the phoneme x is common in names and in sses many gaelic and scots borrowings so much so that it is often taught to incomers particularly for ch in loch some scottish speakers use it in words of greek origin as well such as technical patriarch etc wells 1982 408l is usually velarised see dark l except in borrowings like glen from scottish gaelic gleann which had an unvelarised l in their original form in areas where scottish gaelic was spoken until relatively recently such as dumfries and galloway and in areas where it is still spoken such as the west highlands  velarisation of l may be absent in many words in which it is present in other areas but remains in borrowings that had velarised l in gaelic such as loch gaelic loch and clan gaelic clannp t and k are not aspirated in more traditional varieties 17 but are weakly aspirated currently the past ending ed may be realised with t where other accents use d chiefly after unstressed vowels ended ɛndɪt carried karɪtvowel length is generally regarded as nonphonemic although a distinctive part of scottish english is the scots vowel length rule scobbie et al 1999 certain vowels such as i u and æ are generally long but are shortened before nasals and voiced plosives however this does not occur across morpheme boundaries so that crude contrasts with crewed need with kneed and side with sighed scottish english has no ʊ instead transferring scots u phonetically this vowel may be pronounced ʉ or even ʏ thus pull and pool are homophones cot and caught are not differentiated in most central scottish varieties as they are in some other varieties 18in most varieties there is no æ  ɑː distinction therefore bath trap and palm have the same vowel 18the happ y vowel is most commonly e as in face  but may also be ɪ as in kit or i as in fleece  19θs is often used in plural nouns where southern english has ðz baths youths etc  with and booth are pronounced with θ see pronunciation of english th  in colloquial speech the glottal stop may be an allophone of t after a vowel as in ˈbʌʔər these same speakers may drop the g in the suffix ing and debuccalise θ to h in certain contextsɪ may be more open ë̞ for certain speakers in some regions so that it sounds more like ɛ although ɪ and ɛ do not merge other speakers may pronounce it as ɪ just as in many other accents or with a schwalike  ə quality others may pronounce it almost as ʌ in certain environments particularly after w and hw

in northern english dialects  bonnie for pretty attractive or good looking handsome as in the case of bonnie prince charlie braw for fine muckle for big spail for splinter snib for bolt pinkie for little finger janitor for school caretaker these last two are also standard in american english  outwith meaning outside of cowp for tip or spill fankle for a tangled mess kirk for church has
