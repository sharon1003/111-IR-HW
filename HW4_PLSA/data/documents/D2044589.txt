search engine and if so what search terms did they link from another website what did they do while on your site what pages did they visit what links did they follow what information did they view did they buy anything did they subscribe to anything what page were they viewing when they left the site the information can also be aggregated to give you an overall picture of how your site is used eg how many visitorsday peak usage times what pages are most popular what path do most people take through your site many hosting services provide some measure of analytics in addition there are numerous companies that offer lowcost or free analytics services web statistics are a useful tool for measuring site usage for example using web statistics you can calculate a number of useful marketingrelevant indicators penetration  unique visitors to home page  unique visitors penetration reflects the percentage of site visitors that go beyond your organizations home page conversion  unique visitors taking desired action  unique visitors conversion reflects the percentage of site visitors that take a desired action you can measure the conversion for several actions simultaneously for example the percentage of site visitors that purchase online and the percentage of site visitors that subscribe to your organizations electronic newsletter connection  referral clickthrus  desired page views connection refers to the number of site visitors to your site from an external location such as another website or online advertisement that view desired content online promotions with a high connection rate are more effective migration  visits to content area  site exits from the content area migration refers to the number of site visitors that leave your site from a specific content area content areas with the highest migration are typically less effective than areas with lower migration clicks to action  average number of clicks from home page to desired action cta reflects the

all marketing strategy this requires an examination of your target market available technology and the rationale for the proposed strategy as it relates to alternatives cost and support requirements make sure your target market uses the internet regularly for any strategy to be effective your target market segments must contain a sufficient number of internet users the most effective internet strategies will fail if the intended target markets are not online granted with seventyseven percent of americans online this is not likely to be an issue for most market segments however not all market segments are equally represented for example internet usage is closely correlated with income and education—the higher the income and education the higher the percentage of individuals using the internet in addition nonenglish speaking individuals are considerably less likely to use the internet that englishspeakers note that demographic differences are markedly less for teenagers than for adults regardless of education income or language teens use the internet in addition to simply using the internet you want your target market to be using the internet in a way that aligns with your business objectives for your website for example 80 percent of those in gen x 3344 years old make online purchases in contrast in 2011 only 56 percent of 64 to 72 year olds use ecommerce thus if

to implement the strategy are not present within the organization for example it may be desirable for a company to sell its productsservices online however doing so requires the ability to update product information and process incoming orders in addition once implemented internet strategies may require ongoing support or thirdparty maintenance that needs to be considered explore noninternet options to achieve your objectives examine the objectives that you came up with when you were considering why you want to engage in onlineinternet marketing bump them up to a more generic statement what do you really want to achieve increased sales increased brand awareness increased customer loyalty now consider all the alternative methods of achieving the desired objectives this includes

the newsletter through free distribution in stores or libraries or you might change the content of the newsletter or its methodfrequency of distribution so that it has a wider appeal to your target market although many strategies may address a desired objective your business will need to distinguish the best strategy for a given set of circumstances after identifying the considerations for each proposed strategy summarize the benefits of this strategy in comparison with others why is the proposed internet strategy the best strategy for addressing the desired objective how will it achieve the desired goal what are the cost technology and infrastructure advantages of this strategy as compared to alternatives tools to use among the business tools are internet marketing objectives and

collect if possible from site visitors basically anything that requires programming tools to use among the business tools is an internet marketing content plan worksheet to help you define your goals when creating a content plan make sure to include what information you will need from the website and what information you will need to update for example if you anticipate adding weekly news then the functional inventory should include a means of easily addingmodifyingdeleting news from the site without requiring ongoing assistance from a web programmer or vendor the content plan provides the basis for creating an implementation plan if youre building the website yourself—or the basis for drafting a request for proposal if youll be selecting a vendor to create the website be thorough when creating the website implementation plan the website implementation plan takes your content plan to the next step and provides detailed specifications regarding scope timeline and budget the blueprint and construction specifications analogies are excellent ones to keep in mind if you are building a house you need to decide in advance if the house will have a basement or be on a slab how many bedrooms and bathrooms there will be and what type of exterior facade you want if you change any of these key decisions once the house is nearly complete the entire project will be derailed you may need be able to get the changes you want but even if you can the costs and delays will be prohibitive the same applies to website design if you dont take the time to get the requirements exactly right you will face significant cost overruns and delays your implementation should contain the following sections—specified in exacting detail overview this includes the purpose and audience information from the content plan it also provides a condensed description of the project and its general scope scope this will be the longest and most detailed section of the plan in the scope section you provide a complete description your project this includes the tasks to be completed the proposed technical approach for dynamic elements and any limitationprocess parameters inherent to the project the content summary and feature list from the content plan should be integrated into the scope of the document timeline the timelines for rolling out websites vary depending on the size of the site and the scope of the project a typical timeline includes planning design production and testing milestones timelines often need to be adjusted to reflect the workload of staff the selected vendor and related project dependencies budget while creating the implementation plan staff will provide estimates for time outside suppliers and required resources for completing the project these costs are then combined to create an overall budget to implement the project the production time needed for building your company website only reflects a portion of the overall cost typically half of the budget costs associated with planning design and testing also need to be included for an accurate budget tools to use among the business tools is an internet marketing implementation plan worksheet to help you define your goals determining who will build your website before you can develop the budget for your project you will need to conduct research on the feasibility of different website construction options the choices run the gamut from a complete doityourself project to contracting for the complete installation the diy option is more feasible if you or your employees are familiar and comfortable with technology and your functionality and customization requirements are relatively basic most hosting services have a wide selection of semicustomized templates that you can use to build and launch a website in a matter of hours without having to know any web programming languages the downside of the doityourself approach is not so much in the actual building of a basic website as it is in understanding what makes an effective website while internet usability is not the proverbial rocket science there are rules and best practices that you may not want to devote time to learning if you want to make sure that your website pays for itself in increased sales and revenue then you may want to consider having some level of professional assistance this could range from design consultation through the complete build of the website tip make sure that you investigate whether your industry or professional group provides discounts or specialized website services for example webcom partners with the national federation of independent businesses to provide free design services to members and therapy sites offers specialized websites for those in the mental health professions more complex projects may require a request for proposal if you have many specialized requirements for example international transactions or live 247 customer service then you should consider going through the request for proposal process with several different vendors a request for proposal rfp provides the basis for selecting the website developer who will implement your companys website an rfp is a version of an implementation plan that includes information requested from vendors to aid in selection selecting a vendor is a threestage process the first stage is to conduct some preliminary research on vendors and develop a short list of companies for consideration these are companies that will be asked to respond with proposals to your rfp the second stage is to prepare an rfp for those selected vendors based on the rfp vendors will provide proposals for implementing your project the final stage is to select a vendor this requires a facetoface meeting with final candidates to resolve questions about the rfp vendor proposals and final project implementation your rfp should request the following information from each company on your short list company background this includes corporate information including financial details how long has the company been in business how many employees does the company have of its employees how many are dedicated to implementing internet media capabilities in addition to capabilities associated with the rfp what other services does the vendor provide can the vendor provide representative samples of related work company qualifications how experiencedqualified is the company for the project have they completed similar projects can they provide a list of previous clients with contact information and relevant urls staffing what is the proposed team that will be working on the project what are their individual qualifications can a resume be provided for key members of the proposed team process what is the development process used by the vendor what are the project stages and milestones what are their processes for quality assurance and testing how will the completed project be delivered or implemented what documents are included as deliverables in the processes used by the vendor proposed solution how does the vendor recommend implementing the project what is their proposed technical approach what
