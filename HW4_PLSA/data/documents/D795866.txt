of melanoma skin cancer photo © national cancer institute a melanoma lesion containing different shades of brown black and tan the abcde rule can be used to help you remember what a melanoma tumor typically looks like asymmetry the shape of onehalf of the mole does not match the other border the edges are ragged notched or blurred color the color is often uneven shades of black brown and tan may be present areas of white gray red or blue may also be seen diameter the diameter is usually larger than six millimeters the size of a pencil eraser or has grown in size however melanoma can come in any size evolving the mole has been changing in size shape color appearance or growing in an area of previously normal skin also when melanoma develops in an existing mole the texture of the mole
