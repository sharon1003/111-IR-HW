talkthere was only one ship— thel vadamee one are you sure— prophet of regret yes they called it the pillar of autumn— thel vadamee explaining the battle of installation 04 to the high council 5unsc pillar of autumn  hcs c709 6 7 was a halcyon class light cruiser in the unsc navy it was informally referred to as the autumn and its name abbreviated to po a prior to the fall of reach pillar of autumn was selected to support operation red flag a spartanii operation to capture covenant leaders captain jacob keyes was placed in command the operation was forestalled by the covenant assault on reach and the cruiser was one of the few unsc survivors and fled the system having lost most of its intended spartanii passengers the cruiser was guided to the soell system by the ai cortana there it was engaged by a covenant fleet guarding installation 04 keyes crashlanded the ship on the installation where the surviving crew continued the battle against the covenant and later the flood the ships sole remaining combat effective spartanii john117 was forced to detonate pillar of autumn  s fusion reactor destroying the ship and the installation to prevent the installation from firing the pillar of autumn has a few sister ships including the unsc dawn under heaven and the unsc toulouse 8contents  showoperational history edit the pillar of autumns ship emblem construction edit the pillar of autumn was originally designed by dr robert mc lees 3 the keel was laid in 2507 1 it was constructed at the reyesmc lees shipyards on mars in 2509 as one of the thennew halcyon class cruisers 9 the ship was launched on december 1 2510 3 due to its expensive honeycomb structure the blueprints of the halcyon class were radically altered soon after the autumn  s construction with only the first eleven of fifty possessing it 10humancovenant war edit it saw action during the first battle of arcadia against the covenant in february 2531 the cruiser was heavily damaged engaging two ccs class battlecruisers 11 the cruiser contributed experimental m145d rhino to the ground fighting 12the cruiser was later decommissioned with the other halcyon class cruisers unlike its sisters in aszod the autumn was merely placed in longterm storage as military surplus just in case it should be needed later as fate had it that time came in 2550 when the unsc was desperately low on ships to defend the theater of operations around zeta doradus the site of secret oni projects and it was reactivated as an emergency support ship 10preparations for operation red flag edit main article operation red flagby 2552 it was obvious to the unsc that the war could not be ended with conventional military action a desperate plan had been conceived to end the war by capturing the covenants leadership and forcing the enemy to the negotiating table spartanii commandos would commandeer a disabled covenant ship locate the covenant homeworld and abduct the targets pillar of autumn was selected on august 25 by the ai cortana to disable an enemy ship and deliver the spartans aboard the ship was selected for the halcyon classs durability despite its classs usual lackluster offensive capabilities 13 command of the ship was given to jacob keyes a wellproven tactician and captain the cruiser received a refit for the mission adding a variety of upgrades including a stateoftheart fusion power plant 14 the refit was lead by senior engineer adam crockett 3 cortana was transferred to handle the shakedown also on board was a d77tc pelican that had been modified for the spartans selected for the mission it had double the armor plating grappling attachments and a serrated titanium ram this pelican was repurposed during the fall of reach to insert john117 linda058 and james005 into reach station gamma in order to enact cole protocol on the unsc circumference unfortunately the modified pelican was destroyed when it crashed into the station  citation neededfall of reach edit main article fall of reach pillar of autumn pushes through the covenant blockade and escapes reach pillar of autumn was prepared to deploy on august 30 however before it could depart the epsilon eridani system it was recalled to reach the unsc fleet was mustering in preparation for an imminent covenant attack on the planet cortana remained in control as the ships normally assigned ai was not yet operational the unsc hoped that an opportunity to capture an enemy ship would present itself however the course of the battle forced the spartans to deploy on other missions blue team went to reach station gamma to enforce the cole protocol while red team went planetside to reinforce the orbital defense generators while the cruiser performed well the battle was lost as the orbital defense platforms fell silent there was only time to recover the remnants of blue team john117 and the clinically dead linda058 before the ship was forced to flee the system during the space battle over reach pillar of autumn defeated a covenant supercruiser on its own that even the fleets carriers could not defeat proving pillar of autumn to be one of the most durable warships ever built by unsc navy  at some point during the conflict pillar of autumn returned to drydock at the aszod shipbreaking facility to rescue any survivors on the planet and retrieve a package shortly before the ship fled the system the remnants of noble team were tasked with delivering a fragment of cortanas data chip to pillar of autumn the ship left drydock immediately afterward it was nearly destroyed by a ccs class battlecruiser before it could take off but the cruiser was destroyed by noble six with an onager  pillar of autumn was supposed to have made a random slipspace jump in accordance with the cole protocol however cortana surreptitiously guided the ship to the soell system and ultimately to installation 04 instead the ai used coordinates obtained from a forerunner artifact on sigma octanus iv 15 the covenant pursued along the cruisers exit vector and arrived at soell first with a battle group of ccs class battlecruisers  the battle of installation 04 edit main article battle of installation 04pillar of autumn taking plasma impacts at the battle of installation 04 pillar of autumn was immediately engaged upon arriving at threshold the cruiser was spared destruction by the prophet of stewardship who feared stray plasma torpedo fire might damage installation 04 so the covenant made to board and capture the ship instead pillar of autumn destroyed four ships and damaged truth and reconciliation before boarders disabled its magnetic accelerator cannon with an antimatter charge  captain keyes ordered the crew to abandon ship john117 was given cortana for safekeeping and ordered to keep the ai out of enemy hands as part of the cole protocol the crew left the ship for the ring in whatever craft were available and the cryo pods were jettisoned keyes directed pillar of autumn on a course to crash land on the ring the covenant finally began hitting the ship with plasma torpedoes but the cruiser survived the landing reasonably intact the survivors would later transfer supplies from the ship to alpha base  the release of the flood added an unexpected dimension to the battle monitor 343 guilty spark was preparing to fire the installation in response to the outbreak in conjunction with the entire halo array this would wipe out all sentient life in the galaxy 16 john117 and cortana returned to pillar of autumn to destroy the ring by detonating the stillfunctioning fusion reactors an attempt to activate the cruisers selfdestruct from the bridge failed due to 343 guilty sparks interference the spartan was forced to manually destabilize the reactors with tactical ordnance 17pillar of autumn flying towards installation 04 the spartan and ai escaped the subsequent detonation and the ring aboard a longsword fighter still docked in launch bay 7 the effort to destroy halo with pillar of autumn succeeded sparing the galaxy from the flood and a halo activation 17legacy edit pillar of autumn would be so well known that it would have a line of cruisers that entered service after the humancovenant war the autumn class heavy cruiser named after it and the lead ship of the class unsc pillar of autumn in honor of the original pillar of autumn  design edit specifications edit pillar of autumn was roughly 43 years old at the time of its escape from reach and its later destruction on installation 04 it was a cruiser of the halcyon class the third largest in the unsc fleet at the time 9 like other halcyon ships pillar of autumn was equipped with a honeycombed internal bracing structure that allowed it to function even after sustaining critical levels of damage power plant edit the refit pillar of autumn prior to being refit for the spartan mission pillar of autumn was equipped with mark ii fusion engines which supplied only 10 the power of modern reactors 9pillar of autumn was refitted with an improved nuclear fusion engine that supported the two smaller existing reactors around a newer larger one which were capable of boosting the overall power output by 300 for a short time if needed fusion reactors generate extreme heat which must be removed in order for them to remain active without overheating the autumns overhauled reactors were an especially severe case of this usually the excess heat was conducted to a chemical agent which would then vent into space however pillar of autumn  s upgraded specifications also included an upgraded cooling system which featured a laserinduced optical slurry of ions chilled to nearabsolute zero which is far more efficient than the typical method and removed the reliance on expendable chemical temperaturecontrol substances in essence the amount of excess heat removed by the new system increased as the reactors output did this selfregulating and selfcooling power plant was critical in combat since it virtually eliminated a commanders concerns about overheating and slagging a ships engines pillar of autumn  s reactor was able to be overloaded by explosives either grenades or rockets destroying the vulnerable vent cores once these were destroyed the reactor began to go critical resulting in temperatures of over 100000000 degrees and a thermonuclear explosion large enough to tear apart a halo installation 17armament edit initially the autumn had just one regular mac gun and six archer missile pods 9 the upgraded pillar of autumn received extensive refits including several to its weapons systems eventually it was host to a very powerful armament far in excess of the original halcyon class ships one mark ii light coil  56a2d4mac 2 the mac gun fired lighter projectiles compared to most ship grade macs but these rounds worked much like shredder rounds each charge was able to fire 3 rounds with extra power capacitors and power recycling systems pillar of autumn  s mac

tactical nuclear warheads 418 m910 pointdefense guns 3 with overlapping fields of fire for point defense against single ships two of these cannons were later salvaged by the surviving humans on installation 04 and were used to defend alpha base  six m66 sentry autocannon turrets 3eight mark 33 spitfire coilgun batteries 3layout edit engine room edit pillar of autumn  s engine room was a large threedeck high chamber allowing access to the fusion engine core side passages allowed for movement from the bottom deck all the way up to the catwalks on the third the manifolds into the cores were suspended above the second deck controls on the third deck retracted these manifolds exposing a vent that led directly into the core it was using this method to expose the core via the vents that john117 ultimately destroyed the ship and installation 04 this room is the largest room in pillar of autumn with the exception of the hangar bay and the leap of faith room airlocks edit airlock 31 32
