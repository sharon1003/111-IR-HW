past p p 454strata a rock layer formed when new layers of sediment cover older ones and compress them p 454paleontology the study of fossils p 454catastrophism the principle that events in the past occurred suddenly and were caused by different mechanisms than those operating today p 454uniformitarianism the principle stating that mechanisms of change are constant over time p 454natural selection a process in which individuals that have certain inherited traits tend to survive and reproduce at higher rates than other individuals because of those traits theory of charles darwin p 456artificial selection the selective breeding of domesticated plants and animals to encourage the occurrence of desirable traits p 458use and disuse theory of jeanbaptiste de lamarck 17441829 the idea that parts of the body that are used extensively become larger and stronger while those that are not used deteriorate p 152 ap bio test prepadaptation heritable characteristics that enhance organisms ability to survive and reproduce in specific environments eg desert foxes have large ears which radiate heat arctic foxes have small ears which conserve body heat p 152 ap bio test prephomology similarity in characteristics resulting from a shared ancestry p 462homologous structures structures in different species that are similar because of common ancestry eg forelimbs of mammals that are now used for a variety of purposes such as glying in bats or swimming in whales but were present and used in a common ancestor for walking p 463 ap bio test prep p 153embryonic homologies comparison of early stages of animal development reveals many anatomical homologies in embryos that are not visible in adult organisms eg all vertebrate embryos have a postanal tail and pharyngeal pouches p 153 ap bio test prepvestigial structures remnant of a structure that may have had an important function in a species ancestors but has no clear function in the modern species eg remnants of the pelvis and leg bones are found in some snakes p 463 p 153 ap bio test prepmolecular homologies shared characteristics on the molecular level eg all lifeforms use the same genetic language of dna and rna amino acid sequences coding for hemoglobin in primate species shows great similarity thus indicating a common ancestor p 153 ap bio test prepevolutionary tree a branching diagram that reflects a hypothesis about evolutionary relationships among groups of organisms p 464convergent evolution explains why distantly related species can resemble one another convergent evolution has taken place when 2 organisms developed similarities as they adapted to similar environmental challenges  not because they evolved from a common ancestor the likenesses that result from convergent evolution are considered analogous  comparison between 2 different things rather than homologous p 464analogous similar or correspondent in some respects though otherwise dissimilar eg brains and computers are often compared p 465evidence for evolution 1 direct observations 2 the fossil record 3 homology 4 biogeography p 153 ap bio test prepbiogeography the geographic distribution of species species in a discrete geographic area tend to be more closely related to each other than to species in distant geographic areas eg in south america desert animal are more closely related to local animals in other habitats than they are to the desert animals of asis p 466 p 154 ap bio test preppangaea the supercontinent formed near the end of the paleozoic era when plate movements brought all the landmasses of earth together p 466continental drift the hypothesis that states that the continents once formed a single landmass broke up and drifted to their present locations p 154 ap bio test prependemic native to or confined to a certain region the species is found no where else in the world p 466microevolution is change in the allele frequencies of a population over generations this is evolution on its smallest scale p 469genetic variation differences among individuals in the composition of their genes or other dna segments p 470average heterozygosity the percent on average of a populations loci that are heterozygous in members of the population p 470geographic variation differences between the gene pools of geographically separate populations or population subgroups p 471mutations the only source of new genes and new alleles only mutations in cell lines that produce gametes can be passed to offspring p 155 ap bio test preppoint mutations changes in one base in a gene they can have significant impact on phenotype as in sicklecell disease p 155 ap bio test prepchromosomal mutations delete disrupt duplicate or rearrange many loci at once they are usually harmful p 155 ap bio test preppopulation genetics the study of how populations change genetically over time p 473 p 155 ap bio test preppopulation a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area and interbreed producing fertile offspring p 473 p 155 ap bio test prepgene pool all of the alleles at all loci in all the mem ers of a population in diploid species each individual has 2 alleles for a particular gene and the individual may be either heterozygous or homozygous p 473 p 155 ap bio test prephardyweinberg principle is used to describe a population that is not evolving it states that the frequencies of alleles and genes in a populations gene pool will remain constant over the course of generations unless they are acted upon by forces other the mendelian segregation and the recombination of alleles the population is at hardyweinberg equilibrium p 47475 p 156 ap bio test prepequation for hardyweinberg equation p2  2pq  q2  1 where p2 is equal to the frequency of the homozygous dominant in the population 2pq is equal to the frequency of all the heterozygotes in the population and q2 is equal to the frequency of the homozygous recessive in the population consider a gene locus that exists in 2 allelic forms a and a in a population let p  the frequency of a the dominant allele and q  the frequency of a the recessive allele so p2  aa q2  aa 2pq  aa if we know the frequency of one of the alleles we can calculate the frequency of the other allele p  q  1 so p  1q q  1p p 476 p 156 ap bio test prep5 conditions for hardyweinberg equilibrium 1 no mutations  the gene pool is modified if mutations alter alleles or if entire genes are deleted or duplicated 2 random mating  if individuals mate preferentially within a subset of the population such as their close relatives inbreeding random mixing of gametes does not occur and genotype frequencies change 3 no natural selection  differences in the survival and reproductive success of individuals carrying different genotypes can alter allele frequencies 4 extremely large population size  the smaller the population the more likely itis that allele frequencies will fluctuate by chance from one generation to the next  process is called genetic drift 5 no gene flow  by moving alleles into or out of populations gene flow can alter allele frequencies p 475genetic drift is the unpredictable fluctuation in allele frequencies from one generation to the next the smaller the population the greater the chance is for genetic drift this is a random nonadaptive change in allele frequencies p 477 p 157 ap bio test prepfounder effect a few individuals become isolated from a larger population and establish a new population whose gene pool is not reflective of the source population p 477 p 157 ap bio test prepbottleneck effect a sudden change in the environment eg an earthquake flood or fire that drastically reduces the size of a population the few survivors that pass through the restrictive bottleneck may have a gene pool that no longer reflects that original populations gene pool eg the population of california condors was reduced to 9 individuals this represents a bottlenecking event p 478 p 157 ap bio test prepgene flow occurs when a population gains or loses alleles by genetic additions to andor subtractions from the population this results from the movement of fertile individuals or gametes gene flow tends to reduce the genetic differences between populations thus making populations more similar p 479 p 157 ap bio test preprelative fitness refers to the contribution an organism makes to the gene pool of the next generation relative to the contributions of other members fitness does not indicate strength or size it is measured only by reproductive success p 480 p 158 ap bio test prepdirectional selection occurs when conditions favor individuals exhibiting one extreme of a phenotypic range thereby shifting a populations frequency curve for the phenotypic character in one direction or the other eg large black bears survived periods of extreme cold better than smaller ones and so became more common during glacial periods p 481 p 158 ap bio test prepdisruptive selection occurs when conditions favor individuals at both extremes of a phenotypic range over individuals with intermediate phenotypes eg a population has individuals with either large beaks or small beaks but few with the intermediate beak size apparently the intermediate beak size is not efficient in cracking either the large or small seeds that are common p 481 p 158 ap bio test prepstabilizing selection natural selection in which intermediate phenotypes survive or reproduce more successfully than do extreme phenotypes eg birth weights of most humans lie in a narrow range as those babies who are very large or very small have higher mortality p 481 p 158 ap bio test prepsexual selection is a form of natural selection in which individuals with certain inherited characteristics are more likely than other individuals to obtain mates it can result in sexual dimorphism  a difference between the 2 sexes in secondary sexual characteristics such as differences in size color ornamentation and behavior p 482 p 158 ap bio test prepsexual dimorphism a difference between the 2 sexes in secondary sexual characteristics such as differences in size color ornamentation and behavior p 482 p 158 ap bio test prepdiploidy one of the factors that contribute to the preservation of genetic variation in population 2 sets of chromosomes eukaryotes can hide recessive alleles p 159 ap bio test prepheterozygote advantage individuals who are heterozygous at a certain locus have an advantage for survival eg in sicklecell disease individuals homozygous for normal hemoglobin are more susceptible to malaria whereas homozygous recessive individuals suffer from the complications of sicklecell disease heterozygotes benefit from protection form malaria and dod not have sicklecell disease so the mutant allele remains relatively common p 484 p159 ap bio test prepwhy natural selection cannot produce perfect organisms selection can only edit existing variations evolution is limited by historical constraints adaptations are often compromises chance natural selection and the environment interact p 484 p 159 ap bio test prepspeciation an evolutionary process in which one species splits into two or more species p 488microevolution is change in the genetic makeup of a population from generation to generation it refers to adaptations that are confined to a single gene pool p 488macroevolution refers to evolutionary change above the species level such as the appearance of feathers and other such novelties used to define higher taxa p 488biological species concept defines a species as a population or group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed in nature and produce viable fertile offspring but are unable to produce viable fertile offspring with members of other populations p 489reproductive isolation the existence of biological factors barriers that impede members of two species from interbreeding and producing viable fertile offspring p 489hybrids offspring that result from an interspecific mating p 489prezygotic barriers a reproductive barrier that impedes mating between species or hinders fertilization if interspecific mating is attempted examples of this are habitat isolation behavioral isolation temporal isolation mechanical isolation and gametic isolation p 489490 p 160 ap bio test preppostzygotic barriers a reproductive barrier that prevent hybrid zygotes produced by two different species from developing into viable fertile adults examples of this include reduced hybrid viability reduced hybrid fertility and hybrid breakdown p 48991 p 160 ap bio test prephabitat isolation two species that occupy different habitats within the same area may encounter each other rarely if at all even though they are not isolated by obvious physical barriers such as mountain ranges an example of prezygotic barriers p 490behavioral isolation form of reproductive isolation in which two populations have differences in courtship rituals or other types of behavior that prevent them from interbreeding an example of prezygotic barriers p 490temporal isolation species may breed at different times of day different seasons or different years and this can prevent them from mating an example of prezygotic barriers p 490mechanical isolation species may be anatomically incompatible an example of prezygotic barriers p 490gametic isolation even if the gametes of 2 species do meet they might be unable to fuse to form a zygote an example of prezygotic barriers p 491reduced hybrid viability when a zygote is formed genetic incompatibility may cause development to cease an example of postzygotic barriers p 491reduced hybrid fertility even if the 2 species produce a viable offspring reproductive isolation is still occurring if the offspring is sterile and cant reproduce an example of postzygotic barriers p 491hybrid breakdown sometimes 2 species mate and produce viable fertile hybrids however when the hybrids mate their offspring are weak or sterile an example of postzygotic barriers p 491morphological species concept a definition of species in terms of measurable anatomical criteria p 492allopatric speciation a population forms a new species because it is geographically isolated from the parent population p 493sympatric speciation a small part of a population becomes a new population without being geographically separated from the parent population it can result from part of the population switching to a new habitat food source or other resource p 495geologic events or separation when a population is fragmented by the emergence of a mountain range the formation of a land bridge or evaporation in a large lake that produces several small lakes small newly isolated populations undergo allopatric speciation more frequently because they are more likely to have their gene pools significantly altered speciation is confirmed when individuals from the new population are unable to mate successfully with individuals from the parent population p 160 ap bio test preppolyploidy a chromosomal alteration in which the organism possesses more than two complete chromosome sets it is the result of an accident of cell division p 495autopolyploid an individual that has more than two chromosome sets all derived from a single species an example is the formation of autopolyploid plants through nondisjunction in meiosis these plants may have a 4n chromosome number instead of the normal 2n number and they cannot breed with diploid members and produce fertile offspring p 495adaptive radiation occurs when many new species arise from a single common ancestor adaptive radiation typically occurs when a few organisms make their way to new distant areas or when environmental changes cause numerous extinctions opening up ecological niches for the survivors p 161 ap bio test prepgradualism proposes that species descended from a common ancestor and gradually diverge more and more in morphology as they acquire unique adaptations p 161 ap bio test preppunctuated equilibrium a term used to describe periods of apparent stasis punctuated by sudden change observed in the fossil record p 502 p 161 ap bio test preporigin of life theory small organic molecules were synthesized these small molecules joined into macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids all these molecules were packaged into protocells membrane containing droplets whose internal chemistry differed from that of the external environment selfreplicating molecules emerged that made inheritance possible p 507510 p 16162 ap bio test prepprotocells droplets with membranes that maintained an internal chemistry different from that of their surroundings p 508when was earth formed 46 billion years ago and life on earth emerged about 3839 billion years ago for the first threequarters of earths history all of its living organisms were microscopic and primarily unicellular p 162 ap bio test prepoparin and haldane oparin a russian chemist and haldane  a british scientist hypothesized that the early atmosphere thick with water vapor nitrogen carbon dioxide methane ammonia hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide provided with energy from lightning and uv radiation could have formed organic compounds a primitive soup from which life arose miller and urey from the university of chicago tested this theory in 1953 and produced a variety of amino acids it is hypothesized that selfreplicating rna not dna was the first genetic material rna which plays a central role in protein synthesis can also carry out a number of enzymelike catalytic functions these rna catalysts are called ribozymes p 508 p 162 ap bio test prepfossil record is the sequence in which fossils appear in the layers of sedimentary rack that constitute earths surface fossils which may be remnants of dead organisms or impressions they left behind are most often found in sedimentary rck formed from layers of minerals settling out of water the fossil record is incomplete because it favors organisms that existed for a long time were relatively abundant and widespread and had shells or hard bony skeletons p 40809 p 162 ap bio test preppaleontologists scientists who study fossils p 510relative dating method of determining the age of a fossil by comparing its placement with that of fossils in other layers of rock p 162 ap bio test prepradiometric dating uses the decay of radioactive isotopes to determine the age of the rocks or fossils it is based on the rate of decay or halflife of the isotope p 512halflife the period of time in which half of a radioactive substance decays p 512key events in lifes history the earliest living organisms were prokaryotes about 27 billion years ago oxygen began to accumulate in earths atmosphere as a result of photosynthesis eukaryotes appeared about 21 billion years ago p 514endosymbiotic hypothesis proposes that mitochondria and plastids chloroplasts were formerly small prokaryotes that began living within larger cells p 163 ap bio test prepevidence for endosymbiotic hypothesis both organelles mitochondria and plastids have enzymes and transport systems homologous to those found in the plasma membranes of living prokaryotes both replicate by a splitting process similar to prokaryotes both contain a single circular dna molecule not associated with histone proteins both have their own ribosomes which can translate their dna into proteins p 516 p 163 ap bio test prepwhen did multicellular eukaryotes evolve about 12 billion years ago p 163 ap bio test prepcolonization of land occurred about 500 million years ago when plants fungi and animals began to appear on earth p 163 ap bio test prepcontinental drift is the movement of earths continents on great plates that float on the hot underlying mantle the san andreas fault marks where 2 plates are sliding past each other where plates have collided mountains are uplifted continental drift can help explain the disjunct geographic distribution of certain species such as a fossil freshwater reptile found in both brazil and ghana in west africa today widely separated by ocean it also explains why no eutherian placental mammals are indigenous to australia p 51920 p 163 ap bio test prepmass extinctions loss of large numbers of species in a short period have resulted from global environmental changes that have caused the rate of extinction to increase dramatically by removing large numbers of species a mass extinction can drastically alter a complex ecological community evolutionary lineages disappear forever eg the dinosaurs were lost in a nass extinction 65 million years ago p 52123 p 163 ap bio test prepadaptive radiations are periods of evolutionary change in which groups of organisms form many new species whose adaptations allow them to fill different ecological niches eg the galapagos finch species are the result of an adaptive radiation p 524 p 163 ap bio test prepplate tectonics continental plates move gradually over time altering the physical geography and climate of earth these changes lead to extinctions in some groups of organisms and bursts of speciation in others p 519what causes major changes in body form evolutionary novelty can arise when structures that originally played one role gradually acquire a different one structures that evolve in one context but become coopted for another function are sometimes called exaptation for example it is possible that feathers of modern birds were coopted for flight after functioning in some other capacity such as thermoregulation evodevo is a field of study in which evolutionary biology and developmental biology converge this field is illuminating how slight genetic divergences can be magnified into major morphological differences between species p 52526 p 163 ap bio test prepheterochrony an evolutionary change in the rate or timing of developmental events changing relative rates of growth even slightly can change the adult form of organisms substantially thus contributing to the potential for evolutionary change p 525 p 164 ap bio test prephomeotic genes are master regulatory genes that determine the location and organization of body parts p 526hox genes one class of homeotic genes changes in hox genes and in the genes that regulate them can have a profound effect on morphology thus contributing to the potential for evolutionary change an example is seen in the variable expression of a hox gene in a snake limb bud and a chicken leg bud resulting in no legs in the snake and a skeletal extension in the chicken p 526 p 164 ap bio test prepevolution is not goal oriented evolution is like tinkering  a process in which new forms arise by the slight modification of existing forms even large changes like the ones that produced the first mammals can result from the modification of existing structures or existing developmental genes p 529phylogeny the evolutionary history of a species or group of species p 536systematics a scientific discipline focused on classifying organisms and determining their evolutionary relationships its tools include fossils morphology genes and molecular evidence p 536taxonomy is an ordered division of organisms into categories based on a set of characteristics used to assess similarities and differences p 537binomial nomenclature a system to specify an organism by its genus and species every organism is given a scientific name consisting of two parts its genus and species names p 537genus a classification grouping that consists of a number of similar closely related species p 537species a population or group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed in nature and produce viable fertile offspring but do not produce viable fertile offspring with members of other such groups p g33hierarchical classification levels domain kingdom phylum class order family genus species each level is called a taxon  hint to help you remember the order king phillip climbed over the fence and got shottaxon a named taxonomic unit at any given level of classification p 537phylogenetic trees a branching diagram that represents a hypothesis about the evolutionary history of a group of organisms the branches of such trees reflect the hierarchical classifications of groups nested within more inclusive groups notice in the figure 264 that 2 branch points are numbered each number represents a common ancestor of the 2 branches p 538 fig 264homologous structures are similarities due to shared ancestry such as the cones of a whales flipper and a tigers paw p 540convergent evolution has taken place when 2 organisms developed similarities as they adapted to similar environmental challenges  not because they evolved from a common ancestor example the streamlined bodies of a tuna and a dolphin show convergent evolution the likenesses that result from convergent evolution are considered analogous rather than homologous they do not indicate relatedness but rather similar solutions to similar problems example the wing of a butterfly is analogous to the wing of a bat both are adaptations for flight p 540analogy similarity between 2 species that is due to convergent evolution rather than to descent from a common ancestor with the same trait p 540molecular systematics uses dna and other molecular data to determine evolutionary relationships the more alike the dna sequences of 2 organisms the more closely related they are evolutionarily p 54041cladogram depicts patterns of shared characteristics among taxa and forms the basis of a phylogenetic tree p 542clade within a phylogenetic tree is defined as a group of species that includes an ancestral species and all its descendants p 542shared derived characters evolutionary novelty that is unique to a particular clade example hair is a shared derived character of mammals p 543monophyletic group includes a single common ancestor and all of its descendants a monophyletic taxon is equivalent to a clade p 542 p 173 ap bio test prepparaphyletic group consists of an ancestral species and some but not all of its descendants p 542 p 173 ap bio test preppolyphyletic group pertaining to a group of taxa derived from 2 or more different ancestors p 542 p 173 ap bio test prepan organisms evolutionary history is documented in its genome the rate of evolution of dna sequences varies from one part of the genome to another therefore comparing these different sequences helps us to investigate relationships between groups of organisms that diverged a long time ago dna that codes from ribosomal rna changes relatively slowly and is useful for investigating relationships between taxa that diverged hundreds of millions of years ago dna that codes for mitochondrial dna evolves rapidly and can be used to explore recent evolutionary events p 54849molecular clocks are methods used to measure the absolute time of evolutionary change based on the observation that some genes and other regions of the genome appear to evolve at constant rates p 54950new information continues to revise our understanding of the tree of life taxonomy is in flux when the authors of this textbook were in high school they were taught there were 2 kingdoms plants and animals then in college courses they were introduced to 5 kingdoms monera protista plantae fungi and animalia now biologists have adopted a 3domain system which consists of the domains bacteria archaea and eukarya this system arose from the finding that there are 2 distinct lineages of prokaryotes the domains bacteria and archaea contain prokaryotic organisms and eukarya contains eukaryotic organisms as we gain more tools for analysis earlier ideas about evolutionary relatedness are changed and so taxonomy too continues to evolve see table on p 174 ap bio test prep p551553prokaryotic success life is divided into 3 domains archaea bacteria and eukarya both domain bacteria and domain archaea are made up of prokaryotes the most common shapes of prokarytes are spheres rods and helices most are about 15 um in size this is perhaps 110 the size of a typical eukaryotic cell study figure 73 p 174 ap bio test prep prokaryotes have no true nuclei or internal compartmentalization the dna is concentrated in a nucleoid region and has little associated protein the small genome consists of a single circular chromosome prokaryotes reproduce through an asexual process called binary fission and have short generation times in addition to their one major chromosome prokaryotic cells may also possess smaller circular selfreplicating pieces of dna called plasmids outside their cell membranes most prokaryotes possess a cell wall that contains peptidoglycans grampositive bacteria have simpler walls with more peptidoglycans whereas gramnegative cells have walls that are structurally more complex prokaryotes use appendages called pili that adhere to each other or to surrounding surfaces about half of the prokaryotes are motile because they possess whiplike flagella p 55657 p 17475 ap bio test preppeptidoglycan a type of polymer in bacterial cell walls consisting of modified sugars crosslinked by short polypeptides p 557gram stain a staining method that distinguishes between two different kinds of bacterial cell walls may be used to help determine medical response to an infection p 557gramnegative describing the group of bacteria that have a cell wall that is structurally more complex and contains less peptidoglycan than the cell wall of grampositive bacteria gramnegative bacteria are often more toxic than grampositive bacteria p 557grampositive describing the group of bacteria that have a cell wall that is structurally less complex and contains more peptidoglycan than the cell wall of gramnegative bacteria grampositive bacteria are usually less toxic than gramnegative bacteria p 557capsule in many prokaryotes a dense and welldefined layer of polysaccharide or protein that surrounds the cell wall and is sticky protecting the cell and enabling it to adhere to substrates or other cells p 558fimbriae a short hairlike appendage of a prokaryotic cell that helps it adhere to the substrate or to other cells p 558pili short hairlike protein structures on the surface of some bacteria appendages that allow bacteria to attach to each other and to transfer dna p 5583 mechanisms by which bacteria can transfer genetic material transformation transduction and conjugation p 562transformation a mechanism in which a prokaryote takes up dna from its environment p 562transduction a mechanism in which viruses transfer genes between prokaryotes p 562conjugation mechanism in which genes are directly transfered from one prokaryote to another as they are temporarily joined by a mating bridge p 562mutation is the major source of genetic variation in prokaryotes p 175 ap bio test prep
