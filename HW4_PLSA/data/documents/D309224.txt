later sort in sequential order the components of the intrinsic conduction system beginning at the sa node are  av node av bundle bundle branches purkinje fibers the function of the intrinsic conduction system is to  insure that the heart beats in a sequential and coordinated manner the electrocardiogram ecgekg shows a record of  electrical excitation of the heart the qrs complex is associated with  depolarization of the ventricles a normal qt interval is  031041 sec when heart rate is 70 beatsmin if the av node is damaged so that it can no longer transmit the signal from the sa node total heart block will the ventricles continue to contract why or why not yes however ventricular contractions will no longer follow atrial contractions and the rate of ventricular contractions will be significantly slowed how does holding the breath affect heart rate heart rate decreases during exercise the heart rate  increases proportional to the exertion involved bradycardia describes a heart rate of  less than 60 beatsmin ventricular fibrillation is  rapid uncoordinated ventricular contractions arteries and veins are constructed of  tunics 3the tunica media consists of  smooth muscle and elastic fibers the cerebral arterial circle circle of willis  is an example of an anastomosis lies at the base of the brain and may provide an alternative set of pathways for blood to reach brain tissue two pairs of arteries supply the brain they are  vertebrals and internal carotids the subclavian artery that arises directly from the aorta supplies the  left upper extremity and neck bronchial arteries that supply oxygenated blood to the lungs and bronchi arise from the  thoracic aorta the aorta terminates when it divides into the  common iliac arteries these veins drain the brain internal jugular veins the inferior vena cava drains the  abdomen and lower extremities the external iliac vein  receives venous blood from the lower extremity blood vessels that absorb strong pressure pulses contain more of this type of tissue elastic in a microscopic field showing an artery and its corresponding vein you can easily distinguish the two because  veins have thinner walls and are irregular in shape there are two brachiocephalic veins and  brachiocephalic artery or arteries 1these arteries supply the intercostal muscles spinal cord and vertebrae posterior intercostals in correct sequence from superior to inferior the three single arteries that arise from the abdominal aorta are  celiac trunk superior mesenteric inferior mesenteric this artery of the foot is often palpated to assess the circulatory efficiency of the limb as a whole dorsalis pedis artery these veins drain the thigh femoral arteries that supply the intestines arise from the aorta veins that drain the intestines  ultimately drain into the hepatic portal vein which of the following veins drain the brain internal jugular in the fetus which blood vessel s carries carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes from the fetus to the placenta umbilical arteries a woman in her early 50s appeared at a walkin clinic complaining of aching pain in her right leg following a fall visual examination revealed that the medial aspect of that leg was red and swollen a diagnosis of phlebitis was made what is phlebitis and what more serious condition may result if proper healing does not occur phlebitis is an inflammation of a vein accompanied by painful throbbing and redness of the skin over the inflamed vessel thrombophlebitis can result if proper healing does not occur t or f the outermost layer of a

arterial pressure mrs gray a 50yearold mother of seven children is complaining of dull aching pains in her legs she reports that the pain has been getting progressively worse since the birth of her last child during her physical examination numerous varicosities are seen in both legs what pathologic changes have occurred in these veins the veins have become tortuous and dilated because of incompetent valves that allow the blood to pool stretching the vein walls a pregnant patient comes into a clinic and asks about a small dark bulge that is becoming more apparent on her leg what is it and what caused it a varicose vein the growing fetus puts downward pressure on the vessels of the groin and restricts the return of blood to the heart causing the valves in the peripheral veins to

baroreceptors would result in which of the following an increase in heart contractility what would be the effect of a high salt diet on blood pressure what is the physiological basis for your answer increased blood pressure this is due to increased sodium in the blood increasing the total extracellular fluid volume how would a blow to the head that damages disables the vasomotor center affect blood pressure what is the physiological basis for your answer damage to the vasomotor center will cause a loss of vasomotor tone and a drop in blood pressure because the vasomotor center is the integrating center for blood pressure control how would an attack by a mugger effect blood pressure what is the physiological basis for your answer blood pressure would increase due to sympathetic nervous system stimulation how would a hypothalamic tumor resulting in excess adh production affect blood pressure what is the physiological basis for your answer excess adh production would cause an increase in blood pressure through increased water retention and therefore increased blood volume adh also stimulates vasoconstriction mr wilson is a 45yearold stockbroker with essential hypertension he is african american obese and he smokes 23 packs of cigarettes daily what risk factors for hypertension are typified by mr wilson what complications are likely if corrective steps are not taken the risk factors are obesity race a highstress job and smoking complications could include atherosclerosis heart failure renal failure and stroke a patient lost a lot of blood during surgery and his blood pressure dropped from 12080 to 9050 how did the kidneys respond to this change in blood pressure aldosterone and adh release is triggered aldosterone causes increased sodium absorption and adh causes increased water absorption increasing blood volume and blood pressure t or f the adjustment of blood flow to each tissue in proportion to its requirements at any point in time is termed autoregulation truet or f osmotic pressure is created by the presence in a fluid of small diffusible molecules that easily move through the capillary membrane falset or f every minute about 15 ml of fluid leaks out

choices below does not involve tissue perfusion gas exchange in the lungs absorption of nutrients from the digestive tract delivery of oxygen and nutrients to and removal of wastes from tissue cells blood clottingthe velocity of blood flow is  slowest in the capillaries because the total crosssectional area is the greatest cerebral blood flow is regulated by  intrinsic autoregulatory mechanisms where in the body would you find low oxygen levels causing vasoconstriction and high levels causing vasodilation lungs if blood pressure is almost normal in a person who has lost blood does that mean the tissues are receiving adequate blood flow not necessarily the most common form of shock is  hypovolemic a family of peptides called  are released by the endothelium and are among the most potent vasoconstrictors known endothelins shock is due to abnormal expansion of blood vessels and a rapid drop in blood pressure vascular which of the following would be a result of anaphylaxis a systemic allergic reaction vascular shock blood from the lower limbs is returned to the heart via the inferior vena cava the inferior vena cava carries blood  the  of the heart to right atrium substances

maintain cardiac output what are the smallest blood vessels in the body capillaries bulk fluid movement across capillary walls is typically through what structures intercellular clefts net positive hydrostatic pressure tends to move fluid out of capillaries the resulting bulk fluid movement is known as  filtration net positive osmotic pressure tends to move fluid into capillaries the resulting bulk fluid movement is known as  reabsorption near the arteriole end of a capillary what is the relationship between net hydrostatic pressure and net osmotic pressure net hydrostatic pressure is greater than net osmotic pressure how do net hydrostatic pressure and net osmotic pressure each change along the length of a capillary from arteriole to venule net osmotic pressure stays about the same and net hydrostatic pressure decreases which of the following most accurately describes how net filtration pressure nfp affects bulk fluid flow across capillary walls positive nfp causes
