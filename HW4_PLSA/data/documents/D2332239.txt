overview« hide more detailed introduction the gaba a receptor is a ligandgated ion channel of the cysloop family that includes the nicotinic acetylcholine 5ht 3 and strychninesensitive glycine receptors gaba a receptormediated inhibition within the cns occurs by fast synaptic transmission sustained tonic inhibition and temporally intermediate events that have been termed ‘gaba a slow’  10  gaba a receptors exist as pentamers of 4tm subunits that form an intrinsic anion selective channel sequences of six α three β three γ one δ three ρ one ε one π and one θ gaba a receptor subunits have been reported in mammals  4041 48 50  the πsubunit is restricted to reproductive tissue alternatively spliced versions of many subunits exist eg α4 and α6 both not functional α5 β2 β3 and γ2 along with rna editing of the α3 subunit  13  the three ρsubunits ρ13 function as either homo or heterooligomeric assemblies  11 63  receptors formed from ρsubunits because of their distinctive pharmacology that includes insensitivity to bicuculline benzodiazepines and barbiturates have sometimes been termed gaba c receptors  63  but they are classified as gaba a receptors by nciuphar on the basis of structural and functional criteria  4 4041 many gaba a receptor subtypes contain α β and γsubunits with the likely stoichiometry 2α2β1γ  30 40  it is thought that the majority of gaba a receptors harbour a single type of α and β subunit variant the α1β2γ2 heterooligomer constitutes the largest population of gaba a receptors in the cns followed by the α2β3γ2 and α3β3γ2 isoforms receptors that incorporate the α4 α5or α6subunit or the β1 γ1 γ3 δ ε and θsubunits are less numerous but they may nonetheless serve important functions for example extrasynaptically located receptors that contain α6 and δsubunits in cerebellar granule cells or an α4 and δsubunit in dentate gyrus granule cells and thalamic neurones mediate a tonic current that is important for neuronal excitability in response to ambient concentrations of gaba  5 14 36 46 52  gaba binding occurs at the βα subunit interface and the homologous γα subunits interface creates the benzodiazepine site a second site for benzodiazepine binding has recently been postulated to occur at the αβ interface   43  reviewed by  49  the particular αand γsubunit isoforms exhibit marked effects on recognition andor efficacy at the benzodiazepine site thus receptors incorporating either α4 or α6subunits are not recognised by ‘classical’ benzodiazepines such as flunitrazepam but see  61  the trafficking cell surface expression internalisation and function of gaba a receptors and their subunits are discussed in detail in several recent reviews  12 24 35 58 but one point worthy of note is that receptors incorporating the γ2 subunit except when associated with α5 cluster at the postsynaptic membrane but may distribute dynamically between synaptic and extrasynaptic locations whereas as those incorporating the d subunit appear to be exclusively extrasynaptic nciuphar  4 40 class the gaba a receptors according to their subunit structure pharmacology and receptor function currently eleven native gaba a receptors are classed as conclusively identified  ie  α1β2γ2 α1βγ2 α3βγ2 α4βγ2 α4β2δ α4β3δ α5βγ2 α6βγ2 α6β2δ α6β3δ and ρ with further receptor isoforms occurring with high probability or only tentatively  4041  it is beyond the scope of this guide to discuss the pharmacology of individual gaba a receptor isoforms in detail such information can be gleaned in the reviews  4 17 25 30 32 37 4041 48 and  23  agents that discriminate between αsubunit isoforms are noted in the table and additional agents that demonstrate selectivity between receptor isoforms for example via βsubunit selectivity are indicated in the text below the distinctive agonist and antagonist pharmacology of ρ receptors is summarised in the table and additional aspects are reviewed in  11 26 38 63
