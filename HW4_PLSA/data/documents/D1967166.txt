most recent answer 10222007q which is hotter white fire or blue fire  angela mc cullough age 14 yumaazusaa angela this is a great question as you suggest the color of an object can tell us something about its temperature it turns out that an object which is at a fixed temperature will give off light over quite a broad range of wavelengths the center or average of these wavelengths are related to the temperature if you heat a piece of steel until it looks white it is quite hot the wavelengths of the light that this piece of steel gives off range from red to blue which when mixed together look white to our eyes if something is even hotter than this so hot that it looks blue to our eyes it means that the wavelengths of the light that this object gives off probably range from blue up through the ultraviolet uv since our eyes cant see uv light it just looks blue to us so unless something else is going on an object that looks blue probably has a higher temperature than something that looks white having said this you should realize that this may not always be true some chemicals burn with a blue color for example so that if you burn some of these on an ordinary fire it will look blue for a while some fireplace logs may do this this does not mean that the temperature of the whole fire went up just that these chemicals made the color change mats published on 10222007followup on this answer
