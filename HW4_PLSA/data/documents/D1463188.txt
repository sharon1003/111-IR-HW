the endangered species list 2013 top 10 most endangered animals1 ivorybilled woodpecker this exquisite but elusive bird was said to be extinct in 2004 but some miraculous sightings in florida and arkansas have confirmed the ivorybilled woodpecker to be alive and well but the danger of extinction still looms overhead due to habitat loss and overhunting2 amur leopard panthera pardus orientalis is a very rare subspecies of leopard that only lives in the chilly forests of primorye a region in eastern russia its former habitat included parts of korea and northern china but in those areas this majestic feline has gone extinct a census count in 2007 shows that only 1420 adult leopards live with only 56 cubs this is due to poaching global warming and habitat loss caused by logging road construction and development3 javan rhinoceros rhinoceros sondaicus is the most endangered species of rhinoceros in the world there are roughly 4060 rhinos left in on java indonesia the last of the population left in cat tien national paek vietnam was killed by poachers in 2011 this rhinoceros used to populate southeast asia and indonesia but has been hunted for its supposedly magical horn although protected its current population may be too small to be able to repopulate4 northern sportive lemur there are about 100 species of lemurs on madagascar with all the species dying out fast due to logging and poaching several lemur species are listed as critically endangered by iucn international union for the conservation of nature lepilemur septentrionalis currently lives on a mountain in northern madagascar the northern sportive lemur is tiny weighing under two pounds despite its small size it has great night vision but even with its natural defenses this lemur might not last long there may be less than 20 still alive5 northern right whale eubalena glacialis is the world’s most endangered whale with only about 350 whales remaining during the 1800s hunters thought this was the “right”whale to hunt because when the whale dies it floats making it easier to bring back to shore thus the name but even though this species is now protected its numbers are dwindling whales get caught in fishing gear and the accessibility of krill which is what the whales feed on has been affected due to global climate change these two threats combined are lethal to whales6 western lowland gorilla gorilla gorilla is the most numerous subspecies of gorilla but is listed as critically endangered due to the fact that its population has declined by 60 over 25 years with projected results of further decline the cause for this steep drop in population is habitat loss poachers and the ebola virus which is an incurable disease7 leatherback sea turtle demochelys coriacea is the largest turtle on earth with the largest range swimming from the tropics to the subpolar regions but according to iucn in 1984 there were about 115000 female turtles fourteen years later there are only about 2000030000 with only more trouble ahead problems include egg theft poaching beach development and erosion caused by global climate change leatherbacks sometimes die after eating plastic found floating in the ocean which is mistaken for prey like jellyfish8 siberian or amur tiger panthera tigris altaica is the largest feline in the world weighing up to 660 pounds unlike most jungledwelling tiger subspecies this tiger lives in forests of russia’s chilly far east this cat thrives in the winter cold which often plummets to50°f due to persistent poaching the tiger population dropped down to 40 different tigers ever since this species has been protected its numbers skyrocketing up to the 500s nevertheless it still is vulnerable to illegal hunting logging and development9 chinese giant salamander andrias davidianas is the world’s biggest amphibian growing to be as long as six feet it was formerly common in china where it lives in forested streams sheltered by hills it lays 500 eggs at a time in underwater burrows where the male salamander guards the eggs but the unique chinese giant salamander has almost vanished do to its overexploitation as a food source10 the little dodo bird the little dodo bird has several nicknames such as the toothbilled pigeon and the manumea bird although just a foot long this bird is actually a relative of the famous “large” dodo bird which lived in mauritius until it was hunted to extinction about 400 years ago extinction also threatens the little dodo bird only about 100 remain and they are dying out fast due to habitat loss and illegal hunting but dont ever forget that there are other animals that are in need of our help the pandas of asia the lemurs of madagascar and the koalas and kangaroos of the australian outback are very few of many critically or even slightly endangered species and even if we almost never see marine creatures they also need our aid the yangtze river dolphin is nearly extinct and thats mainly due to the fact that china has some very polluted water so cmon people lets do something about thatsource httpwwwallaboutwildlifecomtenmostendangeredanimals endangered species list top 10 endangered plants groups trying
