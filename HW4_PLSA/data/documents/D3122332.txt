snus kills says swedish study by news staff  november 13th 2007 0706 pm  print  email tweet news staff a new study from the karolinska institutet states that consumers of swedish moist snuff – a smokeless tobacco called snus – run a higher risk of dying from cardiac arrest and stroke snus also increases the risk of high blood pressure a known factor of cardiovascular disease the use of snus has increased markedly in sweden in the past few decades so much so that it now accounts for half of all tobacco consumption in the country over 20 per cent of men between the ages of 18 and 79 are daily users consumers of snus absorb as much nicotine as smokers but are spared many of the toxic chemicals that are formed on smoking although snus does not seem to increase the risk of myocardial infarction one of the studies reported on in this doctoral thesis shows that its consumers run a 30 per cent approximately higher risk of fatal heart attack than people who have never used the product this greater risk is even higher for those who take more than 50 grams of snus a day amongst those who suffer nonfatal heart attacks users of snus have a higher fatality rate in general than nonusers and from cardiovascular diseases in particular the studies reveal no greater risk of stroke amongst users of snus however users were more likely to suffer a fatal stroke users also ran a higher risk of developing high blood pressure which is a known factor of cardiovascular disease two major population studies were used for the research now published the first comprised swedish men between the ages of 45 and 70 living in the counties of stockholm or västernorrland between 1992 and 1994 a total of 1432 men diagnosed with firstepisode myocardial infarction were compared in terms of tobacco habits and other factors with a coeval group of men from the same regions without heart problems the second was a study using data from health checks of all workers in the building industry between the years of 1978 and 93 information recorded at these checks included tobacco habits and blood pressure episodes of nonfatal and fatal myocardial infarction and stroke as well as blood pressure readings for over 100000 snus users and nonusers were then plotted up to 20034 using national health records in both population studies the analyses were confined to nonsmokers as smoking is strongly associated with the use of snus and cardiovascular disease thesis swedish moist snuff and the risk of cardiovascular diseases by mariapia hergens department of environmental medicine karolinska institutet 2007news articles more articles no losing your money does not increase risk of death another day another raw milk listeria crisis fda asks public to pressure facebook and twitter to stop seliing illegal opioid ads all articles about news releases from all over the world right to you view profile related articles use of swedish snus is linked to a doubled risk of pancreatic cancer does aspirin only prevent heart attacks in men in landmark phase iii headtohead study prasugrel statistically superior to clopidogrel in reducing risk of heart attack efient® prasugrel showed significant 26 percent reduction in cardiovascular events over clopidogrel in new core clinical cohort population subanalysis of the tritontimi 38 pivotal study atrial fibrillation found to be common in patients with atherothrombosis increases risk of cardiovascular death heart attack and stroke
