the reception starting under the beautiful jamaican sunset and growing into a romantic candlelight evening winter months sunset is around 530 pm so schedule your ceremony for 500 pm summer months sunset is around 630 but as jamaican law requires that marriages take place before 600 pm schedule your ceremony for no later than 530 pmwedding planning and coordination if you plan only a simple ceremony you may not need a coordinator if you plan a larger wedding a coordinator is indispensable for example if you want music from a dj or a live calypso band outside catering a photographervideographer or a rehearsal dinner and full reception there is no alternative please ask our agents for the telephone numbers of experienced wedding coordinators who reside in jamaica each will quote you a fee and costs for all you request based on the details of your individual wedding reception holding your wedding at a villa keeps reception costs down  whether you want a small wedding or a seated dinner or poolside buffet your wedding coordinator will suggest various options from fingerfood to an elaborate seated dinner for large groups  more than the maximum occupancy of the main villa  we require that you employ an outside caterer for food and beverage the wedding cake the traditional jamaican wedding cake is dark and rich like a christmas pudding made with dried fruits such as prunes raisins dates currants cherries etc these fruits are finely chopped and marinated in wine and rum for weeks this wonderful blend forms the base of your cake mixture a crisp white frosting and fresh flowers complete the picture your cake can have one two or three tiers leftovers will last traditionally small pieces of the cake would be mailed in little boxes to friends and relatives who could not attend the wedding and the top tier of the cake would be packed away and kept for use as the first childâ€™s christening cake the cost of the jamaican wedding cake will depend on how many guests you wish to serve a traditional american tiered wedding cake can be ordered from a bakery or you can submit your own design for our pastry chef to create price varies with design and the number of guests you want to serve another option is simply to ask your villa cook to prepare and decorate a sponge cake flowers for specific blossoms for corsages boutonnieres bouquets
