vy canis majoris vy canis majoris vy cma is currently the largest known star and also one of the most luminous located in the constellation canis major it is a red hypergiant between 1800 and 2100 solar radii 84–98 astronomical units in radius 3063 billion km or 17 billion miles in diameter and about 15 kiloparsecs 4900 light years 46×1016 km or 29×1016 mi distant from earth unlike most hypergiant stars which occur in either binary or multiple star systems vy cma is a single star it is categorized as a semiregular variable and has an estimated period of 2000 days it has an average density of 0000005 to 0000010 kgm3 placed in our solar system vy canis majoriss surface would extend beyond the orbit of saturn although the astrophysicists philip massey emily levesque and bertrand plez disagree about the stars stated radius suggesting it is smaller merely 600 times the size of the sun extending past the orbit of mars the first known recorded observation of vy canis majoris is in the star catalogue of jérôme lalande on march 7 1801 which lists vy cma as a 7th magnitude star further 19thcentury studies of its apparent magnitude demonstrate that the star has been fading since 1850 university of minnesota professor roberta m humphreys estimates the radius of vy cma at 1800 to 2100 solar radii to illustrate if earths sun were replaced by vy canis majoris its radius might extend beyond the orbit of saturn about 9 au assuming the upper size limit of 2100 solar radii light would take more than 27 hours to travel around the stars circumference compared to 145 seconds for the sun it would take 7×1015 earths to fill the volume of vy canis majoris if the earth were to be represented by a sphere one centimeter 039 in diameter the sun would be represented as a sphere with a diameter of 109 centimeters 3½ ft at a distance of 117 meters at these scales vy canis majoris would have a diameter of approximately 23 kilometers 143 mi  assuming the upper limit estimate of its radius the star has been discovered to be very unstable having thrown off much of its mass into its surrounding nebula astronomers with the help of the hubble space telescope have predicted that vy canis majoris will be blown up as a hypernova in less than 100000 years theoretically a hypernova would cause gamma ray bursts that could damage the contents of nearby solar systems 25 lightyears but vy canis majoris is much too far away for its explosion to affect earth in any way  read the rest of this articlestar size comparison your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  248
