from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from type onavigation search for other uses see blood type disambiguation type o redirects here it is not to be confused with type 0 blood type or blood group is determined in part by the abo blood group antigens present on red blood cells a blood type also called a blood group is a classification of blood based on the presence and absence of antibodies and also based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells rbcs these antigens may be proteins carbohydrates glycoproteins or glycolipids depending on the blood group system some of these antigens are also present on the surface of other types of cells of various tissues several of these red blood cell surface antigens can stem from one allele or an alternative version of a gene and collectively form a blood group system 1 blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both parents a total of 35 human blood group systems are now recognized by the international society of blood transfusion isbt 2 the two most important ones are abo and the rh d antigen they determine someones blood type a b ab and o with  − or null

on the surface of red blood cells and an individuals blood type is one of many possible combinations of bloodgroup antigens 3 across the 35 blood groups over 600 different bloodgroup antigens have been found 4 almost always an individual has the same blood group for life but very rarely an individuals blood type changes through addition or suppression of an antigen in infection malignancy or autoimmune disease 5 6 7 8 another more common cause in blood type change is a bone marrow transplant bonemarrow transplants are performed for many leukemias and lymphomas among other diseases if a person receives bone marrow from someone who is a different abo type eg a type a patient receives a type o bone marrow the patients blood type will eventually convert to the donors type some blood types are associated with inheritance of other diseases for example the kell antigen is sometimes associated with mc leod syndrome 9 certain blood types may affect susceptibility to infections an example being the resistance to specific malaria species seen in individuals lacking the duffy antigen 10 the duffy antigen presumably as a result of natural selection is less common in ethnic groups from areas with a high incidence of malaria 11abo blood group system  editabo blood group system diagram showing the carbohydrate chains that determine the abo blood group main article abo blood group system in human blood there are two antigens and antibodies the two antigens are antigen a and antigen b the two antibodies are antibody a and antibody b the antigens are present on the red blood cells and the antibodies in the serum regarding the antigen property of the blood all human beings can be classified into 4 groups those with antigen a group a those with antigen b group b those with both antigen a and b group ab and those with neither antigen group o the antibodies present together with the antigens are found as follows1 antigen a with antibody b 2 antigen b with antibody a 3 antigen ab has no antibodies 4 antigen nil group o with antibody a and b there is an agglutination reaction between similar antigen and antibody for example antigen a agglutinates the antibody a and antigen b agglutinates the antibody b thus transfusion can be considered safe as long as the serum of the recipient does not contain antibodies for the blood cell antigens of the donor the abo system is the most important bloodgroup system in humanblood transfusion the associated antia and antib antibodies are usually immunoglobulin m abbreviated ig m antibodies abo ig m antibodies are produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food bacteria and viruses  citation needed the original terminology used by karl landsteiner in 1901 for the classification was abc in later publications c became o 12 o is often called 0  zero or null in other languages 12 13phenotype genotype a aa or aob bb or boab abo oorh blood group system  editmain article rh blood group system the rh system rh meaning rhesus is the second most significant bloodgroup system in humanblood transfusion with currently 50 antigens the most significant rh antigen is the d antigen because it is the most likely to provoke an immune system response of the five main rh antigens it is common for dnegative individuals not to have any antid ig g or ig m antibodies because antid antibodies are not usually produced by sensitization against environmental substances however dnegative individuals can produce ig g antid antibodies following a sensitizing event possibly a fetomaternal transfusion of blood from a fetus in pregnancy or occasionally a blood transfusion with d positive rbcs 14 rh disease can develop in these cases 15 rh negative blood types are much less common in asian populations 03 than they are in european populations 15 16 the presence or absence of the rh d antigen is signified by the  or − sign so that for example the a− group is abo type a and does not have the rh d antigen abo and rh distribution by country  editmain article blood type distribution by country as with many other genetic traits the distribution of abo and rh blood groups varies significantly between populations other blood group systems  editmain article human blood group systems thirtythree bloodgroup systems have been identified by the international society for blood transfusion in addition to the common abo and rh systems 17 thus in addition to the abo antigens and rh antigens many other antigens are expressed on the rbc surface membrane for example an individual can be ab d positive and at the same time m and n positive  mns system  k positive  kell system  le a or le b negative  lewis system  and so on being positive or negative for each blood group system antigen many of the blood group systems were named after the patients in whom the corresponding antibodies were initially encountered clinical significance  editblood transfusion  editmain article blood transfusion transfusion medicine is a specialized branch of hematology that is concerned with the study of blood groups along with the work of a blood bank to provide a transfusion service for blood and other blood products across the world blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor licensed physician or surgeon in a similar way as medicines main symptoms of acute hemolytic reaction due to blood type mismatch 18 19much of the routine work of a blood bank involves testing blood from both donors and recipients to ensure that every individual recipient is given blood that is compatible and is as safe as possible if a unit of incompatible blood is transfused between a donor and recipient a severe acute hemolytic reaction with hemolysis rbc destruction renal failure and shock is likely to occur and death is a possibility antibodies can be highly active and can attack rbcs and bind components of the complement system to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood patients should ideally receive their own blood or typespecific blood products to minimize the chance of a transfusion reaction risks can be further reduced by crossmatching blood but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency crossmatching involves mixing a sample of the recipients serum with a sample of the donors red blood cells and checking if the mixture agglutinates or forms clumps if agglutination is not obvious by direct vision blood bank technicians usually check for agglutination with a microscope if agglutination occurs that particular donors blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient in a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified so labelling has been standardized using a barcode system known as isbt 128 the blood group may be included on identification tags or on tattoos worn by military personnel in case they should need an emergency blood transfusion frontline german waffenss had blood group tattoos during world war ii rare blood types can cause supply problems for blood banks and hospitals for example duffy negative blood occurs much more frequently in people of african origin 20 and the rarity of this blood type in the rest of the population can result in a shortage of duffynegative blood for these patients similarly for rh d negative people there is a risk associated with travelling to parts of the world where supplies of rh d negative blood are rare particularly east asia where blood services may endeavor to encourage westerners to donate blood 21hemolytic disease of the newborn hdn  editmain article hemolytic disease of the newborn pregnant women may carry a fetus with a blood type which is different from their own in those cases the mother can make ig g blood group antibodies this can happen if some of the fetus blood cells pass into the mothers blood circulation eg a small fetomaternal hemorrhage at the time of childbirth or obstetric intervention or sometimes after a therapeutic blood transfusion this can cause rh disease or other forms of hemolytic disease of the newborn hdn in the current pregnancy andor subsequent pregnancies sometimes this is lethal for the fetus in these cases it is called hydrops fetalis 22 if a pregnant woman is known to have antid antibodies the rh blood type of a fetus can be tested by analysis of fetal dna in maternal plasma to assess the risk to the fetus of rh disease 23 one of the major advances of twentieth century medicine was to prevent this disease by stopping the formation of antid antibodies by d negative mothers with an injectable medication called rho d immune globulin 24 25 antibodies associated with some blood groups can cause severe hdn others can only cause mild hdn and others are not known to cause hdn 22blood products  editto provide maximum benefit from each blood donation and to extend shelflife blood banks fractionate some whole blood into several products the most common of these products are packed rbcs plasma platelets cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma ffp ffp is quickfrozen to retain the labile clotting factors v and viii which are usually administered to patients who have a potentially fatal clotting problem caused by a condition such as advanced liver disease overdose of anticoagulant or disseminated intravascular coagulation dic units of packed red cells are made by removing as much of the plasma as possible from whole blood units clotting factors synthesized by modern recombinant methods are now in routine clinical use for hemophilia as the risks of infection transmission that occur with pooled blood products are avoided red blood cell compatibility  editblood group ab individuals have both a and b antigens on the surface of their rbcs and their blood plasma does not contain any antibodies against either a or b antigen therefore an individual with type ab blood can receive blood from any group with ab being preferable but cannot donate blood to any group other than ab they are known as universal recipients blood group a individuals have the a antigen on the surface of their rbcs and blood serum containing ig m antibodies against the b antigen therefore a group a individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups a or o with a being preferable and can donate blood to individuals with type a or ab blood group b individuals have the b antigen on the surface of their rbcs and blood serum containing ig m antibodies against the a antigen therefore a group b individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups b or o with b being preferable and can donate blood to individuals with type b or ab blood group o or blood group zero in some countries individuals do not have either a or b antigens on the surface of their rbcs and their blood serum contains ig m antia and antib antibodies therefore a group o individual can receive blood only from a group o individual but can donate blood to individuals of any abo blood group ie a b o or ab if a patient in a hospital situation needs a blood transfusion in an emergency and if the time taken to process the recipients blood would cause a detrimental delay o negative blood can be issued because it is compatible with anyone o negative blood is often overused and consequently is always in short supply 26 according to the american association of blood banks and the british chief medical officer’s national blood transfusion committee the use of group o rh d negative red cells should be restricted to persons with o negative blood women who might be pregnant and emergency cases in which bloodgroup testing is genuinely impracticable 26red blood cell compatibility chart in addition to donating to the same blood group type o blood donors can give to a b and ab blood donors of types a and b can give to ab red blood cell compatibility table 27 28recipient 1donor 1o− o a− a b− b ab− abo−oa−ab−bab−abtable note 1 assumes absence of atypical antibodies that would cause an incompatibility between donor and recipient blood as is usual for blood selected by cross matching an rh dnegative patient who does not have any antid antibodies never being previously sensitized to dpositive rbcs can receive a transfusion of dpositive blood once but this would cause sensitization to the d antigen and a female patient would become at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn if a dnegative patient has developed antid antibodies a subsequent exposure to dpositive blood would lead to a potentially dangerous transfusion reaction rh dpositive blood should never be given to dnegative women of child bearing age or to patients with d antibodies so blood banks must conserve rhnegative blood for these patients in extreme circumstances such as for a major bleed when stocks of dnegative blood units are very low at the blood bank dpositive blood might be given to dnegative females above childbearing age or to rhnegative males providing that they did not have antid antibodies to conserve dnegative blood stock in the blood bank the converse is not true rh dpositive patients do not react to d negative blood this same matching is done for other antigens of the rh system as c c e and e and for other blood group systems with a known risk for immunization such as the kell system in particular for females of childbearing age or patients with known need for many transfusions plasma compatibility  editplasma compatibility chart in addition to donating to the same blood group plasma from type ab can be given to a b and o plasma from types a b and ab can be given to o blood plasma compatibility is the inverse of red blood cell compatibility 29 type ab plasma carries neither antia nor antib antibodies and can be transfused to individuals of any blood group but type ab patients can only receive type ab plasma type o carries both antibodies so individuals of blood group o can receive plasma from any blood group but type o plasma can be used only by type o recipients plasma compatibility table 28recipient donor 1o a b aboababtable note 1 assumes absence of strong atypical antibodies in donor plasma rh d antibodies are uncommon so generally neither d negative nor d positive blood contain antid antibodies if a potential donor is found to have antid antibodies or any strong atypical blood group antibody by antibody screening in the blood bank they would not be accepted as a donor or in some blood banks the blood would be drawn but the product would need to be appropriately labeled therefore donor blood plasma issued by a blood bank can be selected to be free of d antibodies and free of other atypical antibodies and such donor plasma issued from a blood bank would be suitable for a recipient who may be d positive or d negative as long as blood plasma and the recipient are abo compatible  citation neededuniversal donors and universal recipients  edita hospital corpsman with the blood donor team from naval medical center portsmouth takes samples of blood from a donor for testing in transfusions of packed red blood cells individuals with type o rh d negative blood are often called universal donors those with type ab rh d positive blood are called universal recipients however these terms are only generally true with respect to possible reactions of the recipients antia and antib antibodies to transfused red blood cells and also possible sensitization to rh d antigens one exception is individuals with hh antigen system also known as the bombay phenotype who can only receive blood safely from other hh donors because they form antibodies against the h antigen present on all red blood cells 30 31blood donors with exceptionally strong antia antib or any atypical blood group antibody may be excluded from blood donation in general while the plasma fraction of a blood transfusion may carry donor antibodies not found in the recipient a significant reaction is unlikely because of dilution additionally red blood cell surface antigens other than a b and rh d might cause adverse reactions and sensitization if they can bind to the corresponding antibodies to generate an immune response transfusions are further complicated because platelets and white blood cells wbcs have their own systems of surface antigens and sensitization to platelet or wbc antigens can occur as a result of transfusion for transfusions of plasma this situation is reversed type o plasma containing both antia and antib antibodies can only be given to o recipients the antibodies will attack the antigens on any other blood type conversely ab plasma can be given to patients of any abo blood group because it does not contain any antia or antib antibodies antibodyfree blood typing  edittypically blood type tests are performed through addition of a blood sample to a solution containing antibodies corresponding to each antigen the presence of an antigen on the surface of the blood cells is indicated by agglutination an alternative system for blood type determination involving no antibodies was developed in 2017 at imperial college london which makes use of paramagnetic molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles with affinity for specific blood antigens 32 in these tests rather than agglutination a positive result is indicated by decolorization as red blood cells which bind to the nanoparticles are pulled toward a magnet and removed from solution blood group genotyping  editin addition to the current practice of serologic testing of blood types the progress in molecular diagnostics allows the increasing use of blood group genotyping in contrast to serologic tests reporting a direct blood type phenotype genotyping allows the prediction of a phenotype based on the knowledge of the molecular basis of the currently known antigens this allows a more detailed determination of the blood type and therefore a better match for transfusion which can be crucial in particular for patients with needs for many transfusions to prevent alloimmunization 33 34history  editkarl landsteiner two blood group systems were discovered by karl landsteiner during early experiments with blood transfusion the abo group in 1901 35  full citation needed and in cooperation with alexander s wiener the rhesus group in 1937 36 37 development of the coombs test in 1945 38 the advent of transfusion medicine and the understanding of abo hemolytic disease of the newborn led to discovery of more blood groups and now 33 human blood group systems are recognized by the international society of blood transfusion isbt 3 and in the 33 blood groups over 600 blood group antigens have been found 4 many of these are rare or are mainly found in certain ethnic groups czech serologist jan janský is credited with the first classification of blood into the four types a b ab o in 1907 which remains in use today blood types have been used in forensic science and were formerly used to demonstrate impossibility of paternity eg a type ab man cannot be the father of a type o infant but both of these uses are being replaced by genetic fingerprinting which provides greater certainty 39according to the austrian federal ministry of health  full citation needed the original terminology used by karl landsteiner in 1901 for the classification is a b and 0  zero  the o  oh found in the abo group system is actually a subsequent variation occurred during the translation process probably due to the similar shape between the number 0 and the letter o society and culture  editmain article blood type personality theory a popular belief in japan is that a persons abo blood type is predictive of their personality character and compatibility with others this belief is also widespread in south korea 40 and taiwan the theory reached japan in a 1927 psychologists report and the government of the time commissioned a study aimed at breeding better soldiers 40 interest in the theory faded in the 1930s ultimately the discovery of dna in the following decades indicated that dna instead had an important role in both heredity generally and personality specifically interest in the theory was revived in the 1970s by masahiko nomi a broadcaster with a background in law rather than science 40 the theory is widely accepted in japanese and south korean
