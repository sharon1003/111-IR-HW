with disabilities act ada requires restaurants to be handicapped accessible summarythe answer is yes for ada purposes a restaurant is a place of public accommodation subject to the act  s accessibility standards this means that any restaurant opened for first occupancy after january 26 1993 must be readily accessible to people with disabilities unless it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements the standard applies to everything from parking spaces to entrances dining areas and restrooms restaurants that opened for first occupancy before the 1993 cutoff date do not have to be fully accessible but they must remove architectural and communication barriers if readily achievable and if not readily achievable provide an alternative method of making goods and services available to people with disabilities also if any major renovations take place after january 26 1992 the renovated area of the facility must be made readily accessible to people with disabilities to the maximum extent feasible more information on the ada is available at the department of justice doj webpage at httpwwwusdojgovcrtadaadahom1htm adaada which took effect on january 26 1992 is a federal law aimed at providing “a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities” 42 usc § 12101 b 1 it prohibits discrimination in several areas against people with disabilities title iii states that no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of a disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods services facilities privileges advantages or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns leases or leases to or operates a place of public accommodation 42 usc § 12182 a the act requires places of public accommodation operated by private entities to be designed constructed and altered in compliance with its accessibility standards ada applies to a wide range of facilities whose operations affect commerce these include restaurants bars and other food serving establishments 42 usc § 12181 7 and 28 cfr § 36104 ada does not apply to 1 private clubs exempted from coverage under title ii of the 1964 civil rights act 2 religious organizations or entities controlled by such organizations and 3 multifamily buildings which are covered by the 1988 federal housing administration act 42 usc §§ 12187  12204 et seq new facilities ada requires that restaurants and other places of public accommodation constructed for first occupancy after january 26 1993 be designed and built to be readily accessible to people with disabilities unless it is “structurally impracticable” to do so 42 usc § 12183 a 1 “readily accessible” means that a reasonable number of elements such as parking spaces and bathrooms are handicapped accessible existing facilities ada requires owners of restaurants and other public accommodations that predate the 1993 cutoff date to remove barriers where readily achievable eg eliminate turnstiles widen doors and install ramps when not readily achievable they must provide an alternative method of making their goods and services available to people with disabilities “readily achievable” means easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense 42 usc § 12181 8 readily achievable modifications include lowering telephones and installing grab bars where only routine wall reinforcement is required ada also requires existing public accommodations to 1 make reasonable modifications to their policies practices and procedures to make their goods or services available to people with disabilities if modification would not fundamentally alter the goods or services and 2 provide auxiliary aids for people with disabilities if doing so would not alter the nature of the goods or services or impose an undue burden on the establishments alterations if alterations are made to an existing restaurant or other public accommodation after january 26 1992 the altered portion of the facility must be handicapped accessible to the maximum extent feasible 42 usc § 12183 a 2 doj has indicated that it will construe this provision to apply to alterations that require a state county or local government permit according to doj  s regulations alterations include remodeling renovation and changes in structural parts or configuration of walls but exclude normal maintenance painting or asbestos removal “to the maximum extent feasible” means that features being altered must be made handicapped accessible unless it is not technically feasible when a proposed alteration to an existing restaurant or other public accommodation could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function the path of travel to the altered area and to the bathrooms telephones and drinking fountains serving that area must be made accessible unless the cost of the pathoftravel alterations are disproportionate to the cost and scope of the overall alterations 42 usc § 12183 a 2 the cost is disproportionate if it exceeds 20 percent of the cost of the underlying alteration 28 cfr § 36403 f in this case the path of travel must be made handicapped accessible without going over the 20 percent giving priority to those elements that provide the greatest access ada does not require alterations but it requires alterations that affect usability to be made in a manner that provides handicapped access historic properties properties on or eligible for listing on the national register of historic places or properties designated as historic under state or local law are subject to less stringent requirements if full compliance with ada would threaten their historical significance disabilities ada defines a disability as1 any physical or mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity2 having a history of such an impairment or3 being regarded as
