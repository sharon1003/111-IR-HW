were returned to the temple of light amy and her group went there when void went after perfect precioustone inside the temple though void was consumed by sadness and became a monster while amy and her friends beat void lumina lost hope as the perfect precioustone did not recovered when sonic found void who had become a dark gem amy helped make lumina accept void by telling her how negative feelings

control of the shuttle when a stray asteroid released his emerald shards causing amys team to crash on the ark onboard however amy was left behind by sonic and tails while they left to destroy the eclipse cannon no sooner amy was taken hostage by dr eggman who demanded tails chaos emerald in exchange for amys life sonic arrived to fulfill the barging but eggman knew they were trying to give him a fake emerald so he trapped sonic in a capsule set to explode as amy received sonics goodbyes his capsule was shot into space and exploded leaving amy griefstricken after tails beat eggman though they still lost their chaos emerald amy and tails heard sonic who survived the explosion over the radio and they watched him destroy the eclipse cannon as amy reunited with everyone though it was revealed the space colony ark was now on a collision course with earth everyone then saw a recording of gerald robotnik announcing to the world that the ark would crash into the planet and destroy it

powered by the seven chaos emeralds to stop the space colonys crash course amy pleading for shadows help on their way amy was left behind but then came across shadow who wished maria avenged as well

the final fortress once they got there team rose defeated eggman in his egg emperor in a final confrontation though their opponent ended up being another fake they found chocola and froggy in its remains and had a happy reunion no sooner amy saw sonic nearby and quickly chased after him not long after team rose sonic chaotix and dark united to see neo metal sonic reveal himself it turned out that metal sonic who had been impersonating eggman was the true kidnapper of froggy and chocola and the one staging the teams adventures so he could copy their data to conquer the world himself as neo metal sonic transformed into metal madness the real dr eggman saw the teams had collected all the chaos emeralds and got the idea of using the emeralds against metal sonic amy and her team then volunteered to stall metal madness with the others while team sonic prepared the chaos emeralds despite team roses efforts the robot transformed into metal overlord but team super sonic then arrived and defeated him while amy watched on after the battle amy resume her chase after sonic saying goodbye to her team while doing so shadow the hedgehog in shadow the hedgehog amy joined sonic and several of her friends in battling the black arms who had begun invading earth and would try convincing shadow to join their cause she appears in shadows hero missions cryptic castle at cryptic castle amy discovered cream and cheese had not returned from the castle and therefore headed out to find them on her way she met shadow and asked for help to look for cream and cheese in the hero scenario where shadow accepted amys request amy and shadow managed to find both cream and cheese later amy came to shadows aid when the hedgehog was attacked by dr eggman and his egg breaker eventually the two destroyed eggmans battle mech and collected one of the chaos emeralds that shadow had found before being interrupted by eggman last story in the last story amy sonic tails knuckles rouge and dr eggman found shadow and tried to stop him from giving the chaos emeralds to black doom the black arms leader black doom however took the emeralds and used an enhanced chaos control to transport the black comet to the surface planning to use humans as energy sources for his kind shortly after amy and her allies were paralyzed by a special nerve gas and black doom unleashed the death leeches to prey on them however it turned out shadow was immune to the gas and he left amy and the others behind as he went to stop black doom soon after amy and the other got out of the black comet and found some shelter from where she and the others cheered super shadow on as he fought and defeated devil doom after super shadow sent the black comet back into space and blew it up with the eclipse cannon amy was positive shadow had survived when rouge worried about it before joining her friends for a laugh as knuckles furiously chased eggman around sonic battle in sonic battle amy had moved to central city when out looking for sonic amy met tails and emerl a gizoid sonic had found which dr eggman was after asking tails about emerl tails explained that emerl was like sonics baby project however amy took this statement literally and thought that sonic was testing her to see if she would be a capable mother tails tried to tell her otherwise but amy snapped back scaring him off alone with emerl amy told him to call her mommy with positive results but then rouge came to steal emerl for her own purposes amy fought rouge to protect emerl but was defeated remorsefully amy told tails what happened before tracking rouge down twice to take emerl back by force but kept failing when sonic himself got emerl back from rouge amy showed up to smack rouge some more while promising sonic she would make a good mother much to sonics confusion haunted by her failure to keep emerl safe amy resolved to become stronger so she could protect him and so took up boxercising however she began training excessively when she figured she could get sonic to notice her by losing weight during her training amy would drag cream and cheese into helping her later amy met knuckles and emerl at her apartment where she hoped sonic had come to propose some time later amy resumed her search for sonic and got his location from tails when she found sonic and emerl she berated sonic for his parenting until he ran away when emerl made a bad choice of words however amy took this as a test to see if she could protect emerl from eggman which she accepted soon after amy and emerl were attacked by e121 phi which they defeated them and seized their emerald shards knowing emerl developed with each chaos emeralds he got amy figured sonic would accept her as his wife if she helped emerl mature with more emeralds amy working out with emerl and cream before searching for emeralds amy took emerl to her apartment to help him practice some fighting moves upon his request there amy met cream and told about how emerl was to help her and sonic raise a family though cream doubted it before working out with all three of them until she collapsed from exhaustion emerl soon after sensed a chaos emerald and amy went to investigate it with him but had to fight chaos gamma on the way who amy mistook for her old rescuer arriving in night babylon amy and emerl found two and destroyed another two e121 phis and took their emerald shards tracing the last emerald shard to club rouge amy and emerl found rouge and fought her for the ownership of the shard eventually making her hand it over however rouge warned them that shadow who wanted emerl destroyed was near so amy and emerl went to tails so he could assemble their emeralds shards once tails formed a whole chaos emerald amy gave to emerl allowing him to develop more just then sonic showed up and amy told him somewhat threatening of how she had helped raise emerl and that he now had to marry her as sonic told amy to close her eyes amy expected a kiss from sonic but opened them only to see that sonic was gone however amy just attributed this to his shyness a while later amy and cream watched emerl while sonic and tails checked a lead on a chaos emerald while emerl helped amy with her exercises however eggman kidnapped emerl cream and cheese thankfully the trio was able to save themselves some time afterwards amy met emerl who asked her for a fight so he could face shadow amy accepted and was defeated but was more concerned about her diet later amy came to see emerl stop eggman and his final egg blaster onboard the death egg through a monitor when eggman was defeated however eggman fired the final egg blaster destroying some stars causing emerl to revert to his original programming which was bend on destruction however eggman could not control emerl as excepted and emerl prepared to fire the final egg blaster at earth with sonic the only one capable of stopping emerl amy begged him to do it when sonics original plan to stop emerl with the master emerald failed however he had to destroy emerl once it was done the world was saved but everyone mourned emerls death sonic rush in sonic rush amy was once again on the lookout for sonic during her search amy met cream and her new friend blaze the cat and quickly asked cream if she had seen sonic but without luck amy was then introduced to blaze by cream but she got a little mad and threaten cream when she mentioned her shortcomings after that amy greeted blaze though she warned her not be looking for sonic out of affection before taking off to find him eventually she found sonic who tried to ask her where blaze was amy believing this meant sonic liked blaze was then about to explode with anger but calmed down once tails explained the situation amy then told them where she was only for sonic and tails to leave her behind amy tells blaze about having friends afterwards amy met cream and blaze again and told them sonic was looking for them but blaze dismissed that as she did not want sonics help for finding the last of her missing sol emeralds amy however insisted she could rely on friends and told her with cream about how they were all friends now when knuckles then arrived to settle an dispute with blaze amy held him back while cream and blaze got away some time later in the aftermath of sonic and blazes final battles with dr eggman and dr eggman nega amy came affectionately towards sonic to celebrate the victory but made sonic run away leaving amy to chase him soon after amy sonic tails knuckles and cream came to blazes aid when eggman and eggman nega drained all her sol emeralds of their power to conquer both sonics dimension and blazes world with amy and the others support blaze recharged the sol emeralds becoming burning blaze and joined up with super sonic as they defeated the doctors and saved both worlds sonic riders series sonic riders amy meeting team sonic during the grand prix in sonic riders amy signed up for dr eggman s ex world grand prix to keep her eye on sonic  who was also participating along with team sonic after the qualifications rounds amy found sonic and told him why she was participating much to sonics dismay amy then heard tails  explanation surrounding the legends of the babylon rogues an opposing team in the competition working for eggman and babylon garden until they met wave the swallow who walked by and mocked tails blue star and placed a bomb on it while angry at wave for this amy soon after hurried out to the next race where she faced wave but was defeated eliminating amy from the tournament at the the grand prix finals amy came to cheer sonic on in hopes of winning by beating jet jet won however and amy and the rest witnessed jet use his winning prize the seven chaos emeralds in tandem with the key to babylon garden to reveal babylon garden itself intending to claim its treasure when eggman then snatched the key to claim the treasure himself amy tried to stop him but ended up riding the doctors egg mobile to babylon garden on babylon garden amy was taken hostage by eggman when sonic then came to stop eggman amy was used as a shield by the doctor to keep sonic away however sonic created a series of windstorms on his extreme gear which freed amy from eggmans grasp amy however was furious at sonic for endangering her with those moves and chased him around with her piko piko hammer her chase was interrupted however when they heard a roar and went to check it out venturing inside babylon garden amy and her friends saw the babylon rouges had awoken the babylon guardian when looking for treasure of babylon and were forced to fight it after beating the babylon guardian amy and the others found the treasure of babylon which turned out to be a magic carpet much to the disappointment of eggman with this ordeal over amy and her friends departed from the babylon rogues for the time being sonic riders zero gravity in sonic riders zero gravity a few months after the world grand prix 8 amy was in botanical kingdom when she found a mysterious stone after just picking it up however she was chased by scrhds a part of a currently global robot rampage who were after the meteorite while running away from the robots amy found team sonic where she quickly flirted with sonic before telling her story with team sonic also having such a meteorite and being targeted by the robots too amy and her friends decided to head to meteor tech the creator of the robots for answers amy forcing storm to help her when they got there amy and her group were discovered by security however the babylon rogues arrived and jet repelled the security robots with another meteorite and demanded amys meteorite the ark of the cosmos amy however not knowing what it was did not understand him when more security robots showed up and everyone tried to leave amy was blocked by storm who demanded her meteorite but she hit storm with her piko piko hammer and ran away as storm continued to chase after her to aquatic capital amy chose to give up the meteorite by throwing it in his face before forcing him to lead her back to sonic during the trip however they were ambushed by scrhd who blew up when it scanned their ark of the cosmos amy was then left behind when storm took scrhds ark of the cosmos and ran back home amy remembers gigan rocks soon after amy was reunited with team sonic who had looked for her and she explained what had happened knuckles thought the robot rampage would stop now since their leader was gone but tails having learned dr eggman started it by putting an ark of the cosmos in meteo tech’s mother computer figured it would only stop if they removed the ark of the cosmos from the mother computer as they tried to figure out where the mother computer could be amy remembered storm mentioning gigan rocks a place with information about the ark of the cosmos under knuckles guide amy and her friends went there to search for clues arriving at gigan rocks the group discovered from the ruins that the arks of the cosmos were power units for babylon garden amy and her friends saw the babylon rogues chase after eggman above them and learned the location of meteo tech’s mother computer by the direction eggman fled and the ruins of gigan rocks traveling there amy and her group found the crimson tower and the babylon rogues who explained eggman stole their arks of the cosmos concluding eggman planned to use them to control all the worlds robots for world domination amy and her friends raced the babylon rogues to eggman with the arks of the cosmos at stake at the end of the race the two groups stopped eggmans plans ended the global robot rampage and additionally prevented the reactivated scrhd from using the arks of the cosmos to create a black hole that could destroy the world returning to monopole with her friends amy heard from tails of how the arks of the cosmos made the robots to go amok and she thought that the tradition of wishing upon a star was started by the ancient babylonians who hoped shooting stars were the arks of the cosmos falling down to earth so they could get back home no sooner though amy and then others saw jet flying by who challenged sonic to a race which sonic accepted sonic free riders amy in sonic free riders in sonic free riders amy followed sonic to the newest world grand prix hosted by dr eggman hoping that sonic would participate amy decided to join to see him since it was a team competition amy reformed team rose by making cream rejoin and hiring vector as a member too by promising him half of the prize money after barely getting into the competition in time which amy blamed vector for team rose went up against team heroes for their first race which amy took as a sign of fate as team rose won their faceoffs amy thought sonic was letting her win though he was not after beating team heroes amy promised sonic a date after her team won the grand prix for their next race amy and her team faced team babylon who mocked them for their uselessness but amy claimed only vector was useless in the end team rose defeated team babylon and amy contributed this to her love for sonic in the finals team rose went up against team dark while amy had procured one victory after another amy argued with vector about his cockiness until cream stopped them when it seemed like team rose finally beat team dark and had secured their victory however vector blurted out that e10000b was too damaged to be in the race meaning their last victory did not count as a rematch was issued amy accused vector for the damage before resuming the competition once team rose secured their defeat of team dark and their tournament victory amy was overjoyed and made omochao patch her to sonic there amy surprised sonic by telling him she was ready for their date now and ran off to find him during the extra rounds team rose had their own fair share of defeats too where amy would be sour about their losses but nevertheless passionate about sonic at the end of the tournament amy and the other teams came to the awards ceremony to collect their prizes but eggman made them have a final race against his ultimate gearjockey robot following the race eggman revealed his agenda he used the grand prix to collect the everyones racing data with his e10000 robots to create the ultimate extreme gear for him to use as eggman challenged the others to a race amy gladly accepted it after beating eggman amy demanded their prize money when suddenly metal sonic revealed himself as the one controlling the participant e10000b and giving fake data to eggman so he could take the real data for himself to beat sonic in extreme gear riding following this revelation amy and the others watched sonic and metal sonic engage in a heated race with sonic being victorious with the world grand prix coming to a close it was revealed eggman never had a prize to give out upsetting vector though amy remarked he should be feeling privileged to have raced with cuties like her and cream sonic the hedgehog 2006in sonic the hedgehog 2006 amy was out looking for sonic once more and had tracked him to soleanna during the night amy found silver the hedgehog who she believed was sonic and hugged him but quickly realized her mistake when amy learned however that she had made silver lose sight of someone he was looking for amy promised to help silver find that person despite his protest amy and silver looking for sonic prioritizing her own search first amy had silver help her find sonic before she would help silver with his search though silver was not interested at first following sonics trail amy and silver found him in castle town but to amys shock silver attempted to kill sonic who was actually the one he had been looking for however amy stopped silver before he could land the final blow allowing sonic to escape confused amy heard silver explanation that sonic would soon destroy the world but amy refused to believe this even if it turned out to be true and left silver in anger amy later resumed her pursuit for sonic and infiltrated dr eggman s base during her search when she attempted to flee when she realized the danger present however amy met princess elise as she was escaping from eggmans captivity and amy rescued her from the base later out in the free amy learned who elise was when they introduced themselves and that someone had helped elise beforehand amy took this as a sign that elise was in love with that person which she could relate and wished her good luck before escorting elise to safety amy crying over sonics death later on amy met up with tails and knuckles in castle town when they were suddenly caught in a spatial distortion created by solaris and send to end of the world where they were united with shadow silver rouge e123 omega and eggman there amy found sonic and elise and was heartbroken when she discovered that sonic was dead having been killed by mephiles the dark to remake solaris with solaris preparing to destroy time and amy crying over sonics passing however elise sensed that sonics soul was still among them which made amy and the others set out to find the chaos emeralds to bring sonic back to life after elise revived sonic as super sonic amy wept at his return and supported him as he super shadow and super silver took off and defeated solaris when sonic and elise then ensured solaris never came to exist time was reverted resulting in the events and memories of the adventure being erased and amy to be returned to where she was prior to the events sonic rivals in sonic rivals amy was turned into a card by dr eggman nega with his special camera when eggman nega later met sonic and tails on onyx island the doctor showed amys card to sonic and explained what he had done to her before turning tails into a card as well making sonic set off to save both his friends 9 when eggman nega later escaped to his space station the doctor planned to use amys card along with some other cards to fuel his special camera as he used it to turn earth into a card but he was stopped by sonic knuckles shadow and silver after the battle amy was returned to normal by sonic and she took this as a sign that they were to live happily together sonic however claimed he had to find eggman nega’s other card captives and ran off much to amys dismay sonic chronicles the dark brotherhood in sonic chronicles the dark brotherhood amy joined sonic tails and knuckles the echidna as they attacked dr eggman on the egg carrier together they made the egg carrier crash into metropolis and they all assumed eggman had perished following the battle amy claiming to sonic that she has gotten a boyfriend after the battle with eggman amy started a club for young girls to protect themselves from bullies some time later amy joined forces with tails to help find knuckles who had been kidnapped by a group dubbed the  marauders  who had stolen all the chaos emeralds when tails recruited sonic for the search amy went to meet sonic on the halfway so he was safe when they met amy tried to get sonics attention by pretending that she had a new boyfriend called dexter so he would be jealous but with limited success along their way to tails amy and sonic took care of a marauder with some help from g u n amy and her friends succeeded in finding the marauders hideout where they were reunited with knuckles the team then attempted to head for angel island to protect the master emerald from the marauders but they discovered the entire island had been hijacked suspecting eggman was working with marauders amy and her group began searching for the doctor the team soon found dr eggman only to heard the doctor claim he had been reformed which amy highly doubted nevertheless eggman claimed that he was against the marauders too and that he would help amy and the others fight the marauders by leading them into metropolis where the marauders had drawn angel island to with the chaos emeralds which the group accepted on their way to metropolis amy and her team met shade and discovered that she and the marauders were a group of echidnas from the nocturnus clan exiled to the twilight cage over four millennia ago while amy and the team beat shade and her lackeys shade blocked the way to metropolis but amy and the others found a way around after getting inside the city amy and her allies made it to angel island where they helped sonic in his attempt to stop the nocturnus clans leader imperator ix who sought to rule the world from stealing the master emerald while putting up a good fight ix escaped with the master emerald and used it to create a wormhole into sonic’s dimension so the nocturnus clan could conquer it as a result of the master emeralds absence angel island fell from the sky but amy and the others survived the crash after regrouping the team came up with the plan of going after ix into the twilight cage and reclaim the emeralds to stop ix with shade joining amy and the others to stop ix as she had realized her leaders evil plan using the blue cyclone tail and eggman created for the journey amy and her friends ventured into the twilight cage while eggman stayed on earth to watch the wormhole inside the twilight cage amy and her team got five of the chaos emeralds back and gained alliances with the alien races within the twilight cage when they prepared infiltrated nocturne to find the last emeralds the group was able to get to this planetoid thanks to the help from their alien allies depending on the players choices at this point amy will reveal to sonic that she made up dexter once on nocturne amy and her team got the last chaos emeralds back and amy came to help in the final battle against ix while knuckles got the master emerald back after ix had been defeated by sonic the echidna leader began to close the wormhole out of the twilight cage but amy and the others got through it just in time when they returned home however amy and her friends saw that much time had passed thus allowing eggman to rebuild his forces which they faced upon exit from the twilight cage in battle amy has the highest damage power and medium armor and she is quite fast allowing her to attack twice per round sonic unleashed amy meeting sonic in his werehog form in sonic unleashed amy once again pursued sonic she eventually found him in spagonia at night where she was quick to hug him as she took a look at sonic however she could not recognize him due to him being in his werehog form believing him to be a stranger amy apologized and ran off inadvertently depressing sonic not long after amy was forced to dance with some people possessed by dark gaias minions but was saved by sonic and chip but before amy could get a look at sonic he fled she soon after met professor pickle and had him tell her everything about sonic after learning about sonics new form amy met up with sonic and told him that he was still him to her despite his look from there amy followed sonic tails chip and pickle in their mission to restore the earth after dr eggman had broken it apart while sonic and chip were gone on adventures amy would help pickle with his work and await their safe return when pickle later moved to his research facility in shamar amy came with later after sonic and chip went to fully restore the planet by sealing dark gaia the creature behind the planets shattering amy and pickle saw the sky turning dark as pickle recognized this as dark gaias act to destroy the world and despaired amy had unwavering faith that sonic would save them as amy predicted the world was soon after returned to normal thanks to sonic and chip when they defeated perfect dark gaia with everyone celebrating amy shorty listened to pickles reflection on the meaning of light and dark gaia before deciding to prepare a coming home party for sonic with pickle sonic and the black knight in sonic and the black knight amy had managed to make a date with sonic but when the time came for it he did not show up when amy met sonic later he explained he had been on an adventure in the world of camelot however amy believed sonic made that up as an excuse for forgetting their date before proceeding to chase after sonic and attacking him with her piko piko hammer  sonic colors amy finding sonic and tails in the nintendo ds version of sonic colors amy after going on a long time without seeing sonic managed to track sonic to aquarium park on dr eggmans incredible interstellar amusement park upon finding sonic and tails amy was overly excited to see him again and asked him to complete a mission for her entertainment after sonic finished it amy noted it was dreamy and asked sonic to marry her causing sonic to ditch her and leave her with tails when sonic completed her mission with excellence amy began planning her honeymoon with him only to notice he had run away later on amy found big and had him help her find sonic despite that big was looking for froggy once they found sonic amy asked him to do another mission for them as entertainment while they rested from their search after sonic was done amy decided to have a picnic with him believing they were certainly on a date despite tails commenting that they were in the middle of eggmans base sonic generations in the console pc version of sonic generations amy attended and helped prepare sonic s surprise birthday party as the party started however the time eater suddenly appeared amy was then sucked into one of the time eaters time holes and ended up in the white space where she was turned into a statue due to the time eaters effects amy after returning to normal eventually amy was returned to normal by sonic and classic sonic when the sonics confronted the time eater which was revealed to be controlled by eggman and classic eggman amy arrived at the battle with the others and cheered on both sonics allowing them both to transform into super sonics when the sonics defeated the time eater amy and the others were sent back to the present where amy knocked knuckles into a tree for deeming sonics performance halfbad continuing the celebration from where it left off amy later waved goodbye to classic sonic and classic tails when they returned to their own world sonic jump 2012in sonic jump 2012 amy and co discovered that eggman had begun kidnapping animals again and taking them high into the sky prompting the heroes to set out to stop dr eggmans operations whenever they managed to corner eggman in a zone and defeat him however the doctor would retreat to another zone although not before capturing more animals after eggmans defeat in mechanical zone however the doctor would crash down to earth ending his plans thus allowing amy to reunite with all the animals sonic lost world in sonic lost world amy remained behind with knuckles to look after some animals while sonic and tails went to free the other animals dr eggman had captured while waiting amy contacted sonic who reported they only rescued one capsule of animals and she pleaded to him to save the others amy watching the life being sucked out of the world when the deadly six took control of eggmans extractor and began draining the life energy out of earth amy contacted sonic and tails and reported about this phenomenon eventually amy herself became drained of her energy to the point where her death seemed imminent contacting sonic amy told him it was too late for them and urged him to save the world as their transmission got cut out fortunately she and everyone else were saved when sonic and tails got the extractor to return the stolen energy following the worlds restoration amy welcomed sonic and tails back when they arrived sonic forces in sonic forces after dr eggman had successfully defeated sonic and seemingly killed him and conquered over 99 of the world amy and her allies formed a ragtag resistance group to counter the eggman empire s reign while knuckles led the resistance amy would handle the communication work 10 as six months went by without the resistance making much progress amy still affected by sonics absence would dream that he was still with them amy working in the resistance hq during a meeting in the resistance hq amy looked up the file for the new recruit that was joining them for the rest to see afterward knuckles introduced the avatar to amy and the others soon after amy learned from knuckles that sonic was still alive much to her joy although he was currently imprisoned onboard the newlyrebuilt death egg with the resistance planning to save sonic amy joined a squad on a mission to the spaceport where they procured a shuttle to head to the death egg in however amys team had to speed up their rescue when they learned from rouge that eggman had caught wind of their efforts and had moved sonics execution ahead of schedule fortunately the resistance and the avatar ultimately rescued and found sonic whom amy immediately tried to talk to once he was on the radio and brought him back to earth  with sonic in the resistance amy guided him and the avatar when they attacked arsenal pyramid afterward however amy detected a battle between silver and infinite eggmans new henchman in mystic jungle and sent sonic to help silver while sonic headed there amy noticed the eggman fleet s unfortunate bombardment of the local resistance troops while trying to keep sonic updated discovering later that the eggman army had broken into the city amy had the resistance mount an evacuation amy herself kept the hq updated on the battle in the city which ended with the eggman army retreating later on amy followed and guided the avatar when they went to aqua road to investigate two lifeforms these lifeforms turned out to be tails and classic sonic the latter having been brought to amys dimension by eggmans new power as the two were brought into the restance amy learned from tails that eggman had a plan that would wipe them all out in three days soon after amy kept sonic posted on the whereabouts of shadow who had seemingly joined the eggman empire when sonic went to confront the black hedgehog in the aftermath however amy learned from the real shadow who joined the resistance that the familiar faces in eggmans army were but replicas created by infinite during operation big wave amy kept the resistance posted on the losses they suffered as a result of infinites phantom ruby prototype s power ultimately the resistance was forced to withdraw afterward the resistance began looking for a way to stop the phantom rubies in the meantime amy discovered a metal sonic replica in the city which she guided sonic and the avatar to when the resistance later discovered that they could stop the phantom rubies by destroying their power source onboard the death egg amy benched knuckles who wanted to be a part of the plan to destroy the death egg since the resistance needed his leadership when the avatar later attacked guardian rock to distract the eggman army as a part of their plan amy provided the resistance army with analyses and updates on the death crab that roamed the area as planned the avatars distraction allowed the resistance to destroy the death egg whose destruction amy observed from the hq believing the phantom rubies to be out of commission the battleweary amy joined another attack on metropolis their objective being to capture eggman and end the war during the battle amy kept sonic posted on his search for the doctor although eggman evaded capture the resistance managed to capture metropolis something which amy told sonic when victory seemed imminent they also learned much to their horror that eggman had a backup power supply for his phantom rubies underneath the eggman empire fortress  amy fighting a metal sonic replica having less than an hour left before eggman began his endgame amy and the resistance attacked the eggman empire tower where they faced eggmans replica army and infinite during the attack e123 omega came to the rescue of amy and co when infinite threatened to finish them it was then that infinite executed eggmans endgame using his phantom ruby he created a sun to drop on the resistance thanks to the avatar however the sun was vanquished allowing amy and her friends to continue the fight after sonic and the avatar defeated infinite amy follow their and classic sonics subsequent efforts that led to the destruction of the phantom rubies reactor eggman however had foreseen this and his used his original phantom ruby in conjunction with his death egg robot to create thousands of replicas to overwhelm amy and the rest with fortunately sonic the avatar and classic sonic beat eggman and destroyed his phantom ruby which made his replica army vanish and left the resistance as the victors in the aftermath amy bid farewell to classic sonic whose return to his dimension was imminent with the phantom ruby now gone amy then followed sonics example and set out to clean up the mess eggman had left the world in a while later during a last meeting in the resistance hq amy saw knuckles disband the resistance as the avatar announced their departure the friends then agreed with tails that even though they were going back to their old lives they would be friends forever and keep working together to restore the world other game appearances sonic drift series sonic drift amy and her breeze as featured in sonic drift in sonic drift amy is one of the four

shield personality amys profile in sonic generations amy in the main series is presented as being somewhat kind and girly in sonic the hedgehog cd she was referred to as an optimistic tomboy who loves fortunes and uses tarot cards because of her tomboyish nature she became a playable character as a fighter in sonic the fighters however after sonic adventure amy had grown a more feminine personality such as an interest in shopping and fashion but that did not remove her tomboyish nature however in the later games she has the personality of a girlygirl more so than a tomboy unlike the earlier games in the more recent games amy has become a bit more obsessive and far more aggressive much to sonics dismay she often shows her anger by pulling out her piko piko hammer out of hammerspace sometimes threatening sonic with it in sonic battle her attraction towards boxercise plays to both elements of her everchanging personality the exercise helping her lose weight to maintain her girlish figure and the boxing to help her train when shes forced to fight in sonic battle she had shown a very powerful and aggressive attitude willing to fight whenever necessary despite her aggressive tendencies amy has a kind heart never gives up and is one of the most optimistic and cheerful characters amy is always full of hope and is always cheering on for the good side of things she almost never seems to find anything hopeless as shown in sonic adventure where she was determined to help the flicky who had lost his family in sonic adventure 2 amy felt strongly that there was a chance for the world to be saved and that people were basically good as she told shadow  amy is often a likable person she has rarely met anyone who she did not befriend including shadow and blaze  amy is a cheerful and caring individual with a positive outlook on life and an over sweeping infatuation for sonic since 2010 after the release of sonic free riders amy seems to be more bossy and infatuated with sonic than before this is most likely due to the more light and humorous nature of recent sonic games amys personality has added more a humorous factor in games like sonic colors sonic free riders and sonic generations with her obsession for sonic which causes her to say silly and embarrassing things powers and abilities physical abilities while not superhuman amy possesses aboveaverage physical attributes making her a powerful figure in her own right she has high physical strength wielding her apparently heavy piko piko hammers with little effort and swings them around with enough force to smash clean through metal send enemies sky rocketing fly around like a helicopter rotor create whirlwinds generate shock waves or send herself flying by hammering into the ground on top of that amy could slap knuckles with enough force to sent him flying into a tree without even trying amy is capable of running at super speeds which sterns from her practice of chasing after sonic and her innate hedgehog abilities 12 13 while her exact top speed is unclear she can run fast enough to even keep sonic on a constant lookout for her suggesting she is a remarkably fast runner however amy has admitted herself that she is not as fast as sonic 14amy has as well good acrobatic skills and agility being able to handle and swing her large piko piko hammer gracefully and without disturbing her when airborne perform various forms of movements and tricks when launched into midair and grind on rails with ease combat skills said to be stronger than most people give her credit for 15 amy is a tough fighter though her combat skills are not as developed as those of sonic knuckles or tails 16 combined with her aggressiveness though amy can be a fierce opponent in a confrontation while the martial arts she has trained under are more reminiscing of exercises amy knows how to defend herself against and can go up against powerful robots and highly trained combatants fighting style amy attacks using her piko piko hammer amys fighting style focuses heavily of her piko piko hammer in battle she uses her hammers size and durability to her advantage either using it to knock opponents far away or bringing the entirety of its weight down on the opponents crushing them with devastating force for more offensive moves amy twirls around with her piko piko hammer either turning herself into a spinning top that mows down everything in her path or stirring up whirlwinds and shock waves to blow the opponents away though such maneuvers can leave her dizzy however amy can as well fight opponents handtohand though she rarely resorts to this method as seen in sonic battle when fighting opponents close up amy utilizes kickboxing moves using fast jabs and uppercuts techniques and moves amy has one of the widest ranges of moves and techniques in the series ranging from techniques involving her piko piko hammer to the basic spin attack maneuvers to even mimicries of other characters moves most of amys offensive techniques revolves around the variants of her primary technique the hammer attack a downward swing with her piko piko hammer on opponents these variants serve to compensate for amys lack of superior physical skills and moves her jump attack lets her swing her piko piko hammer in midair to attack enemies while airborne with increased attack range and her spin hammer attack and spinning hammer attack lets her spin around with her piko piko hammer to attack with increased attack range for better movements amy can use her hammer jump and midair hammer jump techniques to let her somersault higher into the air by setting off with her piko piko hammer from where she is positioned and with her propeller hammer she can float through the air like a helicopter for a short time some of amys more special moves include her tornado hammer where she throws a whirlwind at opponents to blow them off the ground and the rose typhoon where she creates a domelike shock wave by hammering into the ground while she sometimes lacks it amy can also perform the various forms of the spin attack where she curls tightly into a concussive ball while in locomotion to damage mow down or burrow through obstacles and foes the homing attack allows amy to jump and home in on an enemy to get over large gaps she cannot normally reach the spin jump lets her curl into a ball to attack opponent by landing on them and the spin dash lets her shoot herself forward as an acceleration roll at high speeds to break barriers or mow down enemies miscellaneous skills amy has on several occasions proved to possess excellent tracking and dowsing skills especially when she is looking for sonic as demonstrated during her searches for sonic amy is able to locate a person no matter where in the world they are in fact at least in sonics case amy is able to feel where a person has been amys tracking skills are further enforced in sonic rush where cream told blaze that amy was sure to find sonic for them amy has displayed some skills in the mystical field primarily in reading tarot cards using her tarot cards amy is able to predict the future and give herself knowledge of future events such as successfully predicting where sonic would be in sonic the hedgehog cd and sonic battle and even curse others  in the sonic riders series amy has steadily proven herself as a very talented extreme gear rider though she did not make it to the finals during the first ex world grand prix in sonic riders she had at the time of the grand prix in sonic free riders become so skilled at riding extreme gear that she was able compete against even the worlds best extreme gear riders while riding on an extreme gear amy is skillful enough to ride on rails focus on opponents while remaining in control of her extreme gear and as well pulls off highly advanced tricks and techniques on her extreme gear while in midair in sonic the fighters amy demonstrated the ability to harness chaos energy from the chaos emeralds allowing her to enter the hyper mode in sonic the hedgehog 2006 amy also displayed the ability to turn herself invisible for a short time weapon main article piko piko hammer amys trademark weapon is the piko piko hammer a large and powerful hammer capable of dealing massive damage with no excessive efforts which she can call out from nowhere at will in amys hands the piko piko hammer is such a powerful weapon that amy can strike fear into the likes of sonic and knuckles by displaying strength and fury with it though simple in function amy is highly adapt at wielding it and uses it with proficiency second to none she mainly uses its as a melee weapon in combat but can also use it for improving her movements performing longranged attacks and even mimic the spin attack variants color powers main article color power by harnessing different variants of hypergoon from wisps amy can use specific color powers to transform into a certain form such as a drill a laser or even a planet each one possessing its own unique abilities so far amy has been able to transform into the cyan laser yellow drill and indigo asteroid however these transformations require a steady supply of hypergoon to be maintained relationships sonic the hedgehog sonic this time theres no way outta marrying me— amy rose sonic heroes 17amy rose believes that being together with sonic the hedgehog is her destiny as foretold by her initial tarot card reading and has indeed fallen madly in love with the blue hero since her fateful rescue in sonic the hedgehog cd amy identifies herself as sonics selfproclaimed girlfriend while sonic appears annoyed by her affections her infatuation was renewed upon meeting him once again in sonic adventure where she resolved to become more independent to win over sonics heart by the end of her tale even though he seems nervous and occasionally overwhelmed by her advances sonic at least considers amy a good friend and worthy comrade and is always there to help her out should the need arise sonics emotional neglect for the most part does not seem to hurt or deter amy rather she continues to treat him as if he is hiding his feelings behind a facade which has occasionally been implied to be the case such as in the sonic heroes manual as of sonic heroes amys sonicchasing tendencies were particularly aggressive and hyperactively over the top for a while which put off sonic and only caused him to run away though she has developed a more mellow approach in recent years the latter method has apparently worked as sonic doesnt run away from her most of the time anymore and is even willing to interact with her in sonic battle amy obsesses with boxercise as part of her arduous physical training to impress sonic with her adamant dedication which mildly works but also worries him in amys story she asks tails about emerl and tails explains that emerl is like a child to sonic amy takes this literally and thinks that sonic wants her to be emerls mother amy then takes emerl away and tells him to call her his mother thus making emerl believe that amy is actually his mother figure during her story she tries hard to protect emerl after losing him to rouge at the end of her story amy tries to get sonic to propose to her but he promptly shivers at the thought and bails in sonic riders amy enters the ex world grand prix so she can be beside sonic though she becomes mad when sonic accidentally launches her into a tornado when he had to save her from dr eggman and forgot about her after getting caught in the tornado she chases sonic with her piko piko hammer as payback for forgetting about her amy protecting sonic from silver in sonic the hedgehog 2006 amys time is spent mostly trying to find sonic she teams up with silver in order to find him though when she finds out that he is trying to kill him she ditches him saying that she would choose sonic over the entire world later on during the last story nearly every important character gets sent to a timespace rift they all see that sonic is dead and amy reacts to this by kneeling down and crying into her hands she later shreds a tear when sonic is brought back to life in sonic chronicles the dark brotherhood amy insecurely claims she finally made a legitimate boyfriend named dexter during sonics long twoyear absence but unusually does not appear to have any wild schemes to get sonic to accept her through dialog trees the player can decide the extent of sonics interaction with her as well as whether his exchanges are positive negative or neutral in nature if he treats amy with high regard and respect an additional scene may occur on the kron colony near the end of the game where she pulls sonic aside for a moment wondering why he has been so nice to her after such an empty gap of time has passed there are multiple choice outcomes to this scene from sonic making it clear once and for all that he cannot be romantically invested in her to him actually admitting that he does return her feelings in some way but promising they can figure out what this means after they get home if this breakthrough occurs amy will reveal that dexter is fake to her potential boyfriend i still cant believe its you inside that thing but no matter the package youre still my sonic sonic— amy rose sonic unleashed in sonic unleashed sonic seemed depressed when amy did not recognize him as a werehog understanding that he is not the same at all in his werehog form when chip pointed it out when she finds out the werehog was sonic she wanted to know all about how it happened and had even mentioned that though sonic looks better in the day time she does not care about that near the end of the 360  ps3 version she asks sonic out on a date when she is spoken to and the player can choose whether sonic accepts or declines it if rejected she will think she earned the opportunity and get a little upset at sonics decision but otherwise she will tell sonic to hurry up and stop eggman while she excitedly plans it in sonic and the black knight s ending sonic is shown explaining to amy all about his adventure in the arthurian legend amy does not believe him and accuses thats the lamest excuse ever you just forgot about our date acknowledging his missed date sonic calmly tries to reason with her by swearing that his story is completely factual but amy does not listen and apparently pulls out her hammer in the ds version of sonic colors amy tries to have a romantic picnic with sonic at first however sonic is too busy and does not want to make the picnic look like a date later on with big and tails around he does agree since he is hungry and it does not look like a date amy also gives sonic a mission because he looks dreamy when he performs his tricks in stages amy trying to hug sonic in sonic generations amy is excited to attend sonics birthday however sonic keeps amy away from getting too close to him such as hugging him by placing his hand over her face if classic sonic rescues amy she mistakes him for the present form of sonic and questions how he looks so young whereas if the present sonic saves amy she tells sonic that she was afraid that she would never be able to flirt with him again leaving sonic wordlessly exasperated if sonic gets an s rank in chemical plant amy will compliment that sonic knows how to get the girls and when attaining a red star ring amy says that she mistook the ring for an actual ring meaning that she thought sonic was giving her a ring as a gift or for another reason amy and sonics winning animation in mario  sonic at the rio 2016 olympic games in sonic lost world amys personality was further matured compared to previous appearances showing a more nurturing and understanding side she first appears with a group of animals comforting them with knuckles she then calls sonic to check on how he is doing with rescuing flickies the third time she communicates with sonic she solemnly tells him that it was too late for her and knuckles and the planets energy is leaving them and she tries to tell sonic that she loves him before the signal dies much to sonics shock in the end they are revealed to be okay and sonic pleasantly joins them for a relaxing nap in the open meadow in mario  sonic at the rio 2016 olympic games sonic and amy have a special wining animation in which she grabs sonic hands and jump in happiness then they begin to thank the audience wow having two sonics is so dreamy— amy rose sonic forces in sonic forces amy joins knuckless resistance when eggman takes over and becomes extremely worried when sonic goes missing when rouge reveals to them that eggman merely took sonic captive and was keeping the hero in the death egg she is shown to be highly relieved she is shown to be the happiest of all resistance members alongside knuckles and later tails when she hears sonics voice on knuckles communicator while contacting the avatar through the game she also comments how dreamy is to have two sonics at the same time and does her best to help them a running gag involves amy making her entrance in a game by running into another hedgehog from the left of the screen and hugging them from behind mistaking them for sonic despite looking nothing alike up close cream the rabbit since sonic heroes cream and amy share a sisterlike relationship comparable to sonic and tails brotherlike friendship this fact is strengthened by sonic advance 3 as when they are paired together they are given the title team jubilee and serve as a female counterpart to sonic and tails unbreakable bond the two are portrayed as best friends and also seem to frequent together almost completely throughout sonic battle except when emerl drags one of them away amy is also seen searching for cream during the level cryptic castle in shadow the hedgehog which further suggests how much she cares for her in sonic rush it is implied that amy occasionally gets angry with cream angry enough to chase her with her hammer as cream shouted not again after she said that amy was shortsighted in the regard of her love of sonic when cream introduced blaze to amy the two team up twice in sonic chronicles the dark brotherhood for the moves spin cycle a move in which cream lifts amy up and sends her spinning into one enemy as well damaging adjacent ones team rose band together to perform flower power their most potent attack in this game which involves amy bouncing off big with a boost from cream and landing on a foe hammerfirst big the cat big the cat acts as an older brother figure to amy and is most likely her other best friend they form team rose and fight together in sonic heroes in sonic chronicles the dark brotherhood after meeting big in the mystic ruins big states that he heard his good friend amy rose so he rushed over to see if it was really her when big sees amy he becomes ecstatic and actually makes an attempt to hug her in which amy refuses due to the fact that he smelled from the gases in the ruins big also becomes happy that he gets to be around amy when sonic invites him to join the team miles tails prower tails and amy rarely interact with each other in games like sonic battle and sonic free riders tails tries helping sonic get away from amy in sonic battle he mistakenly tells amy that sonic is treating emerl like a son which lead her to believe that sonic wants her to be emerls mother in sonic riders amy is defensive of tails when wave makes fun of him knuckles the echidna amy has only been seen interacting with knuckles the echidna on rare occasions in sonic heroes when playing as team sonic at the beginning of the fight against team rose knuckles will taunt sonic about amy saying have you been messing with that girls heart again sonic in sonic rush amy stops knuckles from starting a fight with blaze  in sonic riders zero gravity amy budges in knuckles sentence in the end annoying the echidna however knuckles is also seen protecting amy and pulls her away out of danger in the meteor tech premises  in sonic generations amy accidentally hurts knuckles with a great force which causes him to crash into a tree after he said that sonic wasnt half bad whereas she thought he was all great however amy does not notice how hard she hit knuckles because she was busy swooning at sonic in sonic lost world they work separately from sonic and tails in saving the animals from dr eggman shadow the hedgehog i know that people fight over the most trivial things some people may be selfish like the professor said but theyre basically good if they try their best and never give up on their wishes they always have a reason to be happy thats why you should help them out saving them is a good thing— amy rose sonic adventure 2in sonic adventure 2 they interact twice amy first meets shadow when she mistakes him for sonic and hugs him from behind when amy senses the lack of a reaction she releases him causing him to glance back at her amy demands his name when she realizes that he is not sonic but he continues to watch her quietly after amy notices dr eggman she also realizes the mistake shes made and runs off screaming during this shadow takes a step after her but dr eggman stops him later in the game aboard the ark amy meets shadow again and this time does her part in helping by begging shadow to save the world at first shadow simply replies strangely in a nonthreatening way that it is pointless but then amy points out that despite people sometimes being selfish they were still inwardly good and that saving them was right shadow suddenly has a flashback of maria begging shadow to make people happy shadow then comes to his senses he goes off to fight the biolizard telling amy that he has to keep his promise to maria and her amy was also the only one to see shadows tear after he remembered maria robotnik s promise making her the only person to see him cry in sonic adventure 2 amy and maria have the same insight towards humanity thus this might be one of the reasons shadow is nice to her since its unknown whether or not shadow remembers amys deed in ark during sonic battle amy is angered by rouge who was not answering her question as to why shadow is in her house during shadow the hedgehog shadow can choose to assist amy rose in helping find cream and cheese at the end of stage shadow benevolently advises her to be more careful in the final ending amy shows an amount of faith and admiration for shadow regardless of anything bad that may have happened vector the crocodile amy and vector encountered each other in sonic heroes when the chaotix saw team rose vector wanted to ask amy a question however her rude response caused the teams to fight the next time the two were seen together was in sonic free riders vector joined amys team along with cream to win the prize money eggman advertised about his grand prix vector and amy do not seem to get along at first amy blames vector for not getting them registered for the race even when he claimed that it was not his fault as she invited him to her team 30 minutes ago also when amy pretends that she was not expecting her and sonic in the grand prix because she wanted to prove that lovers are drawn together vector disapproves her by calling her a terrible actress amy also appears to yell at vector and boss him around something she does not do to cream throughout the game even though cream is also a member of the team silver the hedgehog in sonic the hedgehog 2006 amy mistook silver for sonic amy who thought he was simply looking for someone offered to help him if he would help her unable to deny her offer silver was dragged along with amy unwillingly for a while and found her a distraction while amy became his friend and promised to help him find the iblis trigger eventually though silvers helpful nature kicked in and he set aside his quest momentarily to help her search through dusty desert silvers alliance with amy ended up being only temporary which ended once silver found sonic and tried to kill him when amy found out that silver intended to kill sonic she left silvers side strangely when they meet again after sonic dies and mephiles and iblis fuse she bears no particular malice towards him for his past actions because of what happens at the end of the game amy and silver never met in sonic forces amy and silver worked alongside each other in the resistance to defend the world from dr eggman friendsallies team sonic

her at chemical plant in sonic generations wow having two sonics is so dreamy  amy excited about being with two sonics in sonic forces  trivia amy is the first and most recurring female character in the sonic the hedgehog series in the sega cd release of sonic the hedgehog cd in america amy was referred to as princess sally in the game manual possibly to connect her to the sonic animated television series released that same year however the sally that showed up in the cartoons was not amy subsequent rereleases of sonic cd jettison any references to amy being named sally interestingly she was clearly stated as amy in the earlier european manual for sonic the hedgehog cd  in sonic chronicles the dark brotherhood amy has three lashes instead of two on some sprites during cutscenes amy was the first female character introduced in the game series as well as the only female hedgehog of the series in sonic chronicles the dark brotherhood amy is the strongest character in terms of smash ability being the only character who can reach level 3  knuckles and e123 omega can only reach level 2 smash ability amy rose is the only member of team rose that is affected by the brainwashing of the overmind voxai in sonic chronicles the dark brotherhood  in sonic r amy is one of two characters who races in a vehicle rather than on foot the other is doctor robotnik  if sonic the fighters is to be believed amy rose did not wear undergarments in the classic era  harmless pink fur covers her body underneath her skirt this was not changed in the hd release in addition to this amys muzzle and arms were colored the same white hue as her sclera instead of peach in the original arcade release of the game due to color palette limitations although prerendered graphics featured her with the correct colors this was not fixed in the sonic gems release but was fixed in the hd release in sonic riders amy sports a different racing outfit throughout the game but in sonic riders zero gravity amy wears her usual dress in the story cutscenes and in the story level where she races storm however in the single and multiplayer modes she wears the same outfit that she wore in sonic riders  amy is the only playable character in sonic the hedgehog 2006 to not travel through time at any point during the game amy is the only character that appeared in sonic rivals that did not appear in sonic rivals 2  ironically in sonic chronicles the dark brotherhood despite being the speed leader of team rose amys attack is slower than other speed leaders like sonic and shadow she is also the strongest attacker of her team despite big being the power leader amy in the french guide of sonic  knuckles amys hair has grown slightly longer in recent games the back side of her hair was noticeably shorter than the hair at the side of her face in sonic adventure but that part of the hair has been longer since sonic unleashed  in the ds version of sonic  sega allstars racing amys character and vehicle selection picture shows her car with ears and head mirrors however while racing as her they are not shown strangely amy appears in the french guide for sonic  knuckles even though she makes no appearance whatsoever in the game in that guide it was said that amy had been kidnapped by knuckles amy is the only hedgehog from the games not to have a super state she is also the only hedgehog whose name does not begin with an s she is also the only hedgehog who is not shown to be able to use chaos control  all of the cars amy has driven in racing games have been oldfashioned convertibles similar to how sonic has driven sports cars and how knuckles drives offroaders amys last name rose can be considered a play on words a rose is a flower that is connected with love which can be related to her crush on sonic it is also a play on her color because in french rose translates to pink her fur color her first name amy could also be derived from the japanese word ame meaning candy related to amys cute personality but also rain which can be related to her quick changing temper and power when shes angry it could also be derived from the french name aimée which means beloved which also fits with her connection to love like blaze amy is a speed type character in the normal series but in the mario  sonic series and in sega superstars tennis she is an allaround type instead with the release of sonic the hedgehog 4 episode metal amy is the only major character from the classic games who is still around and who has yet to get her own game amy rose is one of four characters to appear in every sonic the hedgehog series racing game to date although in sonic advance amy cannot typically spin dash or spin jump when amy is forced into a ball amy lacks the standard spin animation and an unusual high pitched noise can be heard amy rose was one of lisa ortizs favorite roles to do voice work for amy is the only game character confirmed to use magic outside of the storybook series in hatsune miku project diva 2nd another sega video game amys iconic piko piko hammer is an unlockable item for kagamine rin where it is rins favorite item amy is one of the few speed types not to enhance her natural speed in any way amy is one of only two characters to appear on the tab for selecting sonic world for dream figure skating in mario  sonic at the olympic winter games the other being sonic amy being sonics selfproclaimed girlfriend is actually a mythology gag based on her counterpart amy the girlfriend of nicky from the 1992 manga her personality seems to be very similar to that of her counterpart as well while amy makes no appearance in sonic mania smaller robotic versions that resemble her are used by dr eggman during the boss fight of metallic madness zone against sonic tails and knuckles these robots try to approach the heroes in a similar way the real amy did with sonic in sonic the hedgehog cd except they explode upon contact references↑ naoto ohshima on
