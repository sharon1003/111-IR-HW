science  mathematics chemistry difference between frequency and intensityhey people i am an 11 class student and in if someone has read the chapter 2 of our chemistry atomic structure then in black body radiation it is said that the radiations emitted depend on frequency not on intensity but i have never understood the difference between frequency and intensity how intensity and show more4 following 18 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer frequency means no of cycles per second or in your case no of photons hitting per second intensity means no of photons hitting per unit area this implies radiations emitted will depend upon no of photons hitting per second and not upon no of photons hitting per unit areasurya · 10 years ago10 0 comment askers rating define frequency chemistry source shttpsshorteima8or tmarinelli · 1 year ago0 0 comment i am not familiar with your specific chapter 2 but i can explain this radiation from a hot surface is emitted as electromagnetic radiation the frequency and wavelength of the light given off are dependent on temperature and what the surface is made of intensity is a measure of energy per unit area say most of the radiation is in the ir which is true for most of the thermal radiation at normal temperatures that determines the frequency and wavelength the intensity is how much of that ir energy is coming off ir thermometers measure the intensity of one or two specific wavelengths in the ir spectrum and if calibrated for the emissivity of the surface provide an accurate measurement of the temperature of the surface it has to be corrected for emissivity because different materials give off ir energy differently some matls give it off easily so they do not have to be very hot to give off a certain intensity other matls will have to be at higher temperature to give off the same intensity hope this helps gary h · 10 years ago1 0 comment1 frequency is a measure of the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time it is also referred to as temporal frequency the period is the duration of one cycle in a repeating event so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency 2 in physics intensity is a measure of the timeaveraged energy flux the word intensity here is not synonymous with strength amplitude or level as it sometimes is in colloquial speech for example the intensity of pressure is meaningless since the parameters of those variables do not match to find the intensity take the energy density that is the energy per unit volume and multiply it by the velocity at which the energy is moving the resulting vector has the units of power divided by area ie wattm² it is possible to define the intensity of the water coming from a garden sprinkler but intensity is used most frequently with waves ie sound or light ajmsource s1 httpenwikipediaorgwikifrequency 2 httpenwikipediaorgwikiintensity anonymous · 10 years ago1 0 comment ill givea simply difference between intensity and frequency the amount of energy passing each second through unit area is called the intensity frequency is the number of oscillations per unit time 1 oscillation is described as the change in density from the maximum value to the minimum value again to the maximum value hope this helpsarjun · 10 years ago5 0 comment the frequency tells you the tone pitch which is a measure of the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time it is also referred to as temporal frequency the period is the duration of one cycle in a repeating event so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency the colloquial word intensity energy tells you the loudness of a sound in reality is meant the sound pressure level spl of the sound which is no energy prasad · 10 years ago0 0 comment frequency is the number of times an event happens intensity is the degree or strength of an event frequency measures repetitiveness intensity does not involve repetitiveness leigh · 2 years ago1 0 comment frequency  the number of occurrences within a given time period intensity  the amount of energy transmitted as by acoustic or electromagnetic radiationanonymous · 10 years ago0 0 comment you have probably got your answer by now all the answers given above are quite good i will try to add one point  in any wave propagation there are two factors viz the frequency of oscillation and the amplitude of the oscillation the frequency of oscillation indicates the energy contained and the intensity indicates the amplitudeashish · 10 years ago1 0 comment meaning of frequency is occurrence of a thing again and again after a set time ie after every five minutes or after every 1 kmso on meaning of intensity is the strength or power ie the switch has intensity of 3 kwrajendra s · 10 years ago0 0 comment frequency is the number of repetitions in a given time ie rate of recurrence and intensity means amount of quality the quality may be forcebrightness or anything else so you can now
