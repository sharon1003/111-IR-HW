the control function of management can be a critical determinant of organizational success most authors discuss control only through feedback and adjustment processes this article takes a broader perspective on control and discusses the following questions what is good control why are controls needed how can good control be achieved if multiple control strategies are feasible how should the choice among them be madeadvertisement after strategies are set and plans are made managements primary task is to take steps to ensure that these plans are carried out or if conditions warrant that the plans are modified this is the critical control function of management and since management involves directing the activities of others a major part of the control function is making sure other people do what should be done the management literature is filled with advice on how to achieve better control this advice usually includes a description of some type of measurement and feedback process the basic control process wherever it is found and whatever it is found and whatever it controls involves three steps 1 establishing standards 2 measuring performance against these standards and 3 correcting deviations from standards and plans 1a good management control system stimulates action by spotting the significant variations from the original plan and highlighting them for the people who can set things right 2controls need to focus on results 3this focus on measurement and feedback however can be seriously misleading in many circumstances a control system built around measurement and feedback is not feasible and even when feasibility is not a limitation use of a feedbackoriented control system is often an inferior solution yet good controls can be established and maintained using other techniques what is needed is a broader perspective on control as a management function this article addresses such a perspective the first part summarizes the general control problem by discussing the underlying reasons for implementing controls and by describing what can realistically be achieved in the second part the various types of controls available are identified the last part discusses why the appropriate choice of controls is and should be different in different settings why are controls needed if all personnel always did what was best for the organization control — and even management — would not be needed but obviously individuals are sometimes unable or unwilling to act in the organizations best interest and a set of controls must be implemented to guard against undesirable behavior and to encourage desirable actions one important class of problems against which control systems guard may be called personal limitations people do not always understand what is expected of them nor how they can best perform their jobs as they may lack some requisite ability training or information read the full article sign in buy as a pdf or create an account already a member sign in not a member sign up todaymember free3 free articles per month 650article thereafter free newsletter subscriber75yr usunlimited digital content quarterly magazine free newsletter entire archive about the author kenneth a merchant is assistant professor of business administration at harvard university dr merchant holds the b a degree from union college the m b a degree from columbia university and the ph d degree from the university of california berkeley his main interests lie in the areas of accounting information systems and planning and control dr merchant has published articles for such journals as the accounting review and accounting organizations and society
