planes of motion the human body may be broken down into sections in terms of three anatomical planes flat surfaces 1 these three planes are imaginary lines passing through the body in an anatomical position  which represent the dynamic planes of motion that the human body is capable of moving through 2contents  showsagittal plane lateral planethis is a vertical plane running from front to back that divides the body or any of its parts into sinister left and dexter right sides the two basic movements in the sagittal plane are flexion and extension 3midsagittal plane median planethis plane is in the midline — ie it would pass through midline structures such as the navel or spine and all other sagittal planes also referred to as parasagittal planes are parallel to it median can also refer to the midsagittal plane of other structures such as an appendage 4coronal plane frontal planethis is a vertical plane running from side to side that divides the body or any of its parts into anterior and posterior or dorsal and ventral parts the primary movements in the frontal plane are abduction movement of any part of the body in line with the frontal plane and adduction 3transverse plane horizontal or axial planethis is a horizontal plane that divides the body or any of its parts into upper and lower parts or superior and inferior most movement that occurs along this plane involve rotation movement that takes part of the body outward is called lateral or external rotation and movement that takes part of the body inward is called medial or internal rotation 3triplanar movement triplanar movement is any movement that occurs through all three planes of motion since most daily activities involves the use of all three planes of motion exercises that are triplanar are said to be more functional see also anatomical terms of location anatomical terms of motion references↑ unknown nd planes of the body training seer cancergov retrieved on 20080520↑ ron jones nd planes of motion ron jonesorg retrieved on 20080520↑ 30 31 32mike robertson nd functional anatomy for badasses part 1 tnationcom retrieved on 20080520↑ various nd anatomical terms of location wikipediaorg retrieved on 20080520 categories anatomy kinesiology
