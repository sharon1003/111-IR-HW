bottom line consider isolated peroneal neuropathy as the most likely cause of foot drop in patients with weakness of foot dorsiflexion and eversion sensory loss of the anterolateral aspect of the lower leg and the foot dorsum normal reflexes no pain swelling or erythema of the leg and no other neurological features offer conservative treatment in unilateral foot drop caused by isolated peroneal neuropathy but refer patients with acute bilateral foot drop one sided foot drop with fasciculations or more widespread neuropathy to a neurologist a 42 year old healthy female yoga instructor consults with frequent stumbling and numbness of the upper side of her left foot she has no pain or other symptoms what you should cover foot drop weakness of the dorsiflexion muscles in the foot is common causes difficulty in walking and greatly increases risk of falling spontaneous unilateral foot drop usually has a peripheral cause the lesion can be in the l5 nerve root sciatic nerve common peroneal nerve deep peroneal nerve or superficial peroneal nerve figure ⇓  the extent of the sensory or motor deficit depends on the location or level severity and duration of the injury or compression 1sites of pathology of the lower extremity that can lead to foot drop 1 l5 nerve root weakness of hip abduction gluteal muscles and pain and sensory loss in the side of the thigh and lower leg including the dorsum of the foot and toes iiii in addition to features in items 4 and 5 2 sciatic nerve pain in the back of the thigh and calf in addition to any of the features in items 4 and 5 depending on the site and severity of the lesion weakness of foot dorsiflexion and sometimes weakness of plantar flexors and knee flexors can occur sensory changes may be present in the foot sole dorsum and lateral lower leg the achilles’ tendon reflex may be reduced or absent 3 common peroneal nerve any of the features in items 4 and 5 4 deep peroneal nerve weakness of foot dorsiflexion

adapted with permission from manon project scientific illustrations download figure open in new tab download powerpoint the most common cause of spontaneous foot drop is peroneal neuropathy often as a result of compression at the neck of the fibula at knee level where the common peroneal nerve is covered only by skin and subcutaneous tissue less often foot drop is caused by l5 radiculopathy or polyneuropathy and much less often by sciatic neuropathies lumbar plexopathies mononeuritis multiplex or myopathies central causes such as cerebral ischaemia anterior horn cell diseases cauda equina compression and muscle dystrophy are rare and usually produce other symptoms 2medical history because external pressure is the most common cause of peroneal neuropathy ask about habitual leg crossing habitual or prolonged squatting or kneeling may be work related confinement to bed use of leg brace or recent plaster cast below the knee use of leg positioning or leg supports during recent surgery or other causes of compression at the fibular neck ask about other precipitating factors for peroneal mononeuropathy recent weight loss “slimmer’s palsy” overstretched peroneal nerve owing to ankle strain or prolonged leg stretching and masses in the popliteal space for example baker’s cysts check medical history for other causes of neuropathy or mononeuritis multiplex although these are less likely if symptoms are sudden or isolated such as diabetes alcohol misuse vitamin b 12 deficiency or chemotherapy exclude direct injury as a result of acute trauma such as fibula neck fracture or surgery hip arthroplasty can injure the sciatic nerve mimicking a peroneal neuropathy foot drop is usually seen immediately after injury but it appear after several days ask about other weakness or sensory problems of the leg s lower back or arms if foot drop is painless and not accompanied by other neurological symptoms it is almost always caused by peroneal mononeuropathy painful foot drop may suggest l5 radiculopathy trauma lumbar plexopathy or mononeuritis multiplex what you should do physical examination observe the patient’s gait a high stepping gait to prevent the foot from dragging is a sign of severe weakness of the dorsiflexion muscles examine the patient while he or she is walking on the heels and toes peroneal neuropathy will cause difficulty walking on the heel of the affected leg inspect the legs look for swelling and erythema which may be present after trauma and may suggest compartment syndrome look for fasciculations in legs and arms which can suggest a more extensive neurological problem such as motor neurone disease check for reduced pain pin prick sensation and light touch in the lower legs and feet sensory abnormalities only in the first web space suggest a deep peroneal nerve lesion whereas those only in the anterolateral aspect of the lower leg and the foot dorsum suggest a superficial peroneal nerve lesion figure assess strength of foot dorsiflexion and eversion peroneal nervefoot plantar flexion and inversion tibial nervehip abduction superior gluteal nerve l5 nerve root weakness of hip abduction may differentiate lumbar l5 radiculopathy from peroneal neuropathy no weakness with a positive predictive value of 95 and negative predictive value of 90 3check knee and achilles’ tendon reflexes and plantar response because hyperreflexia and babinski’s sign indicate an upper rather than lower motor neurone lesion palpate the course of the common peroneal nerve for local tenderness and tinel’s sign lightly tap over the nerve at the fibular head tingling or “pins and needles” in the nerve distribution indicates a lesion here check the popliteal space for masses and refer for imaging if necessary in isolated peroneal mononeuropathy only foot dorsiflexion or eversion or both will be weak reflexes will be normal and there will be no leg pain swelling or erythema consider electromyography or nerve conduction studies to confirm this working diagnosis advice and treatment refer immediately to a neurologist if foot drop is acute and bilateral or within one week if unilateral foot drop is accompanied by fasciculations or widespread neuropathy refer urgently to a surgeon if compartment syndrome is suspected if local nerve compression at the knee is the cause explain that this can cause weakness of the muscles that lift the foot and toes and thus foot drop or a “floppy foot” advise the patient to avoid leg crossing squatting and kneeling symptoms caused by these activities usually resolve in two to three months recommend flat shoes that support the ankles to prevent ankle sprain depending on the severity of foot drop and the patient’s condition consider an ankle foot orthosis to support the foot while walking and to reduce risk of falling consider physiotherapy for specific muscle training if weakness is severe ask the patient to return for review in two months and refer to a neurologist if the foot drop has not
