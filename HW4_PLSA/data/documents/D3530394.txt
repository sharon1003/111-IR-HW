uss enterprise in 2254the enterprise s first documented refit occurred sometime between 2254 and 2265 minor changes were made to the ships exterior most notably the impulse engines warp nacelles running lights and hull markings more substantial changes were made to the interior color scheme and layout of the ship a second more extensive refit occurred at some point after the crafts encounter with the galactic barrier in 2265 this refit involved replacing the bridge module a newer smaller deflector dish and refinements to the warp nacelles the ships interior was also upgraded the new bridge module included consoles with triangular and circular resin buttons as well as whitecolored rocker flip switches there was another small refit sometime in early 2266 too the whitecolored rocker flip switches seen on bridge consoles and on various places on the ship were replaced with multicolored rocker flip switches in the late 2260s a new bridge module added a second turbolift and the design moved toward a completely smooth circular configuration both standard features on future starships at the same time the translucent overhead dome was obscured not to return until the galaxy class bridge  tas  beyond the farthest star at the end of its fiveyear mission the enterprise returned to earth in 2270 following its success the ship had become a recognized symbol of starfleet and the federation starfleets array of unique assignment patches were abandoned for the universal adoption of the enterprise delta symbol previously used on the assignment patch for the uss kelvin  star trek the stalwart vessel itself was by then twentyfive years old and returning from a deployment that included an unprecedented number of warpspeed records hull pounding battles and framestressing maneuvers the refitted enterprise in spacedock 2270s system upgrades with new technologies after long deployments were far from unusual in the ships history however the enterprise s overhaul of the early 2270s became a nearly keelup redesign and reconstruction project the very heart of the ship was replaced with a radically different vertical warp core assembly linked to new and heavier warp engine nacelles atop sweptback pylons and integrated with the impulse engines the new drive system allowed for an expanded cargo hold in the secondary hull linked to the shuttlebay  weapons system upgrades included nine dual phaser banks with power channeled directly from the warp engines a double photon torpedo probe launcher was installed atop the secondary hull multiple egress points now included a port side spacedock hatch dual ventral space walk bays four dorsal service hatches and a standardized docking ring port aft of the bridge on the primary hull four more docking ring ports paired on the port and starboard sides of the launcher and secondary hulls respectively and service hatch airlocks on the port and starboard sides of the hangar bays main clamshell doors a new bridge module reflected the modern computer systems operating interfaces and ergonomics that ran throughout the ship following kirks promotion to rear admiral and posting as chief of starfleet operations his successor captain will decker whom kirk himself picked to succeed him oversaw the refit assisted by chief engineer commander montgomery scott  after 18 months in spacedock for refit the enterprise was pressed into service weeks ahead of schedule in response to the vger crisis once again under kirks command making contact with vger decker was temporarily demoted to commander and posted as executive officer because of his familiarity with the new design incomplete systems had to be serviced during the vessels shakedown cruise en route to vger including the first test of the new warp engines shortly after launch a matter antimatter intermix malfunction ruptured the warp field and led to the enterprise entering into an unstable wormhole commander decker belayed an order from admiral kirk to destroy an asteroid in their path which had been dragged into the ruptured warp field along with them with phasers the refitted phasers now channeled power directly from the main engines at a point beyond the dilithiummagnatomicinitiator stage because of this refitted function the intermix malfunction and the antimatter imbalance within the warp nacelles that had resulted caused automatic cutoff of the phasers a design change of which kirk had not been aware decker ordered the use of photon torpedoes instead as a backup they had been designed to draw power from a separate system in case of a major phaser loss the timely arrival of commander spock brought correction to the intermix problem  star trek the motion picture once the vger threat was averted captain decker was listed as missing in action and the enterprise remained under admiral kirks command for an interim period at some point kirk passed command on to captain spock the new designs and components tested and proven aboard the enterprise influenced a generation of starship design from the miranda class to the constellation class as well as other retrofitted constitution s  star trek ii the wrath of khan final days edit in 2285 the enterprise was in a lowtempo training cycle based in the sol system admiral kirk boarded his old command to observe a cadet training cruise  meanwhile khan noonien singh had escaped from his exile on ceti alpha v and hijacked the uss reliant leading to his theft of the genesis device from the regula i space station  the enterprise heavily damaged the enterprise was tasked to investigate and spock deferred his command to admiral kirk subsequent engagements with reliant left the ship badly damaged with cadet and crew deaths including captain spock  star trek ii the wrath of khan  my god bones what have i done   admiral james t kirk upon the enterprise returning to earth starfleet commander in chief admiral harry morrow announced that the starship at that point forty years old would be decommissioned when morrow denied kirk requesting permission to return to the mutara sector kirk conspired with his senior officers and stole the enterprise from earth spacedock in order to recover spocks body from the genesis planet – to bring it and spocks katra the latter possessed by leonard mc coy to vulcan as part of the plan kirk had scott rig up an automation system to run the enterprise so easily that a chimpanzee and two trainees could have handled the craft the enterprise burning in genesis atmosphere at the enterprise s destination the ship was attacked by a klingon birdofprey operated by klingon commander kruge an assault that left the enterprise disabled scottys automation system was not designed for combat and overloaded when the ship was attacked after setting the autodestruct sequence kirk and his crew abandoned the ship for the surface of the genesis planet demolition charges in place in the bridge and elsewhere throughout the ships saucer section exploded killing a klingon boarding party the secondary hull with what was left of the saucer fell from orbit and blazingly streaked across the planets atmosphere  star trek iii the search for spock film writer harve bennett justified the destruction of the enterprise via an analogy to the uss niagara according to bennett  oliver hazard perry of the u s navy scuttled the niagra sic at the battle of lake erie and won the battle as a result and took command  he added  perry happens to be one of james t kirks great heroes so the scuttling of the ship to achieve the greater good is a tactic   great birds of the galaxy gene roddenberry and the creators of trek there is a difference in the appearance of the enterprise between star trek ii the wrath of khan and star trek iii the search for spock in star trek iii the ships external appearance appeared to have deteriorated around some areas damaged by khans attacks and repaired in others while other areas of the ship that had not been damaged by khans attack had battle damage including the starboard secondary hull both nacelles and the top of the saucer this extra damage was explained in noncanon star trek literature as having occurred in spars with klingon warships between the second and third movies the aggressive move to attack the enterprise was explained by the secrecy of the genesis planet and the overall uneasiness it created this could also explain the klingon aggressiveness displayed throughout the third movie 2crew edit the crew of the uss enterprise enjoy a jovial moment list of uss enterprise
