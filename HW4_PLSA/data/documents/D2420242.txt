immune antibody also found in dictionary thesaurus encyclopedia antibody  an´tĭbod″e an immunoglobulin molecule having a specific amino acid sequence that gives each antibody theability to adhere to and interact only with the antigen that induced its synthesis this antigenspecific property of the antibody is the basis of the antigenantibody reaction that is essential to an immune response the antigenantibody reaction begins as soon as substances interpreted as foreign invaders gain entrance into the body see also immunity abbreviated ab antibodies are synthesized by the plasma cells formed when antigenspecific groups  clones of b lymphocytes respond to the presence of antigen the developmental process of antibody productionbegins when stem cells are transformed into b lymphocytes this transformation usually is completed a few months after birth at which time the lymphocytes migrate to lymphoid tissueprimarily located in the lymph nodes although they are also found in the spleen gastrointestinaltract and bone marrow antibody production its interaction with a specific antigen and the activation of complement c an interrelated group of eleven proteins are the major components of the humoral system of immunity antibodymediated immunity from applegate 2000 fortunately the immune response of antibody and complement can be transferred passively fromone individual to another as for example the transfer of maternal antibody across the placentalbarrier to the fetus who has not yet developed a mature immune system an antibody present in an individual without known prior exposure to the corresponding red cell antigen is termed an isoagglutinin examples are the abo antibodies antia antib and antiab antibodies can be classified according to their mode of action as they react to and set aboutdefending the body against foreign invaders some cause clumping together of bacterial cells  agglutination and are called agglutinins those antibodies that cause bacterial cells to dissolve or liquefy are called bacteriolysins this activity is assisted by complement which interacts with theantigenantibody complex in such a way that the cell ruptures and there is dissolution  lysis of thecell body opsonins coat the outside of bacteria making them more attractive to phagocytes othertypes of antibodies include those that neutralize the toxins of antigens  antitoxins and those thatcause precipitation of antigens in a fluid medium  precipitins anaphylactic antibody a substance formed as a result of the first injection of a foreignanaphylactogen and responsible for the anaphylactic symptoms following the second injection of the same anaphylactogenantinuclear as ana autoantibodies directed against components of the cell nucleus egdna rna and histones they may be detected by immunofluorescence a positive ana test is characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus antinuclear antibodies also occur in patientswith rheumatoid arthritis sjögrens syndrome and sclerodermablocking antibody any antibody that by combining with an antigen blocks another immunologicreaction with the antigen immunotherapy hypersensitization for allergic disorders induces in most treated patients ig g blocking antibodies that can bind the allergen and prevent it frombinding to cellfixed ig e and trigger immediate hypersensitivity thus it can induce partialimmunologic tolerance

antibody the antibody is made in response to tumor cells injected into mice and is produced from mouse serum monoclonal antibodies may be used alone unconjugated or bound conjugated to radioisotopes
