inventionthe present invention relates to a novel and useful surgery table which is especially useful for positioning a patient for spinal surgery a standard surgery table is generally unsatisfactory for the performance of spinal surgery procedures such as lumbar laminectomies decompressions and fusions to perform such techniques a patient is best positioned in the prone sitting position in addition radiographic images are usually taken with the patient in the prone kneeling position which is especially critical for pedicle screw fixations in the past the andrews spinal surgery frame has been employed as an accessory to standard operating tables in order to properly position a patient for spinal surgery although the andrews frame has been the standard spinal surgery accessory is often difficult to adapt the andrews frame to the variety of standard surgery tables in addition it often requires several persons to position the patient on the andrews frame especially into the prone sitting position moreover radiological images are not easily obtained with the andrews frame and a standard spinal surgery table u s pat no 4662619 describes an improved kneeling attachment to the andrews frame u s pat no 4718077 describes a radiolucent table which is useful with a carm fluoroscope the spinal surgery table designated the sst3000 manufactured by orthopedic systems inc partially integrates the features of the andrews frame and a standard surgery table although still requiring multiple persons to manipulate the patient into an operative position a surgery table which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior spinal surgery frames would be a great advance in the medical field summary of the inventionin accordance with the present invention a novel and useful spinal surgery table is herein provided the spinal surgery table of the present invention utilizes a frame member which includes means for supporting the frame member on a ground surface frame member may include a first section extending laterally relative to the platform and a second section also extending laterally relative to the platform a member connects a first and second sections and is offset from the centers from the first and second sections the connecting member may be positioned at a lower level than portions of the first and second sections such offset and lowered connecting member is especially useful in permitting employment of a carm xray imager with the patient in either the prone kneeling or prone sitting position casters may be attached to the frame to permit rolling of the frame on the ground surface the frame member connects to a platform which supports the patient undergoing surgery such platform may be disposed at the terminus of a pedestal which is vertically movable to determine the height of a platform above the ground surface in addition to the lateral tilt trendelenberg and leg position adjustments the table of the present invention provides for the patient supporting platform having a laterally movable portion such laterally movable portion may ride along an axis of the spinal surgery table an arm support may also be found in the present invention and is connected to the laterally movable portion of the platform for concomitant motion in addition the arm support may rotate inwardly and outwardly relative to the platform the surgery table is also constructed with a torso support which externalizes in a carriage supported by the platform and is connected to the laterally movable portion thereof the torso support further possesses a torso lift mechanism for raising and lowering the torso of the patient relative to the platform in this regard a hydraulic mechanism utilizing a hydraulic cylinder travels laterally with the carriage of the torso support mechanism and thus with the laterally movable portion of the platform the surgery table of the present invention further employs a leg support which is found in articulated relationship with the platform the leg support has as one of its elements a tibial support and means for vertically adjusting the tibial support relative to the platform also the leg support includes means for rotating the leg support relative to the platform which essentially serves as a foot end adjustment the leg support rotating means is motivated with a hydraulic mechanism
