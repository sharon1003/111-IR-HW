be in a relationship in a future 122powers and abilities powers kryptonian physiology under the effects of a yellow sun kara possesses the same potential powers as an average kryptonian these include solar energy absorption under optimal conditions this is the main source of karas super powers as they are contingent upon exposure to solar radiation from a yellow sun star system her biological make up includes a number of organs which lack analogues in humans and whose functions are unknown it is believed that between one or more of these and her biocellular matrix yellow solar energy is stored for later use this allows for the use of these powers to fade when yellow solar radiation is not available instead of immediate failure heat vision kara can as a conscious act fire beams of intense heat at a target by looking at it she can vary the heat and area affected superhearing karas hearing is sensitive enough to hear any sound at any volume or pitch with skill and concentration she can block out ambient sounds to focus on a specific source or frequency enhanced vision karas vision processes the entire electromagnetic spectrum as well as allowing vast control over selective perception and focus this umbrella ability includes the following electromagnetic spectrum vision kara can see well into most of the electromagnetic spectrum she can see and identify radio and television signals as well as all other broadcast or transmitted frequencies using this ability she can avoid detection by radar or satellite monitoring methods this also allows her to see the aura generated by living thing telescopic vision this is the ability to see something at a great distance without violating the laws of physics though limited the exact extent of the ability is undetermined in function it is similar to the zoom lens on a camera xray vision this is the ability to see through any volume of matter except lead karas can see things behind a solid opaque object as if it were not there she can focus this ability to peel back layers of an object allowing hidden image or inner workings to be observed the exact type of energy perceived  such as xrays cosmic rays or some other energy invisible to normal humans  is unclear this ability perceives an ambient energy source though it does not involve the eye projecting a concentrated possibly toxic beam to be reflected back from objects microscopic vision this is the ability to see extremely small objects and images down to the atomic level infrared vision kara can see with better acuity in darkness and to a degree in total darkness flight kara is able to manipulate graviton particles to defy the forces of gravity and achieve flight this ranges from hovering to moving in any posture in any direction invulnerability due to the interaction of her dense molecular structure and supercharged bioelectric aura kara is nighinvulnerable to extreme energy forces in addition her extends this protection against toxins and diseases superhuman stamina kara is able to maintain continuous strenuous physical action for an indefinite period of time this based on her body converting yellow solar radiation directly to energy but is limited by physiological and psychological needs to eat drink and sleep superhuman strength karas strength is augmented by yellow solar radiation interacting with the greater than human density resilience and biological efficiency of her musculature her strength is more an act of conscious will on energy fields than actual physical strength it is this act of conscious will that enables her to perform physical feats that are beyond the mere application force such as moving a mountain top without said rock crumbling under its own mass superhuman speed kara is able to move at incredible speed by sheer force of will this extends to her perceptions and allows for feats such as catching bullets in mid flight as well as covering vast distances in little or no time this also confers superhuman agility superhuman reflexes superbreath kara is able to create hurricane force winds by exhaling air from her lungs she can chill the air as it leaves her lungs to freeze targets she can also reverse the process to pull large volumes of air or vapor into her lungs longevity sonic screams in order to get out of a trap created by cyborg superman kara disrupted the frequency of the machine by screaming at a certain frequency 123abilities handtohand combat advanced kara was taught how to fight in krypton as part of her trials 124 and in crucible academy 125multilingualism kara can speak fluent english and kryptonian she has been studying all earths languages but she thinks she is bad at most of them 126genius level intellect weaknesses kryptonian physiology under the effects of a yellow sun kara possesses the same potential weaknesses as an average kryptonian these include vulnerability to kryptonite vulnerability to magic vulnerability to sensory overload supergirls sensitive sense can be overpowered such as when lobo tossed a sonic grenade under her feet and knocked her unconscious 127  128solar energy dependancy paraphernalia weapons red lantern ring
