cystic fibrosis marie m budev atul c mehta published august 2010contents cystic fibrosis cf is the most common classic mendelian autosomal recessive lifelimiting disease among the white population 12 it is a multisystem disease that results from loss of function in the cf transmembrane conductance regulator  cftr gene classically leading to respiratory tract gastrointestinal gi pancreatic and reproductive abnormalities 2 cf was recognized as a distinct clinical entity in 1938 and was believed to be invariably fatal during infancy 3since the 1970s the life spans of cf patients have been prolonged with advances in early diagnosis care and disease therapy early diagnosis has been improved by newborn screening advances in care include management of meconium ileus and improved methods of sputum clearance and managing respiratory failure improvements in disease therapy include better antibiotics especially macrolides and better pancreatic enzymes with current management almost 80 of patients with cf will reach adulthood thus cf is no longer a purely pediatric disease 46 for patients born in the 1990s the median survival is predicted to be greater than 40 years 5 as more cf patients are surviving longer adult issues including careers relationships and family are becoming important 6 a range of comorbid conditions that are more prevalent in adult cf patients are also being encountered with increasing frequency as this population matures including osteoporosis diabetes joint diseases malnutrition severe lung disease with bronchiectasis colonization by resistant pathogens severe gastric reflux chronic sinusitis and periportal fibrosis 7delivery of health care to the cf patient is now relevant to the nonpediatric physician in fact the multifaceted needs of the adult cf patient have led to the development of a nationwide network of more than 83 adult cf care programs in conjunction with the cystic fibrosis foundation 8 these comprehensive cf centers provide patients with a multidisciplinary approach based on the original pediatric cf centers the aims of adult cf care include delivery of optimum care access to pertinent medical resources coordination of care among specialists and primary care providers and a strong emphasis on independence and improving the quality of life of the patient who has cf 5 the physician is also faced with another challenge in which the adult cf patient presents with atypical features that might have gone unrecognized in this chapter we cover the salient features of cf including prevalence and the issues surrounding neonatal screening pathophysiology diagnosis and new and emerging therapies for this complex multisystem disease definition cf is a genetic disease affecting approximately 30000 children and adults in the united states a defective gene causes the body to produce an abnormally thick sticky mucus that leads to airway obstruction subsequent lifethreatening lung infections endstage lung disease and bronchiectasis these thick secretions also obstruct the pancreas preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestines leading to pancreatic insufficiency malabsorption and in extreme cases malnutrition back to top prevalence ethnicity cf is a disease that occurs predominantly in the white population with a rate of one in 2500 live births two percent to 5 of whites are carriers of the cftr gene mutation having one normal and one abnormal gene but have no overt clinical signs of disease cf is not rare in african american populations but it occurs at the much lower frequency of approximately one in 17000 live births 9 in general mutations of the cf gene are most prevalent in persons of northern and central european ancestries or of ashkenazi jewish descent and they are rarely found in native americans asians or native africans 10 although the prevalence of cf is lower in the african american population the mean age at diagnosis is younger in black patients than in white patients overall the clinical manifestations are similar in both racial groups except that black patients tend to have more severe gi issues including poor nutritional status 10 there are more than 23000 patients with cf in the united states 6gender cf occurs equally often in male and female patients in general female patients with cf fare significantly worse than male patients female patients become infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa earlier and have worse pulmonary function worse nutritional status and earlier mortality 1113 a cystic fibrosis registry analysis from the university of wisconsin 14 demonstrated that cf is diagnosed in girls at a later age than boys by at least 4 months or even later when the analysis was limited to children presenting with only respiratory symptoms 407 months for diagnosis in girls vs 223 months for diagnosis in boys implications for disease outcomes caused by delayed diagnosis of cf in girls may be present based on this recent analysis but the reason for this delay is not clear or obvious 15back to top pathophysiology cf is an autosomal recessive trait caused by mutations at a single gene locus on the long arm of chromosome 7 the gene product cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr is a 1480amino acid polypeptide 1617 cf reflects the loss of function of the cftr protein the cftr protein normally regulates the transport of electrolytes and chloride across epithelial cell membranes 18more than 1000 mutations of the cftr gene have been described 19 the most common mutations of cftr can be classified into six groups based on their known functional consequences 20 this classification allows categorization of cftr mutations based on molecular mechanisms but phenotypic appearance depends on the type of mutation class location of the gene molecular mechanism and interaction with other mutations as well as genetic and environmental influences 21the most common mutation of the cftr gene is caused by deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 δf508 and occurs with varying frequency in different ethnic groups 22 worldwide this allele is responsible for approximately 66 of all cf chromosomes 23back to top screening about 1000 infants are born with cf every year cf is diagnosed in most of these children at a mean age of 3 to 4 years 24 nearly 10 of cf patients receive their diagnosis when they are older than 18 years newborn screening for cf has been instituted in eight states but national screening plans have not been mandated in all cf is diagnosed in 10 of infants in the united states either by prenatal diagnosis 3 or by newborn screening 7 25 newborn cf screening has been advocated by clinicians and cf groups as an early means of identifying asymptomatic patients so as to initiate early therapy to prevent longterm sequelae of the disease 26 the currently available genetic screening tools for cf include the guthrie test in which measurements of the immunoreactive trypsinogen in dried blood are taken and measurement of the most common cf mutations including δf508 26 δf508 is the most commonly reported gene mutation and is responsible for 70 of the mutated alleles in white patients it is caused by a 3bp deletion in the cftr gene resulting in the loss of the amino acid at position 508 of the cftr protein homozygosity of this mutation is severe resulting in both pulmonary and pancreatic disease 27recommendations for carrier screening or population screening have been proposed by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists the national institutes of health and the american college of medical genetics they are designed to identify atrisk couples before the birth of a child with cf 28 screening should be offered to adults with a family history of cf reproductive partners of persons with cf and white including ashkenazi jewish patients who are planning pregnancy screening should be made available to persons of color the efficacy of cf screening program is based on a multitude of factors one factor is identification of the cf carrier status of each partner which helps to determine the risk to the fetus issues to keep in mind include the gestational age at which the couple presents for prenatal care and the feasibility of pregnancy termination these factors should be included in the cf screening discussion with parents the screening of couples can follow two approaches the female partner is screened first and if she tests positive for cf carrier status then the male partner is tested or both partners are screened concurrently to use time efficiently for decision making especially if more than one recessive disorder is being considered important information to discuss with patients before screening include the aim of screening the voluntary nature of screening medical and genetic issues surrounding cf the prevalence of cf the interpretation of the test results and individual values 29carrier screening neither detects all mutations that could be present nor estimates the residual risk the chance that the patient still carries a copy of a cftr mutation despite negative testing cf is an autosomal recessive disorder and persons with cf typically have inherited one mutated allele from each parent it is very rare to inherit two mutated alleles from one parent and none from the other 2930for couples who have one child with cf or who are known to be carriers prenatal diagnosis of cf is available through chorionic villus sampling in the first trimester or by amniocentesis in the second or third trimester some patients undergo prenatal testing to help in deciding to terminate or continue the pregnancy back to top signs and symptoms signs and symptoms of cf are listed in box 1

p 3801 © 2005 the cleveland clinic foundation respiratory inflammation and infections because the epithelial cells of an organ are affected by a variety of cftr mutations the consequences of the mutation vary depending on the organ involved the pathologic changes differ in the secretory cells sinuses lungs pancreas liver or reproductive tract the hallmark of cf and the cause of death in more than 90 of patients is chronic pulmonary disease caused by bacterial and viral pathogens and leading to a host inflammatory response the most profound changes occur in the lungs and airways where chronic infections involve a limited number of organisms including p aeruginosa which is implicated most often followed by staphylococcus aureus haemophilus influenzae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia 6 children with cf are first infected with staphylococcus and haemophilus species and later with pseudomonas species several theories have been proposed to explain the limited number of organisms involved in cf pulmonary infections including the inflammationfirst hypothesis 31 the infectionfirst hypothesis 32 the cellreceptor hypothesis 17 and the salt defensins hypothesis 33 the salt defensins hypothesis proposes that cf airway cells have properties similar to those of sweat glands that inactivate substances called defensins leading to bacterial multiplication and infections these theories however do not explain the presence of mucoid s aureus or mucoidtype p aeruginosa the isotonic fluid depletion and anoxic mucus theory proposes that water and volumedepleted airway fluid leads to mucus viscosity subsequent defective ciliary clearance and a cough that is inadequate to clear the airways thus bacteria in the cf lung are trapped within this viscous airway fluid and multiply within anaerobic growth conditions by changing from a nonmucoid to a mucoid type of organism 3436 the transformation of these bacteria to a biofilmencased form is a means of protection from normal host defenses and antibiotics making eradication difficult 37 a neutrophildominated airway inflammation is certainly present in cf lung disease even in clinically stable patients 3138it seems that early pediatric colonization with either p aeruginosa or s aureus has a significant impact on cf lung disease in adulthood another organism unique to cf with a significant impact on adult cf lung disease is burkholderia cepacia earlier this organism was uniformly associated with poor clinical outcomes but now it is recognized that outcomes might depend on the actual genotype of the organism 39clinically cf pulmonary exacerbations are manifested as an increase in respiratory symptoms including cough and sputum production with associated systemic symptoms that include malaise and anorexia 40 patients rarely have fever and leukocytosis and in most cases radiographic changes are minimal during an exacerbation 9 an exacerbation can be documented by a decrease in pulmonary function which usually returns to normal after the acute exacerbation resolves as the lung disease progresses bronchiolitis and bronchitis become evident with bronchiectasis as a consequence of the persistent obstructioninfection insult overall bronchiectasis in cf is more severe in the upper lobes than in the lower lobes pathologic examinations have demonstrated bronchiectatic cysts in more than 50 of endstage cf lung on autopsy studies 41 subpleural cysts often occur in the upper lobes and can contribute to the frequent occurrence of pneumothorax in patients with latestage cf the reported incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax in cf ranges between 28 and 189 42 the patient with spontaneous pneumothorax usually presents with acute onset of chest pain or dyspnea in one study chest pain was the manifesting symptom in more than 50 of patients dyspnea occurred in more than 65 of patients 43 in the same study hemoptysis was present in 19 of patients probably as a result of bronchial artery enlargement and subsequent tortuosity within ectatic airways made vessels delicate and more prone to bleed 44children without a prior established diagnosis of cf often present with cough and upper respiratory tract infections that persist longer than expected patients whose cf is diagnosed when they are older often do not have the underlying pancreatic insufficiency that is typical of the younger patient with classic cf patients with cf diagnosed in adulthood usually present with chronic respiratory infections but these are usually milder and less likely to be pseudomonal 42several interstitial lung diseases have been described during autopsy of the cf lung including the usual interstitial pneumonitis bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage 45 the upper respiratory tract is also involved in cf most patients suffer from acute and chronic sinusitis caused by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the secretory components of the sinus tract 46 another common feature is the presence of pedunculated nasal polyps 47 sleepdisordered breathing and nocturnal hypoxia mainly during rapideyemovement rem sleep and hypoventilation have also been described in cf patients 48gastrointestinal tract gi symptoms in cf manifest early and continue throughout the life span of a cf patient because of defects in cftr meconium ileus can occur at birth and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome the meconium ileus equivalent occurs in 40 of older cf patients the distal intestinal obstruction syndrome has been associated with inadequate use of pancreatic enzyme and dietary indiscretion without appropriate use of pancreatic enzyme 9 cf patients with obstruction can present with abdominal pain and often a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant on physical examination associated symptoms include anorexia nausea vomiting and obstipation with more frequent events adhesions can develop due to inflammation leading to a mechanically dysfunctional intestine that can eventually require surgical resection as a result of the cftr defect the biliary ducts can become plugged and clogged leading to liver involvement and biliary cirrhosis in 25 of patients with cf hepatic steatosis can result from malnutrition and congestion can result from hypoxiainduced cor pulmonale 2 symptomatic liver disease with the sequelae of cirrhosis including esophageal varices is uncommon fecal loss of bile acids is increased in cf leading to a reduction in the bile salt pool and a propensity for cholelithiasis approximately 30 of adult cf patients present with a hypoplastic poorly functioning gallbladder and about one third of that population develops gallstones 4950about 90 of patients with cf have pancreatic insufficiency it is believed to be related to reduced volumes of pancreatic secretions and reduced concentrations of bicarbonate excretion as a result digestive proenzymes are retained when the pancreatic duct is blocked leading to organ tissue destruction and fibrosis lipids and fatsoluble vitamins d e k and a are therefore malabsorbed and the malabsorption can eventually lead to a hypermetabolic state and increased endobronchial infections because of an inverse relation between metabolic states and lung function in cf patients 51 patients with no evidence of pancreatic insufficiency usually manifest milder disease and are less likely to have the δf508 mutation 9cfrelated diabetes usually develops after the second decade of life and rarely before the age of 10 years due to sparing of langerhans cells over time pancreatic destruction and fibrosis occur caused by obstruction of the pancreatic ducts and later leading to amyloid deposition and diabetes ensues 5253 patients with cfrelated diabetes experience more severe lung disease and nutritional deficiencies than cf patients without diabetes bone disease including osteoporosis and osteopenia is multifactorial in cf because of malnutrition cytokines and hormonal disorders in androgen hypogonadism and estrogen production and because of glucocorticoid therapy 54fertility and reproduction now that many more cf patients are surviving into their 40s issues of family and children have gained more attention most male cf patients are infertile because of aspermia secondary to atretic or bilateral absence of the vas deferens or seminal vesicle abnormalities 55 it is believed that during fetal life the vas deferens becomes plugged with mucoid secretions and subsequently gets reabsorbed libido and sexual performance are not affected artificial insemination may be used for couples desiring offspring by obtaining microscopic epididymal sperm sampling female cf patients usually have normal reproductive tracts although the cervical mucus may be tenacious as a result of cftr mutation thus blocking the cervical canal and possibly interfering with fertility overall women with cf are not as infertile as their male counterparts and birth control must be discussed with female patients reaching sexual maturity 56 the endometrium and fallopian tubes contain very small amounts of cftr and usually remain normal 57 onset of menarche is usually normal except in girls who are severely ill and undernourished since the 1960s the prognosis for cf and pregnancy has improved greatly maternal deaths usually occur in women with the most severe lung disease it appears from multiple case studies that the decline of lung function and the absolute value of the fev 1 may be more important in determining fetal outcome 5859 one study by canny and colleagues recommended an fev 1 of greater than 70 as a requirement for a successful pregnancy outcome 59 normal lung function leads to a normal pregnancy pulmonary status can worsen in women with poor lung function during pregnancy but this is still debated termination of pregnancy has been recommended if the fev 1 is less than 50 however reports do exist of successful pregnancies with low fev 1 60 extremes of low body weight have resulted in terminations and premature deliveries and may be a relative contraindication 61 in terms of infant health it should be kept in mind that all infants will be carriers of a maternal gene for cf case reports have reported fetal anomalies caused either by treatment by maternal complications or by chance itself 57vaginal yeast infections and urinary incontinence have now become major issues in female cf patients as they mature many patients have persistent yeast infections as a result of frequent antibiotic therapy suppression of cough in an attempt to prevent urinary leak can prevent women from aggressively continuing chest physiotherapy 6263sweat glands during the great summer heat wave of 1939 it was discovered that patients with cf were especially susceptible to heat prostration and associated cardiovascular collapse and death after initial symptoms this sweat defect was discovered by di santagnese and eventually led to the modern day sweat test used in the diagnosis of cf in the sweat duct cftr is the only channel by which chloride can be reabsorbed from sweat 6364back to top diagnosis in 1998 the cystic fibrosis foundation issued a consensus statement regarding the diagnosis of cf 1 according to the panel the diagnosis of cf should be made on the basis of one or more characteristic phenotypic features history of a cf sibling presence of a positive newborn screening test and laboratory confirmation of a cftr abnormality by an abnormal sweat chloride test identification of mutations in a gene known to cause cf or in vivo demonstration of an ion transport abnormality across the nasal epithelium  figure 1  however if these classic criteria as described by the committee are not present cf still cannot be ruled out in its entirety in patients who present later in childhood or in early adulthood these classic criteria might not be present in these patients typical pulmonary symptoms or gi symptoms may be absent and instead pancreatitis male infertility or sinusitis or nasal polyps may be present 18figure 1 click to enlarge sweat testing sweat testing in which a minimally acceptable volume or weight of sweat ≥50 mg must be collected during a 30minute period to ensure an average sweat rate of 1 gm 2 per minute using the gibson and cooke method 6364 a sweat chloride reading of more than 60 mmoll on repeated analysis is consistent with a diagnosis of cf but must be interpreted in the context of the patients history clinical presentation and age 1 approximately 5 of patients with cf have normal sweat test results 7 a negative sweat test does not rule out the possibility of cf in the presence of appropriate symptoms and clinical signs pancreatitis sinus disease and azoospermia and should be repeated false positives can result for many reasons but poor technique and patient nutritional status including anorexia can yield false results nasal potential measurements voltage nasal potential measurements measure the voltage difference and correlate with the movement of sodium across the cell membrane in cf the cftr mutation renders this physiologic function abnormal leading to a large drop in the potential in patients with cf the presence of nasal polyps or irritated nasal mucosa can yield a falsenegative result overall testing using this method is complicated and time consuming 65genotyping because of the more than 1000 cftr mutations associated with cf commercially available probes test only for a limited number of mutations which constitute more than 90 of the most common mutations known to cause cf but which can vary from region to region a mutation can be found in most symptomatic patients but in a small percentage the mutation can be absent 66 therefore clinical manifestations or family history are important to the diagnosis if an abnormality does exist the combination of two cf mutations plus an abnormal sweat chloride test is accepted for diagnosis mutation analysis can be used not only to confirm diagnosis but also to provide genetic information for family members predict certain phenotypic features and possibly help in allocating patients for research trials ancillary testing in patients with atypical features a number of clinical and radiologic tests may be performed to assess for a cf phenotype including assessment of respiratory tract microbiology chest radiographs computed tomography of the chest sinus evaluation genital tract evaluation semen analysis and pancreatic functional assessment the hallmarks of cf are pancreatic insufficiency and malabsorption which can lend themselves to laboratory examination such as measurement of serum trypsinogen or pancreasspecific elastase and fecal fat analysis or reduced fecal concentration of chymotrypsin 6768 in addition pansinusitis is so common in cf patients and generally uncommon in noncf children that the presence of this entity on examination and sinus radiographs should prompt a suspicion of cf 69 in a male patient with obstructive azoospermia confirmed with testicular biopsy cf should be strongly considered although other diseases such as youngs syndrome can cause pulmonary disease and azoospermia 70airway inflammation even in the absence of active infection is present in young and older patients with cf therefore bronchoalveolar lavage bal can show a predominance of neutrophils in patients with cf in atypical presentations with no evidence of pulmonary disease a bal with evidence of a high neutrophil count can provide further support for the diagnosis of cf in the presence of azoospermia or pancreatic disease 47 isolation of the mucoid type of p aeruginosa by bal or sputum analysis oropharyngeal swab or sinus culture is highly suggestive of cf 1back to top treatment gene treatment the cure for cf is to restore the function of cftr this has been attempted with in vivo gene therapy in cf patients using adenoviral vectors and cationic liposome transfer although lasting physiologic effects have not been noted 7172 although it is still far from being a standard treatment gene therapy for cf has been making significant strides protein modification is based on the concept that the abnormal cftr protein can be taught to transport water and electrolytes the cftr δf508 protein mutation is the most common mutation responsible for cf this abnormal mutation is recognized by the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded rather than glycosylated and transported to the cell surface aminoglycosides including gentamicin allow few of the cftr mutations to reach the respiratory epithelial cells in patients with cf other compounds including phenylbutyrate phenybutyrate and genistein have been tested to act as similar chaperones to the cftr mutation 7376another ongoing approach includes gene transfer in which both endogenous stem cells in the lung and mousederived cells have been noted to transform into airway and epithelial cells after systemic adminstration 77symptomatic treatment since the early 1990s the cystic fibrosis foundation has developed guidelines to help guide the care of patients with this complex disease  table 1  1table 1 cystic fibrosis foundation guidelines for cystic fibrosis care care frequency outpatient visits 4yr pulmonary function tests ≥2yr respiratory cultures ≥1yr creatinine level 1yr glucose 1yr for patients 13 yr liver enzymes 1yr adapted from cystic fibrosis foundation cystic fibrosis foundation patient registry annual data report 2002 bethesda md cystic fibrosis foundation 2003 respiratory care respiratory disease is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in cf all patients with cf should be monitored for changes in respiratory disease a persistent cough in a cf patient is not normal and the cause should be aggressively pursued spirometry is a useful tool for monitoring pulmonary status initial lung function in most cf patients is normal later the small peripheral airways become obstructed leading to changes on spirometry at low lung volumes later still decreased flow occurs at larger lung volumes cf usually produces an obstructive pattern on spirometry but a restrictive pattern can indicate substantial gas trapping in general a 10 decrease in fev 1 is considered a sign of worsening lung function and possibly a sign of a respiratory infection 78 patients with an fev 1 of less than 30 of predicted are at higher risks for nocturnal hypoxia and hypercapnia and should be evaluated for nocturnal desaturation oxygen saturation should be monitored routinely to assess the need for supplemental oxygen in patients with moderate to severe disease structural changes can also be noted using radiographic studies annual chest radiographs are recommended for unstable cf patients and may be useful in documenting the progression of disease or response to treatment in patients with stable clinical states chest radiographs should be performed every 2 to 4 years instead of annually if bronchiectasis is suspected highresolution computed tomography is indicated see fig 1  78inhaled bronchodilators inhaled bronchodilators specifically β agonists can be administered by nebulizer metereddose inhaler or oral inhaler in cf patients with a documented drop in fev1 by 12 or 200 m l indicating bronchodilator response in the effort to treat airway hyperreactivity 79 few studies show significant improvement in clinical pulmonary function with routine use of bronchodilator therapy longterm use of β agonists should be approached with caution because animal studies have shown submucosal gland hypertrophy and a possible hypersecretory state with prolonged use although no human studies have duplicated this finding 80 salmeterol a longacting β agonist is effective in decreasing nocturnal hypoxia in patients with cf 81 hypertonic saline either a 6 or a 3 solution has been shown to reduce sputum viscoelasticity and to increase cough clearance in cf patients 82dornase alfa recombinant human deoxyribonuclease i pulmozyme in addition to hypertonic saline is believed to improve mucociliary clearance by hydrolyzing extracellular dna which is present at high levels in cf patients improved lung function has been noted with the use of this drug in a multicenter placebocontrolled study patients treated with dornase alfa had a 124 improvement in fev 1 above baseline and a 21 increase compared with those receiving placebo  p  001 8384 side effects of dornase alfa include hoarseness changes in phonation and mild pharyngitis 5 a mucolytic agent such as n acetylcysteine nac can be used for airway clearance although few data exist to support the use of nac 85 given its unpleasant side effects including noxious odor and potential for bronchospasm nac has a limited role in cf airway clearance airway clearance techniques should be routinely performed on a daily basis by all cf patients 86 before eating and usually bronchodilators are used during or before airway clearance treatment inhaled corticosteroids and antibiotics should usually be reserved until the airway clearance technique is completed so that airways have fewer secretions allowing greater penetration of medications in selecting a particular treatment the patients age preference and lifestyle should be taken into account because no one technique is superior chest physiotherapy consisting of chest percussion and postural drainage chest clapping is the primary method of secretion clearance the patient is usually positioned so that gravity assists in draining mucus from areas of the lung while avoiding the headdown position using cupped hands or a clapping device the chest wall is vibrated or percussed to clear mucus the therapy can be used on patients of all ages and can be concentrated in certain areas of the lungs that need more attention usually an additional caregiver is needed to provide this treatment but patients who are independent may be able to perform their own percussion on the front and sides of the chest 87 assisting the cough of a cf patient through external application of pressure to the epigastric or thoracic cage can assist in the clearance 87a forced exhalation or huff during mid or low lung volumes can improve mucus clearance a technique called forced expiration consists of two huffs followed by relaxed breathing unlike postural drainage the active cycle of breathing treatment improves lung function without decreasing oxygenation and does not need an assistant 88 this airway clearance technique is a combination of breathing control thoracic expansion and the forced expiration technique it improves oxygen delivery to the alveoli and distal airways and promotes clearance of mucus to the proximal airways to be cleared by huffing 89autogenic drainage is a method of breathing performed at three different lung volumes to augment airflow in the different divisions of the airways air needs to be moved in rapidly to unstick mucus and avoid airway collapse no desaturations occur during this technique but it does require concentration and might not be appropriate for young cf patients 88the application of positive expiratory pressure pep by mechanical ventilation or by intermittent positive pressure breathing devices can assist in airway collapse in cf bronchiectasis resulting in wall weakness can lead to collapse and retained secretions lowpressure pep highpressure pep and oscillation pep are three methods to help reduce airway collapse all using a device that provides expiratory lengthening and manometric measurements at the mouth 87 oscillating pep can enhance clearance of secretions in a way that is relatively easy for the patient it is low cost and it is easily movable 90highfrequency chest wall compression is performed using a compression vest that allows therapy to large chestwall areas simultaneously no assistance is needed with this therapy and it may be ideal for the independent cf patient 91intrapulmonary percussive ventilation provides frequent small lowpressure breaths to the airways in an oscillatory manner this method is limited by its high cost and lack of portability but unlike some other devices it can be used to deliver medications 78the effect of exercise in cf is not clear whether it enhances mucus clearance is debatable but quality of life improves and there is a lower mortality rate among cf patients who exercise regularly 78 regular exercise enhances cardiovascular fitness improves functional capacity and improves quality of life therefore exercise should be advocated strongly in the adult cf patient 5some of the contraindications to airway therapy include poorly controlled reflux disease massive hemoptysis and the presence of an untreated pneumothorax antibiotics improved antibiotics against bacterial infections especially p aeruginosa have resulted in an increased life span for the cf patient the aim of cf therapy should be prevention of bacterial lung infections environmental hygiene measures including cohorting patients according to infection status can limit crossreaction 92 the most important bacterial organisms in cf are s aureus p aeruginosa and b cepacia but others have also emerged including s maltophilia achromobacter xylosoxidans and nontuberculous bacteria 93 intravenous antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy for acute exacerbations the choice of antibiotic is difficult in cf because of resistance patterns therefore the choice should be based on the most recent sensitivities of the surveillance sputum cultures if a recent culture is not available antibiotic coverage should include treatment for both staphylococcus and pseudomonas species most centers typically choose a thirdgeneration cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside given for 2 to 3 weeks intravenously at higher doses because of the volume of distribution in cf patients inhaled antibiotic aerosols can effectively minimize toxicity and allow certain aminoglycosides to be administered at ome limiting factors include cost taste and distribution in severe disease and acute exacerbations 9 many cf centers have adopted the copenhagen protocol in dealing with infection when with the first isolation of pseudomonas species oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistin are started with intravenous antibiotics given every 4 months to prevent reinfection cohorting and environmental and nutritional issues are monitored as well leading to a significant reduction of chronic infection with pseudomonas species and better pulmonary function 76several large randomized studies have demonstrated a benefit of macrolides in cf patients the results of these investigations seem to indicate that the immunomodulatory effect of these medications and not the antibacterial effect is responsible for the outcomes of the medication experts have suggested using macrolides for 6 months azithromycin or clarithromycin in cf children or in adults not improving on conventional therapy 94 azithromycin has been shown to be highly effective in improving pulmonary function over a 6month period in cf patients homozygous for δf508 and not receiving dornase alfa 95other treatments in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or asthma oral corticosteroids can be used although alternateday steroids have been used in the past for cf exacerbations to reduce airway inflammation experts agree that this method should be used more cautiously ibuprofen has been used as an antiinflammatory agent and in one trial lung function declined more slowly in ibuprofen users 96 other therapies currently undergoing trials include surfactant to reduce sputum adhesiveness gelsolin to sever factin bonds in sputum thus reducing the tenacity of sputum and thymosin b 4 to improve sputum transport 76lung transplantation in advanced lung disease resulting from cf the options for treatment are limited lung transplantation is the only effective therapeutic option not only to prolong survival 1 year survival 80 5year survival 60 97 but also to improve quality of life the international lung transplant committee issued guidelines in 1998 for the selection of lung transplantation candidates 98 based on these criteria cf patients should be referred for transplantation when the fev 1 is less than 30 of predicted if hypoxia or hypercapnia is present if hospitalizations increase in frequency or if hemoptysis or cachexia is an issue  box 2  early in the history of lung transplantation cf patients colonized with b cepacia were not candidates for transplantation but recent advances in careful specific taxonomic testing of b cepacia have allowed this patient population

interventions for nutritional support should be instituted to prevent further weight loss 101pleural adhesion and previous pleurodesis are not contraindications to transplantation if pleurodesis is indicated we recommend that it be performed in conjunction with a transplantation center to minimize any complications that can occur at the time of transplantation unstable cf patients requiring mechanical ventilation are not candidates for lung transplantation at any transplant center meyers and colleagues reported 1year outcomes in stable mechanically ventilated patients who underwent transplantation 102 currently only a limited number of centers perform lung transplantation in ventilatordependent patients recent attention has focused on living lobar transplantation which involves the removal of a lower lobe from each of two donors and subsequent transplant into a child or small adult 103 shortterm outcomes have been comparable with those using cadaveric transplants this procedure involves three patients and thus a possible increase in the potential morbidity and mortality although no donor deaths have been reported 104for more information on identifying which patients are more likely to benefit from receiving a lung transplant contact the cleveland clinic foundation lung transplant center or the cystic fibrosis foundations website more than 1400 people have received lung transplants since 1988 6nutritional care and supplementation cf patients should eat a wellbalanced diet a standard north american diet with 3540 fat calories without fat restriction always given with entericcoated pancreatic enzymes anthropomorphic measurements should be made every 3 to 4 months and cf patients should be educated regarding their ideal body weight range annual

iuday vitamin d 400800 iuday with adequate sunlight exposure and vitamin k 25 to 50 mgweek if the body mass index decreases enteral feeding should be considered through gastrostomy tubes or

addition of pancreatic enzymes h 2 blockers and agents to thin bowel contents including the radiographic contrast solution diatrizoate may be used complete obstructions should be treated with enemas oral mineral oil and oral polyethylene glycol3350 solutions 9back to top prognosis overall the life expectancy in cf has risen since the 1980s recent figures show the median age of survival increased by 14 years in 2000 compared with figures from 1980 the predicted mean survival age was 316 years in 2000 6 in 1990 30 of patients in the cf registry were older than 18 years this has continued to rise 402 of patients in 2002 were older than 18 years although overall survival rates have improved female patients have had consistently poorer survival rates than male cf patients in the age range from 2 to 20 years it is not clear why this is the case 105lung function predictions over time are difficult to estimate but cf patients often have extended periods of stabilized lung function that can last for 5 years or more most patients have fulltime or parttime jobs and many are married and have children in the patient registry 6 more than 185 women who had cf were pregnant in 2002 8many patients have normal life spans and endoflife options need to be addressed with patients and their families advancecare planning should be done early in the disease course the goal of advancecare planning is to respect the patients wishes 5back to top summary cf is the most common autosomal recessive lifelimiting disease among the white population with current management almost 80 of patients with cf will reach adulthood the delivery of health care to the adult cf patient has thus become relevant to the nonpediatric physician cf is caused by a defective gene that causes the body to produce an abnormally thick sticky mucus that leads to airway obstruction subsequent lifethreatening lung infections and endstage lung disease cf is an autosomal recessive trait the most common mutation in the cftr gene is caused by the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 δf508 newborn screening for cf has been instituted in eight states although national screening plans have not been mandated the most profound changes from cf occur in the lungs and airways where chronic infections involve a limited number of organisms including p aeruginosa which is implicated most often followed by s aureus h influenzae and s maltophilia gastrointestinal symptoms in cf occur early and continue throughout the life of a cf patient problems include intestinal obstruction and various aspects of pancreatic insufficiency female patients with cf are not as infertile as their male counterparts and birth control must be discussed with female patients reaching sexual maturity the cystic fibrosis foundation
