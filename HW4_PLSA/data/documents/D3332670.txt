how do you know when a wart is gone updated on february 08 2013m c asks from carpentersville il on february 11 20087 answers my son was diagnosed with a wart on the side of his foot right before christmas and had it frozen off very painfully at the doctors office the doc instructed us to follow up a few days later by soaking it scraping off the dead skin with a callous remover and then applying compoundw strips or otc liquid salicylic acid and duct tape every 12 days until its gone the strips didnt seem to work very well we went through a whole box of them so now weve switched over to the liquid wart remover the one that stinks really bad when you paint it on the wart anyway the liquid stuff duo film creates a film layer as it dries on the skin so then when we scrape it off every night were not sure if were scraping dead skin the wart or the dried medicine from the night before doing this stuff everyday has become a royal pia thankfully my son is very patient with ithe wasnt in the beginning anyway how do we know when the wart is truly gone so we can stop this part of our nightly routine it was never dark or discolored at the beginning or through this whole removal process it has always looked white like a blister even from the beginning now its just more flush with his foot in terms of size edit thanks for the advice so far about keeping surfaces and clothes clean to prevent spreading it and the tips on how to care for it i know what were doing is working because it has definitely shrunk and may even be gone but thats my question how do i know when its gone respond to question what can i do next add your own comment ask your own question join the mamapedia community report as inappropriate share this with your friends write m c a private message

huge issue with warts and they do come back a lot of the time they are viral and a pia as you mentioned maybe do it every other day for a little while longer after you stop watch for signs of it returning and if it doesnt great and if it does start the process over also watch becasue they can spread so make sure you and your son always wash your hand thoroughly when your done with the procedure last thing you want is warts on the handsnail bed those are super hard to get rid of here is an article i foundhttpwwwcnncomhealthlibraryds00370html good luck 1 mom found this helpful helpful yes  no share report l manswers from chicago on february 12 2008warts are caused by a virus that lives in your system once you have it so more can come back i have heard of remedies treating it rather than the chemicals i had one frozen off by the skin doc and then my finger got so infected it had to be lanced and took forever to heal it was very painful something in the peel of a banana makes them go away so does putting about a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in a little bit of water and gulping that down quickly it was strange mine went away almost completely after dabbing a bit of apple cider vinegar the kind wthe mother in itbrand name braggs not the filtered heinz kind on it and covering wa band aid for a while then it went completely away this fall after a itchy skin rash i had that was systemic very strange buggers they arehelpful yes  no share report c danswers from springfield on february 11 2008i hate to say it but i had a lot of experience with warts during my pregnancy it went from 1 during the first trimester to about 10 on one foot and 3 on the other which all disappeared after i delivered my daughter be very diligent about washing socks keeping the wart off of family surfaces floors and washing hands they spread quickly ask for a refferal to a podiatrist they will give you a prescription treatment to apply to the wart also keep scraping the dead skin off because a callous will form over the wart helpful yes  no share report kanswers from chicago on february 12 2008warts are so stubborn i used the finger nail clippers to clip off the dead skin when i was getting rid of my last one a few years ago once you start bleeding you know youve gotten below the wart esp in feet you usually have to dig a bit i found that using those otc freeze things worked pretty well but you had to be aggressive with it we did freezethaw cycles freeze 30 sec thaw 30 sec repeat 3x and then a few days later scrape off the dead skin repeat until the wart is really gone ie bleeds when you scrape and hurts like normal skin if you try and freeze maybe this is more than you can expect from a 5year old though just keep at ithelpful yes  no share report d panswers from chicago on february 14 2008my advice would be to wait a few days and take a look at it be careful because any scraping can actually cause the wart to spread it is a virus some people have problems with warts like me and some people like my husband will get them and they will go away on their own the only way to tell if its really gone is if there is no raised portion or especially any tiny black spot and the skin all looks like the surrounding skin freezing will cause an added blister and that takes a little while to heal back to normal too you have to stop using the acid for a few days to really be able to tell also if it hasnt gone away i would recommend seeing a podiatrist and not just a regular pediatrician freezing has never worked for me and overthecounter stuff for sure has never worked for me good luckhelpful yes  no share report f panswers from chicago on february 25 2008my 5 yr old hadhas a wart on his hand he hadhas the thing for like 6 months like you i tried all that over the counter stuff none of it worked and he refused to let me file it so i made an appointment with a dermatologist and of course 2 days after i made the appt it fell off my appt wasnt for 2 wks so i kept it and figured i would have her look at it to make sure its healing like it should well to my surprise she told me it wasnt completely gone so she gave me a prescription for it and told me to put it on and do the filing also well he refuses to let me put it on or file and it hasnt change actually i havent looked at it recently but if it was growing he would tell me anyway i would make an appt with a dermatogilst just to have them look at it and they can tell you exactly what to do if anything most likely its still there from the way you described it so they will probably give you a prescrpit something stronger that will work quicker and better since your child is so coperative i would definately follow through and you will probably have a follow up visit to make sure its gone if they dont tell you to i would make one anyway i hope this helps helpful yes  no share report p panswers from los angeles on february 08 2013i have been struggling with a common wart on my index finger for about a year now and just like you ive tried every otc remedy with no success i also had it frozen down at the doctors and it seemed to work pretty good until it appeared again i didnt want to freeze again so painful so i opted for an herbal remedy  tea tree oil or melaleuca oil the process is very simple natural painless might sting a little but thats when you know its fighting it and smells good  you just need to get 100 pure essential tea tree oil  they sell it at cvs in the natural products section make sure to buy the one that contains only melaleuca in it you might find cheaper oils with a ton of different ingredients you dont want in it just apply one drop of pure oil over the cleaned wart and cover with a band aid repeat this every 8 hour or twice daily ive started this procedure on this past monday and have seen considerable change after 2 days doing this the wart has now lost volume and is blackening already with no pain whatsoevermelaleuca or tea tree oil is naturally antibacterial antiviral and antifungal and is used for a lot of different purposes i got the treatment procedure from this website httpwwwlivestrongcomarticle78752applyteatreeoi
