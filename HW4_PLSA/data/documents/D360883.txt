the scratch wiki will be transferred to its new domain httpsenscratchwikiinfo on the 16 th of february 2018 at 1400 utc point all links to the new domain now and be warned that this current domain will be frozen starting from 1300 and will never be unfrozen program redirects here for an explanation of the process of writing programs with code see programming an example script a script is a collection or stack of blocks that all interlock with one another the blocks and their order are very important as they determine how sprites interact with each other and the backdrop sometimes comments are attached to scripts to explain what certain blocks do and what the scripts purpose is contents  hide 1 use2 structure3 definition4 script errors5 script fragments6 see also use scripts are easy to work with some rules are as follows to create a script one simply has to drag blocks out of the block palette and assemble them to assemble blocks they must be dragged on below or in another block except for hat blocks  to disassemble blocks they must be dragged apart to remove a script drag it into any of the block palettes or rightclick the hat block and press delete to start a single script just click on it scripts can be edited in the scripts tab of every sprite and the stage  structure every block shape is designed so that it can do one or more of the following start a script add to the end of a script end a script fit inside other blocks contain other blocks because of that blocks can be assembled to create a script like a jigsaw puzzle this prevents syntax errors definition a script is defined within the scratch program as one or a set of blocks that begins with a hat block even a single block can qualify however scripts are usually referred to as sets of blocks that consist of at least two blocks script errors this article or section documents a feature not included in the current version of scratch  20  it is only useful from a historical perspective on error the script turns red when using previous versions when putting certain blocks together it is sometimes possible to make an impossible script impossible meaning that it cannot function see the below example when impossible scripts are run in development mode the script is outlined in red the troublecausing block colored red and the whole script is paused online the player simply ignores it and moves on if possible in the current 20 if you have an error like the one shown the script will just stop errors are usually caused mathematically such as when a script tries to divide by zero or find the square root of negative one trigonometric errors are also common other common errors are caused by using a block only available in sprites in the stage or when an nonexistent item of a list is being accessed for a tutorial on fixing scripts like this see the article debugging scripts  script fragments a script fragment is a script that is incomplete because it is missing a hat block a script fragment will not run during normal execution of a project because nothing triggers the code it is possible to run a script fragment by being in the project editor and clicking on it they are commonly used to create thumbnails because of the ability to show a sprite that isnt visible while normally running the project script fragments can be stored in the backpack and can easily be popped onto a hat to run the code each block in the editor is a script fragment script fragments can be used to integrate a game into an os by pulling scripts off of when green flag clicked and placing them under an when i receive  block usually with the help of the backpack see also blocks how to organize your scripts
