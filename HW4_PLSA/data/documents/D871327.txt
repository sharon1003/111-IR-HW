couple of days would also seem about the norm for minor things like cycling horse riding too a dre is a bit more of an interference so a couple more days the big thing to avoid is the doc giving you the dre first and then drawing the blood it takes about 6 weeks for psa to settle down after a biopsy and bhp and other infections are a bigger influence still and may take months to stop affecting

including recumbants no dre beforehand if you do this every time regardless of whether you have a prostate then you have created a set of conditions that is repeatable and will give you the same condition each time you are tested altering things only gives you altered results james c age 63 gonna make myself a better man tinyurlcom28e8qcg 407 psa 76 707 biopsy 3 of 16 pca 5 involved left lobe
