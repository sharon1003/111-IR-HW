the selection of one alternative course of action from two or more alternative courses of action advertisements precisely it can be stated as a choicemaking activity these steps can be explained as under1 define the problem the first and the foremost step in the decisionmaking process are to define the real problem a problem can be explained as a question for and appropriate solution the manager should consider critical or strategic factors in defining the problem these factors are in fact obstacles in the way of finding proper solution these are also known as limiting factors for example if a machine stops working due to nonavailability of screw screw is the limiting factor in this case similarly fuse is a limiting or critical factor in house lighting while selecting alternative or probable solution to the problem the more the decisionmaking takes into account those factors that are limiting or critical to the alternative solutions the easier it becomes to take the best decision advertisements other examples of critical or limiting factor may be materials money managerial skill technical knowhow employee morale and customer demand political situation and government regulations etc2 analysing the problem after defining the problem the next important step is a systematic analysis of the available data sound decisions are based on proper collection classification and analysis of facts and figures there are three principles relating to the analysis and classification as explained below i the futurity of the decision this means to what length of time the decision will be applicable to a course of action ii the impact of decision on other functions and areas of the business iii the qualitative considerations which come into the picture3 developing alternative solutions after defining and analysing the problem the next step is to develop alternative solutions the main aim of developing alternative solutions is to have the best possible decision out of the available alternative courses of action in developing alternative solutions the manager comes across creative or original solutions to the problems in modern times the techniques of operations research and computer applications are immensely helpful in the development of alternative courses of action4 selecting the best type of alternative after developing various alternatives the manager has to select the best alternative it is not an easy task advertisements the following are the four important points to be kept in mind in selecting the best from variousalternatives a risk element involved in each course of action against the expected gain b economy of effort involved in each alternative ie securing desired results with the least efforts c proper timing of the decision and action d final selection of decision is also affected by the limited resources available at our disposal human resources are always limited we must have right type of people to carry out our decisions their calibre  understanding intelligence and skill will finally determine what they can and cannot do5 implementation of the decision under this step a manager has to put the selected decision into action for proper and effective execution of the decision three things are very important ie a proper and effective communication of decisions to the subordinates decisions should be communicated in clear concise and understandable manner b acceptance of decision by the subordinates is important group participation and involvement of the employees will facilitate the smooth execution of decisions c correct timing in the execution of decision minimizes the resistance to change almost every decision introduces a change and people are hesitant to accept a change implementation of the decision at the proper time plays an important role in the execution of the decision6 follow up a follow up system ensures the achievement of the objectives it is exercised through control simply stated it is concerned with the process of checking the proper implementation of decision follow up is indispensable so as to modify and improve upon the decisions at the earliest opportunity7 monitoring and feedback feedback provides the means of determining the effectiveness of the implemented decision if possible a mechanism should be built which would give periodic reports on the success of the implementation in addition the mechanisms should also serve as an instrument of “preventive maintenance” so that the problems can be prevented before they occur according to peter drucker the monitoring system should be such that the manager can go and look for himself for first hand information which is always better than the written reports or other secondhand sources in many situations however computers are very successfully used in monitoring since the information retrieval process is very quick and accurate and in some instances the selfcorrecting is
