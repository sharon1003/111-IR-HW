minerals closeup a pile of minerals this image shows some of the most common minerals youll find in rocks this pile contains plagioclase feldspar potassium feldspar quartz muscovite mica biotite mica amphibole olivine and calcite can you identify any of them click on any mineral for a close up view quartz quartz is one of the most common minerals in the earths crust it is made up of silicon dioxide si o 2  otherwise known as silica white sand is primarily made from quartz click here to find out more plagioclase feldspar plagioclase is a member of the feldspar mineral family plagioclase feldspars are yet another silicate that contains considerable sodium or calcium feldspar crystals are stubby prisms generally white to gray and a glassy luster this variety of plagioclase called albite is rich in sodium potassium feldspar potassium feldspar is another member of the feldspar mineral family like plagioclase feldspar potassium feldspars are silicate minerals that contain a considerable amount of you guessed it potassium feldspar crystals are stubby prisms often pink to white some potassium feldspars such as the one shown to the left have a streaky appearance see closeup called perthitic texture mica micas are another group of silicate minerals composed of varying amounts of potassium magnesium iron as well as aluminum silicon and water biotite all micas form flat booklike crystals that peal apart into individual sheets on cleavage planes crystals cleave into smooth flakes biotite is dark black or brown mica muscovite shown here is lightcolored or clear mica mica is so soft that you can scratch it with a fingernail amphibole the amphiboles are a family of silicate minerals that form prism or needlelike crystals amphibole minerals generally contain iron magnesium calcium and aluminum in varying amounts along with silicon oxygen and water hornblende shown in this image is a common dark green to black variety of amphibole it is a component in many igneous and metamorphic rocks olivine olivine is another silicate mineral containing iron and magnesium it is a green glassy mineral that forms at high temperature it is common in basalt and in ultramafic rocks gemquality olivine is called peridote a rock made up entirely of olivine is called dunite calcite calcite is made of calcium carbonate ca co 3  generally white to clear it is easily scratched with knife most seashells are made of calcite or related minerals this is the lime of limestone rocks and minerals site contents
