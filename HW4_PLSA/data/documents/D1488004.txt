with high water potential to an area with low water potential49153757 solute potential this measurement has a maximum value of 0 it decreases as the concentration of a solute increases49153758 pressure potential this measurement has a minimum value of 0 when the solution is open to the environment it increases as pressure increases49153759 selective permeability a property of a plasma membrane that allows some substances to cross more easily than others49153760 amphipathic molecules are said to be this when it has regions that are both hydrophilic and hydrophobic49153761 fluid mosaic model the currently accepted arrangement of membranes it is a fluid structure with a mosaic of various proteins embedded in or attached to a double layer of phospholipids proposed by singer and nicolson in 197249153762 integral proteins the proteins of a membrane that penetrate the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer hydrophobic regions consist of nonpolar amino acids while hydrophilic regions are exposed to aqueous solution on either side of membrane49153763 transmembrane proteins the proteins of a membrane that span the entire membrane49153764 peripheral proteins the proteins of a membrane that are not embedded in the lipid bilayer they are appendages loosely bound to the surface of the membrane often exposed to parts of the integral proteins attached by cytoskeleton on cytoplasmic side and by fibers of ecm on extracellular side49153765 transport the function of membrane proteins that allows travel through a hydrophilic channel or by transport proteins which shuttle molecules across the membrane by changing shape with the help of hydrolyzing atp49153766 enzymatic activity the function of membrane proteins that uses the exposure of proteins active sites to adjacent solutions metabolic processes progress to help substances pass49153767 signal transduction the function of membrane proteins that allow proteins to have binding sites with specific shapes that fit chemical messengers external messengers may cause a shape change in protein that relays a message to the inside of the cell usually by binding to a cytoplasmic protein49153768 cellcell recognition the function of membrane proteins in which some glycoproteins serve as id tags that are recognized by membrane proteins of other cells49153769 intercellular joining the function of membrane proteins in which membrane proteins of adjacent cells hook together as in gap junctions or tight junctions49153770 attachment to cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix the function of membrane proteins in which microfilaments bond noncovalently to membrane proteins maintaining cell shape and protein location proteins bound to extracellular matrix molecules can coordinate extracellular and intracellular changes49153771 glycolipids membrane carbohydrates that are covalently bonded to lipids49153772 glycoproteins membrane carbohydrates that are covalently bonded to proteins49153773 first step what step is this in moving a molecule from one side of the membrane to another synthesis of membrane lipids and proteins in er carbohydrates are added to proteins making them glycoproteins the carbohydrate portion can be modified49153774 second step what step is this in moving a molecule from one side of the membrane to anotherinside golgi glycoproteins undergo further carbohydrate modification and lipids acquire carbohydrates becoming glycolipids49153775 third step what step is this in moving a molecule from one side of the membrane to another transmembrane proteins membrane glycolipids and secretory proteins are transported in vesicles to the plasma membrane49153776 fourth step what step is this in moving a molecule from one side of the membrane to another in plasma membrane vesicles are fused releasing secretory proteins from the cell vesicle fusion positions carbohydrates on the outside of the plasma membrane asymmetrical arrangement in the plasma membrane is determined by construction in the er and golgi49153777 transport protein a membrane protein that is responsible for moving hydrophilic substances from one side to the other49153778 channel protein a membrane protein specifically a transport protein that has a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel49153779 aquaporin a membrane protein specifically a transport protein that facilitates the passage of water through channel proteins49153780 carrier protein a membrane protein specifically a transport protein that holds onto molecules and changes their shapes in a way that shuttles them across the membrane50658221 concentration gradient the region along which the density of a substance decreases50658222 up when a substance diffuses from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration it is moving  its concentration gradient50658223 down when a substance diffuses from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration it is moving  its concentration gradient50658224 tonicity the ability of a solution to cause a cell to gain or lose water depends partly on concentration of nonpenetrating solutes relative to inside of cell50658225 osmoregulation the control of water balance50658226 turgid a cell with a cell wall that has a reasonable amount of pressure but is healthy50658227 flaccid a cell with a cell wall that is in an isotonic solution that allows for a steady volume50658228 facilitated diffusion passive diffusion that is aided by transport proteins but that does not require cellular energy50658229 membrane potential the voltage of a plasma membrane ranges from 50 m v to 200 m v the  signifies in which direction the substances move   outside of cell50658230 membrane potential favors the passive transport of cations into the cell and anions out of the cell50658231 electrochemical gradient the combination of forces that acts on membrane potential50658232 nonpolar when  entities hit the membrane they dissolve through it and pass through the membrane and into the cell50658233 ionic when  entities hit the membrane they accompany a protein in order to be dissolved regardless of size50658234 small nonpolar when  entities hit the membrane they pass through the membrane alone50658235 large polar when  entities hit the membrane they are completely blocked from entering50658236 gated channel a highly selective tunnel on a plasma membrane that can open or close depending on conformational changes they are changed due to electrical disturbances bonding of a specific ligand

works largely with h ions in plants fungi and bacteria50658239 cotransport a mechanism through which a single atppowered pump that transports a specific solute can indirectly drive the active transport of several other solutes substances that have been pumped across membrane can do work as they move back across the membrane by diffusion50658240 exocytosis occurs when a cell secretes

side by fuzzy layer of coat proteins when ligands bond to receptors coated pits form a vesicle that contains ligand molecules50658245 ligand any molecule that bonds specifically to a receptor site of
