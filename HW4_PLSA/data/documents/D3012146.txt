some 55 years ago 1961  perished a few miles away in a crash it used to be maintained by the cotton city airmens association my father was a member”the earliest depiction which has been located of the cotton city landing area was on the 1964 usgs topo map it depicted 2 unpaved runways in an x shape there were no buildings depicted on the site the 1980 usgs topo map depicted a completely different runway orientation at cotton city compared to 1964with 2 perpendicular unpaved runways oriented northsouth  eastwest the cotton city landing area was not depicted on the 199091 nm aeronautical chart courtesy of alex hauzer a 1998 usgs aerial view looking north depicted cotton city as having 2 perpendicular unpaved runways oriented northsouth  eastwest sam taylor reported in 2016 “a few years ago crop dusters used it for refuelingbut according to my relatives no one else has used it in years i have a brother who lives on the edge of the strip another brother owns an adjoining section on the strip where the canopy hangar still stands  is used for farm equipment storage”in 2013 my brothers dragged both runways in anticipation of my landing there but it is now overgrown again i plan a flight every year to the strip in memory of my father but something always comes up”a 2014 aerial view looking north depicted the cotton city runways as remaining recognizable but deteriorated the site of cotton city landing area is located south of the intersection of route 338  county road 81 thanks to sam taylor for pointing out this airfieldturner ridgeport airport nm72 silver city nm3275

ridgeport airport was established on 9171 the earliest depiction which has been located of turner ridgeport airport was on the 198485 nm aeronautical chart courtesy of alex hauzer it depicted turner ridgeport as having a 4000 paved runway 1533  a 2400 gravel runway 826 as of 1985 turner rudgeport was a private airfield owned by grant city flying service and managed by william turner it had 2 runways a 4000 asphalt runway 1533  a 2400 soil runway 826 the airport was said to have 2 based aircraft 1 multiengine aircraft  1 ultralight aircraft the last aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of turner ridgeport airportwas on the 199091 nm aeronautical chart courtesy of alex hauzer it depicted turner ridgeport as a private airfield having a single northsouth 4000 paved runway the 1992 usgs topo map depicted turner ridgeport airport as having a single paved northwestsoutheast runway with 3 small buildings on the northeast side the earliest photo which has been located of turner ridgeport airport was a 10797 usgs aerial view looking southeast it depicted turner ridgeports single paved runway on the right with a ramp with a few small buildings on the north side in the foreground there were no aircraft visible or any other sign of recent aviation usage however the photo also appeared to depict 2 other unpaved runways on the east side left of the airportwere these runways that predated the paved runway a 72511 aerial view looking southeast at turner ridgeport airport showed it to remain intact although evidently abandoned the remains of the other possible runways to the east also remained recognizable the date of closure of turner ridgeport airport has not been determined it was depicted as an abandoned airfield on the 2012 sectional chart it was presumably closed due to competition from the whiskey creek airport located only 5 miles to the east the site of turner ridgeport airport is located southwest of the intersection of route 90  truck bypass roadrodeo intermediate field  rodeo airport rodeo nm3193 10899 northwest of el paso txrodeo airport as depicted on the september 1942 douglas sectional chart courtesy of chris kennedy the rodeo intermediate field was evidently established as one of the department of commerces network of intermediate fieldswhich were constructed in the 1920s  1930s to serve as emergency landing fieldsalong commercial airways between major cities the date of construction of the rodeo intermediate field has not been determined the earliest reference to the field which has been locatedwas its listing in the 1934 department of commerce airway bulletin according to david brooks it described rodeo intermediate field as the department of commerces site 57a it described the field as having 2 dirt 3950 eastwest  3140 northsouth the 1136 department of commerce airway bulletin courtesy of bruce thompsondescribed rodeo intermediate field as the department of commerces site 57aalong the san diego – el paso airway it described the field as an irregularlyshaped sod fieldcontaining 2 runways 3950 eastwest  3140 northsouth the field was said to have a rotating beacon and boundary  approach lights a shed was said to be marked with “57a sdel p”bruce observed “it is interesting to note that the coordinates listed in the facility directoryare incorrect  place the field in the mountains to the west”the earliest aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of the rodeo airportwas on the september 1942 douglas sectional chart courtesy of chris kennedy it depicted rodeo as site 26a it also depicted the adjacent rodeo radio beaconbut indicated “radio range inoperative until further notice”the only photo which has been located showing rodeo intermediate field while in operationwas a circa 194245 aerial view looking north from the 1945 aaf airfield directory courtesy of scott murdock it depicted rodeo intermediate field as an unpaved irregularlyshaped landing area the 1945 aaf airfield directory courtesy of scott murdock described rodeo intermediate fieldas a 140 acre lshaped property field having 2 bare runways measuring 3950 eastwest  3140 northsouth the field was not said to have any hangarsbut was said to be illuminated with a rotating beacon course lights obstacle lights boundary lights and range lights the airfield was described as being owned by the u s government  the state of nm and operated by the civil aeronautics administration an undated photo of a piper cub in front of the rodeo radio tower  shack from a june 1947 skyways magazine article courtesy of jerry sorrell jerry reported “according to the article the cub in the photo is new and is on a ferry trip from the piper factory in lock haven pa to e monte ca”the january 1949 douglas sectional chart courtesy of chris kennedy depicted “rodeo caa” as site 26ahaving a 4000 unpaved runway it also depicted the adjacent rodeo radio beacon the last aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of the rodeo airportwas on the 1953 douglas sectional chart according to david brooks it depicted rodeo as site 26b with 2 unpaved runways the longest being 3950 the rodeo airport was evidently abandoned at some point between 195354as it was no longer depicted on the september 1954 douglas sectional chart according to chris kennedy intermediate fields had largely become superfluous with advances in the range  reliability of commercial aircraft the last map depiction which has been located of the rodeo intermediate field was on the 1955 usgs topo map it labeled the airfield as “rodeo caa” nothing was depicted at the site of rodeo intermediate field on the 1982 usgs topo map a 2006 aerial view still showed the recognizable outline of the 2 runways at the site of rodeo intermediate field a february 2007 aerial view by bruce thompson looking east at the arrow  building remains at the site of rodeo intermediate field a february 2007 photo by bruce thompson of rodeos former airmail route directional arrow steve owen noted “the hill in the middledistance that the arrow points directly to is the site of airway beacon 26b”a february 2007 photo by bruce thompson of the water tank foundation at rodeo according to bruce thompson “broken airfield lighting fixtures can be found in a dump across the road from the airfield”a 2010 photo by bruce thompson “of the old radio building from rodeo intermediate field apparently the building was moved into town after the airfield was shut down it is now part of rodeo cottages the airway designation is still visible on the roof on the backside of the building  it says rodeo on the front the backside reads sdep 26a”veronica straus reported in 2011 “i own the rodeo cottages the large cottage was the radio shack when i remodeled it i didnt want to change anything historic so i contacted a wonderful local historian junior gomezand asked him to come  look at it before i put in a new floor  redid the kitchen he told me that he had stayed there as a young boy scout during a rain storm they were camped on the airfield  the radio operator took pity on them  let them sleep inside the radio shack a hutch is built into the wall in the kitchen  i didnt remove it junior says that the bedrooms had twin beds for the pilots  the hutch was always filled with coffee peanut butter  bread when i ripped up the carpet there was a linoleum floorand in the middle of the room there was a 5x7 square of brown linoleum with a lot of holes drilled through the floor junior said that that was where the massive radio was located no pcs then the small cottage was the supply depot it had a bathroom  a wood stove in it”the site of rodeo intermediate field is located northeast of the intersection of route 9  route 80columbus aerodrome  columbus airport columbus nm3182 10763 west of el paso txcolumbus intermediate field as depicted on a 11642 aerial view looking northfrom the 1945 aaf airfield directory courtesy of scott murdock according to the first aero squadron foundation “on 391916 the united states was invaded by forces under the command of the mexican revolutionary pancho villa villa  his troops attacked both civilians  the military outpost in the small border town of columbus nmeighteen americans were killed before the villa rebels were turned back in response president woodrow wilson ordered the american military the socalled punitive expeditionto cross into mexico to locate  destroy villa  his fighting forces accompanying the us ground forces which grew to almost 10000 men was a small detachment of us army airplanes which were based at a landing field outside of columbus this deployment of the first aero squadron flying curtiss jenny biplanes was the first use of us army airplanes in a u s military campaign their columbusbased operation was in effect the birth of what later became the united states air force”the site of the columbus aerodrome was eventually reused as the location of columbus airportwhich was established as one of the department of commerces network of intermediate fieldsin the 1920s  1930s to serve as emergency landing fields along commercial airways between major cities the date of construction of columbus airport has not been determined the earliest reference to the field which has been locatedwas in the 1931 descriptions of airports  landing fields according to david brooks the airport directory companys 1933 airports directory courtesy of chris kennedydescribed columbus airport as a department of commerce intermediate fieldsite 65 along the san diego  el paso airway it was said to have 2 sod runways 3610 eastwest  2628 northsouth the field was said to have a rotating beacon but to offer no services the earliest depiction which has been located of columbus intermediate fieldwas a 11642 aerial view looking north from the 1945 aaf airfield directory courtesy of scott murdock it depicted columbus intermediate field as an unpaved irregularlyshaped landing area the earliest aeronautical chart depiction of the columbus airport which has been locatedwas on the january 1944 el paso sectional chart courtesy of chris kennedy the fields designation had apparently changed at some point between 193344as the 1944 sectional labeled it as site 34 the 1945 aaf airfield directory courtesy of scott murdock described columbus intermediate fieldas a 114 acre triangular property field having a bare allway landing area measuring 3610 eastwest  2610 northsouth the field was not said to have any hangarsbut was said to be illuminated with a rotating beacon course obstacle boundary landing strip and range lights the airfield was described as being owned by private interests and operated by the civil aeronautics administration cy martin recalled “my family traveled that area with my dad when he was assistant airways engineer back during wwii the terminal building at columbus was a communication  weather station the metal building contained 2 diesel powered generators there was no commercial power available in the town although all the buildings were wired for electricity apparently the mom  pop company went bellyup during the depression after the war the area got rea juice”the 1960 jeppesen airway manual courtesy of chris kennedydepicted columbus airport as having a 4210 runway 826  a 2160 runway 1735 a few small buildings were depicted on the northwest side of the field the august 1964 el paso sectional chart courtesy of chris kennedydepicted the columbus faa airport as having a 4200 unpaved runway the 1965 usgs topo map depicted the outline of the airport simply labeled as a landing area a surveying marker named colair was depicted at the location of the former airport beacon in 1965 it was transitioned over to the city of columbus  it became columbus municipal airport according to david brooks the 1967 flight guide courtesy of chris kennedydepicted columbus airport as having a 4210 runway 826  a 2160 runway 1735 the status of the columbus airport evidently changed at some point between 196776 to that of a private fieldas that is how it was depicted on the july 1976 cg19 world aeronautical chart courtesy of chris kennedy the 1976 aopa airports usa directory according to chris kennedydescribed columbus municipal as having a single 4210 gravel runway 826 the 1991 usgs topo map still depicted the outline of the former airportnow simply labeled as a landing area a surveying marker named colair was depicted at the location of the former airport beacon the last chart depiction which has been located of columbus as an active airfieldwas on the 1994 cg19 world aeronautical chart according to david brooks the distinctive outline of the columbus airport was still very much apparent in a 1996 usgs aerial view looking north it does not appear as if any buildings or the beacon tower remain standing though columbus airport was evidently closed at some point between 199498as it was no longer depicted at all on the 1998 world aeronautical chart vicki engle reported in 2005 “the federal government closed the columbus runwaysbecause they were being used by drug smugglers the tower minus the beacon which has been misplaced or stolenis located at the columbus historical society museum  not yet erected but awaiting funds to do so”a 2005 photo by clifford bossie of a light cone  boundary markers at the site of columbus airport clifford reported “coming in from the east i could see a boundary or perimeter light cone  marker from nm highway 9 there is a northsouth road that runs along the eastern edge of the fieldso i turned onto that  drove down to the ne corner of the field there are still boundary markers  light cones marking the perimeter of the fieldbut the field itself is pretty well overgrown with mesquite sage  other vegetation i seriously doubt that it was active as recently as 1994 the rutted dirt road running inside the northern boundary was in better shape than the runwaysand it has been many years since it has seen a grader”a 2005 photo by clifford bossie of what appears to be the foundation of the former terminal building clifford noted “following that road to the west i came to the location of where the airport buildings had been located there are two foundations there one large one that most likely had been what would have passed for the terminaland the other was most likely where the generator andor utilities were located the airport is located close enough to town that utilities might very well have come from the same sources as the townand the generator might have been for emergency use this last foundation had several pipes sticking up which were most likely conduits for wiring”a 2005 photo by clifford bossie of the former airmail route directional arrow clifford reported “there was also a base for the beacon tower  an arrow that pointed along the airway routeboth being red  the arrow had a survey marker embedded into it i could not find any evidence of hangars  the area around the foundations is choked with weeds  grass”a 2005 photo by clifford bossie of a “fairsized metal building at the museum that looks to be a candidatefor the one that housed the generator  any other ancillary equipment”a 2005 photo by clifford bossie of the former columbus airport tower  beaconwhich was relocated at some point to the nearby columbus historical society museum clifford noted “all of the glass is broken out of the beacon itself”according to the first aero squadron foundation “in 2007 a group of aviation enthusiasts  other interested citizensmet to discuss what might be done to protect the site of the original landing field  flight line where the first aero squadron was based in 191617 while the site is listed on the national register of historic places it was threatened by ever expanding residential  commercial development it was even listed as one of most endangered historic sites in nm by 2008 the group had formed the first aero squadron foundation fasf with the mission of securing preserving  restoring the historic aerodrome in 2009 the fasf purchased 60 acres of the historic site comprising part of the original 1916 aerodrome as well as the old columbus municipal airport itself steeped in history thanks to the dedication of the board  our friends we own this land free  clear in 2012 we graded a 2600 runway on the site of the original columbus municipal airport eastwest runwaywhich had become overgrown with mesquite cacti  other desert plants making the field unusable by aircraft”a june 2013 photo of 1 st aero squadron lt col chi chi rodriguez courtesy of ric lambart looking west along the columbus runway with the windsock in background ric lambart observed “the photo was taken in the year of the 1 st aero squadrons centennial birthday chi chi was the first commanding officer of the first to have revisited the historic field since the unit left columbus for wwi back in february of 1917”according to the first aero squadron foundation “in 2014 we acquired access to  an option to buy the 160 acre parcel to the east of the first 60acre parcelwhich we are now engaged in paying off – and we are already thanks to our buy an acre campaign more than halfway there with both parcels under fasf control the entire original landmarked historic site is now protected we are no longer on anyone’s endangered listwith the historic site secured our next step is to build a commemorative monument to honor all the intrepid early airmen  their crewswho pioneered the beginnings of american air power – and its lead in world civil aviation development we will reconstruct the original 1916 aerodrome  build a museum to house a representative selection of early world war i  preworld war ii aircraft as of 2015 we made the final payment on the new 160 acre part of the old 191617 airfield so its now entirely in the name of the fasf”the distinctive outline of the columbus airport was still very much apparent in a 2016 aerial view looking north the site of columbus airport is located southeast of the intersection of route 9

courtesy of steve owen this remote airfield located along the mexican borderwas built as one of the department of commerces network of intermediate fieldswhich were constructed in the 1930s along airways in between major citiesfor the emergency use of commercial aircraft the date of construction of the mount riley airfield has not been determined the earliest depiction to be possibly located of the mt riley caa airway beaconwas an undated photo believed to be mount riley from a may 1932 kohler generator newsletter courtesy of steve owen the earliest reference to the mt riley intermediate field which has been locatedwas in the 1934 department of commerce airfield directory according to chris kennedywhich described mount riley as site 68 along the san diego  el paso airway it was said to have three sod runways in an l shape with the longest being the 3600 eastwest strip the designation of the field had apparently changed within the next few yearsas the airport directory companys 1938 airfield directory according to chris kennedylisted mount riley as site 37 along the phoenix  el paso airway mount riley caa was still depicted as an active airfield on the 1949 el paso sectional chart courtesy of chris kennedy the airfield was not depicted at all on the 1951 usgs topo map the mount riley intermediate field was apparently closed at some point between 194962as it was not listed in the 1962 aopa airport directory the airfield was not depicted at all on usgs topo maps from 1974 or 1981 however the cleared area of the airfield was depicted although not labeled on the 1985 usgs topo map as seen in the 1996 usgs aerial photothe desert climate  lack of development in the southwestern usgenerally results in a former airfield still remaining in a remarkably intact state of preservationand that is the case with mount riley the outline of the 3 former runways is still completely recognizableas the land within the former airfield remains noticeably more clear of scrub than the surrounding property there are no traces of any former buildings at the site lloyd sumner reported in 2004 i first discovered this airstrip a couple of years agoby looking at an aerial photograph of the area i noticed an unusual pattern in the desert that looked like an airstrip to me i have been in this area many times before  never saw anything resembling an airfield my curiosity got the best of me  i drove out to the site to look around i followed a primitive road heading south from the old town of mount rileya ghost town along the abandoned el paso  southwestern railroad off this road is a side road almost totally overgrown with shrubsand no indication that anyone has traveled that road in many years about 100 yards down the road i came to the northern point of the northsouth runway  parked the truck lloyd continued after walking around for a biti found a concrete foundation painted red with angle iron set in the concrete  cut off at ground level this used to be the base of a beacon tower i also found several pieces of broken concrete also painted red piecing these together they form a huge arrow once used to point out the direction of the air route a few other concrete foundations were in the immediate areaincluding what looked like a foundation to a generator house many tin oilcans part to an old 4cylinder engine  other rubbish were strewn around the surrounding desert lloyd continued i walked around south along the northsouth runwayand noticed that about every 100 yards were a series of short polessimilar to a fence post were set in the ground there were about 10 of these poles set about 20 feet apart another 100 yards down the runway was another series of these poles this continued all the way around the perimeter of the airfield in the surrounding desert around each of these series of poles i found several old light bulbs 25 watt westinghouse at the south end of the northsouth runway i found several empty 55 gallon drums lloyd continued i also found the site of one of the navigation beacons used to mark this airway it is on a hill about 10 miles west of the mount riley airstrip the beacon is on top of a 50foot hill the foundation of the beacon tower is identical to the foundation i found at the mount riley airstrip at the base of the hill is a stone structure with concrete mounting blocksthat apparently used to secure a gasoline motor  generator in the side of the hill are several telephone poles were once used to carry the electrical wires to the tower all sorts of rubble broken light bulbs fuse blocks wires etc can be found at the top of the hill portions of a concrete arrow are near the generator house at the bottom of the hill clifford bossie visited the site of the mt riley airfield in 2005 he reported “from the air the outline is clear but from the ground it is a lot harder to find it appears that when the field was graded the grading did little more than remove the vegetation it is by no means flat but i guess in the days it was built  aircraft reliability was an iffy propositionit would look pretty good to a pilot in distress a landing there might damage the airplane but there was a good probability of survival”a 2005 photo by clifford bossie of the boundary posts at mt riley according to clifford “the posts that mr sumner describes in his text were to hold the field boundary markers it is possible that the light bulbs he mentions in his text were used to light those markers i found no evidence of any field lighting this was a very primitive field i suspect that the boundary markers were removed for scrap during wwiiand also suspect that the field had been long abandoned by then”a 2005 photo by clifford bossie of foundations at the site of the mt riley airfield clifford continued “the foundations on the northeast corner of the field are still very noticeableand in fact that was the first indication that i had managed to reach the right location i would hazard a guess that the two large concrete block held the fuel tank sthe lower portion the generator shackand the red concrete pad still has the cutoff legs for the beacon as mr sumner describes the red concrete is actually a thin layer of red colored or dyed concrete not painted layed on top of the beacon foundation the whole area around this foundation has had an outline of caliche rocks forming a boxkind of like you used to see on army bases around barracks there are a couple of smaller boxes that i can only guess the purpose of the air route navigation arrow is outside of this boxed area”a 2005 photo by clifford bossie of foundations at the site of the mt riley airfield clifford continued “the airfield is about 23 miles away from the mt riley railroad stationand about a mile south of nm highway 9 i do not think the airfield was manned around the clock if at all there does not appear to have been any other structures than the area for the generator  beacon my personal belief is that any caretaker lived at the el paso  south westerns mt riley stationor more likely that the railroad was contracted to maintain it i did not see any evidence of telephone polesso i dont know how a pilot making an emergency landing could contact anyone afterwards radios were not all that common”a 2006 aerial photo by clifford bossie looking southeast at the remains of the former runways at mt riley a 32015 photo by tony rivera of the remains of the red concrete arrow at the site of the mt riley airfield a 32015 photo by tony rivera of the site of the mt riley airfield a 32015

phoenix sectional chart courtesy of chris kennedy it was simply labeled landing strip on the 1982 usgs topo map the 1991 usgs topo map depicted a single eastwest runway labeled simply as landing strip it was not depicted at all even as an abandoned airfield on aeronautical charts from 1998 or 2003 a 2003 photo looking southwest at deming aux 2 by bill suffa i was climbing at about 8000 feet when i took this picture i was climbing out of deming and picking up my ifr clearance as i spotted this field it lies just north of i10 and almost directly under v94 west of the deming vor it looks to have a lot of scrub on it so i doubt it would be suitable for landing today an 112511 aerial view looking southeast shows the deming aux 2 airfield to remain intact though deteriorated the deming aux 2
