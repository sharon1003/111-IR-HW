protoindoeuropean language had a locative case expressing place where an adverbial function the endings are reconstructed as follows singular plural athematic i ø no ending su thematic e y oy oysu in most later indoeuropean languages the locative case merged into other cases often genitive or dative in form andor function but some daughter languages retained it as a distinct case it is found inmodern baltoslavic languages except bulgarian and macedonian although it is mostly  citation needed used with prepositions in the other slavic languagessome classical indoeuropean languages particularly sanskrit and old latinuncommon archaic or literary use in certain modern indian languages such as marathi in which a separate ablative case has however disappearedlatin  editold latin still had a functioning locative singular which descended from the protoindoeuropean form the locative plural was already identical to the dative and ablative plural in classical latin changes to the old latin diphthongs caused the originallydistinctive ending of the locative singular to become indistinguishable from the endings of some other cases declension old latin classical latin merger1st āi ae merged with dativegenitive2nd ei ī merged with genitive3rd ei e ī e originally like the dative but gradually replaced with the ablative because the locative was already identical to the ablative which had a location meaning as well in the plural the loss of distinction between the endings eventually caused the functions of the locative case to be absorbed by the ablative in classical latin the original locative singular ending descended from the old latin form remained in use for a few words for first and second declension it was identical to the genitive singular form in archaic times the locative singular of third declension nouns was still interchangeable between ablative and dative forms but in the augustan period the use of the ablative form became fixed therefore both forms rūrī and rūre may be encountered the latin locative case was only used for the names of cities small islands and a few other isolated words the romans considered all mediterranean islands to be small except for sicily sardinia corsica crete and cyprus britannia was also considered to be a large island there are a few nouns that use the locative instead of a preposition domus becomes domī at home rūs becomes rūrī in the country humus becomes humī on the ground militia becomes militiae in military service in the field and focus becomes focī at the hearth at the center of the community the first declension locative is by far the most common because so many roman place names were first declension such as roma rome and therefore use the same form as the genitive and dative romae at rome and hiberniae in ireland a few placenames were inherently plural even though they are a single city eg athenae athens and cumae cuma these plural names also use the form similar to the dative and ablative athenis at athens and cumis at cumae there are also a number of second declension names that could have locatives eg brundisium brindisi eboracum york with locatives brundisiī at brindisi eboraci at york the locative cannot express being located at multiple locations plural forms only exist because certain proper names such as athenae happen to be plural he is at home can be expressed by  is domi est using the locative but they are at their individual and separate homes cannot be expressed by the locative greek  editin ancient greek the locative merged with the protoindoeuropean dative so that the greek dative represents the protoindoeuropean dative instrumental and locative the dative with the preposition ἐν en in and the dative of time eg τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ or tēî trítēi hēmérāi which means on the third day are examples of locative datives some early texts in particular homer retain the locative in some words for example ἠῶθεν  at dawn iliad 24401 germanic languages  editthe locative case had merged with the dative in early germanic times and was no longer distinct in protogermanic or in any of its descendants the dative does however contrast with the accusative case which is used to indicate motion toward a place it has an allative meaning this difference in meaning between dative and accusative is present in all of the old germanic languages and survives in all germanic languages that retain a distinction between the two cases slavic languages  editamong slavic languages the locative is mostly used after a fixed set of commonly used prepositions besides location slavic languages also employ locative as a way of expressing the method of doing an action time when the action is to take place as well as the topic or theme that something describes in more detail as such it is subordinate to other cases locative is becoming increasingly obsolete in east slavic languages especially russian while it remains in other branches west slavic and south slavic languages the ending depends on whether the word is a noun or an adjective among other factors old slavic  editin old church slavonic the locative is mostly used with preposition some uses of independent locatives remain mostly in expressions of time such as zimě in winter polu nošti at midnight the locative also occurs as the complement of a handful of verbs such as kŭto prikosnǫ sę rizaxŭ moixŭ who touched my garments in old east slavic moreover place names are regularly used in the locative without a preposition czech  editthe czech language uses the locative case to denote location  v české republicein the czech republic  but as in the russian language the locative case may be used after certain prepositions with meanings other than location  o prazeabout prague po

editin the russian language the locative case has largely lost its use as an independent case and became the prepositional case which is used only after a preposition the latter is not always used to indicate location while other cases may also be used to specify location eg the genitive case as in у окна́ by the window statements such as в библиотеке v biblioteke in the library or на аляске na aljaske in alaska demonstrate the use of the prepositional case to indicate location however this case is also used after the preposition о about as in о студенте o studente about the student nevertheless approximately 150 masculine nouns retain a distinct form for the locative case used only after в and на these forms end in у́ or ю́ лежать в снегу́ ležať v snegú to lie in the snow but думать о снеге dumať o snege to think about snow other examples are рай raj paradise в раю́ дым dym smoke and в дыму́ v dymú as indicated by the accent marks the stress is always on the last syllable which is unlike the dative case forms with the same spelling a few feminine nouns that end with the soft sign such as дверь and пыль also have a locative form that differs from the prepositional in that the stress shifts to the final syllable на двери́ na dverí on the door but при две́ри pri dvéri by the door these distinct forms are sometimes referenced as second locative or new locative because they developed independently from the true locative case which existed in the old russian 1 2 3with some words such as дом dom house the second locative form is used only in certain idiomatic expressions while the prepositional is used elsewhere for example на дому́ na domu at the house or at home would be used to describe activity that is performed at home while на до́ме on the house
