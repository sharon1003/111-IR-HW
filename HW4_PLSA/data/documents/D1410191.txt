what is an anglophile technically according to merriamwebster an anglophile is someone who is especially fond of england or of things english personally i think the definition is more complex united kingdom  wikimedia commons the more complex answer to weigh in on the definition of anglophile one must first understand uk geography consider these place names united kingdom is a sovereign state consisting of great britain and northern ireland officially called “united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland great britain or just “britain” is an island consisting of england wales and scotland but excluding northern ireland ireland is an island it is divided into two countries northern ireland which is one region of the united kingdom and the republic of ireland which is not part of the united kingdom england is a country and one region of the united kingdom scotland is a country and one region of the united kingdom wales is a country and one region of the united kingdom historically wales was a principality ie a territory under the jurisdiction of a prince but today it is not governed by a prince though prince charles does happen to be the prince of wales clear as dregs at the bottom of a whiskey cask right by the way    so few americans understand this basic geography about the uk that if you master it you are in an elite league a bit of humor we anglophiles just cant help ourselves we need to express our british alter egos some of us display union jacks some cross the pond every chance we get some incessantly watch bbc programming and some extreme types have even been know to affect a british accent and use a monocle and walking stick many accuse us of being an eccentric lot to which we reply why thank you here are several quizzes and lists i have found that determine whether youre an anglophile gluck are you an anglophile nonbrits only quizare you an anglophile quizyou know youre an anglophile if listyou know youre an anglophile when lista more definitive answer so back to the question “what is an anglophile” a lover of england yes but what about lovers of the uk of britain of wales andor scotland i see no reason to push those folks out from under the “anglophile” umbrella—at least not here on anglophiles united now if the only division of the uk someone adores is ireland then i might gently bulk at calling them an anglophile here’s why i think the irish culture is singular enough—and vibrant enough and strong enough—to compete with the rest of the uk’s culture to lump it with the rest of the uks culture would show a failure to recognize this singularity many i’m sure would argue that the same is true of scottish culture but while i greatly admire the uniqueness of scottish culture i do consider it a closer cousin to english culture than northern ireland’s so here at anglophiles united when talking about anglophiles i’m generally referencing great britain—or sometimes depending on the context the uk but everyone is welcome shall i contact merriamwebster to quibble about their definition ha ha i think notgaining a clearer picture of an anglophile still not sure what an anglophile is then simply click through the pages of anglophiles united and you will soon peer into the soul of the anglophile seeing what we think about and care about
