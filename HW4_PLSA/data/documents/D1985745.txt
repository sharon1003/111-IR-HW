playing dvds with windows media player 11posted in applications and windows  last updated jul 25 2008i have windows media player 11 installed on my windows vista desktop and was surprised when i went to play a dvd and a dialog window popped up to tell me that windows media player cannot play dvd video you have to ask what sort of media player wmp is when it cant play dvds and many other useful codecs like mp3 and xviddiv x a quick search on google provided the answer which i will show in the post below the error message the offending error message is shown below in a screenshot the full text of the error message is windows media player cannot play dvd video you might need to adjust your windows display settings open display settings in control panel and then try lowering your screen resolution and color quality settings i pitty the poor people who actually take that advice and mess around with their screen resolution and color settings only to discover wmp still wont play dvds it could at least say something like i cant play dvds instead of this lame excuse so you have two alternatives1 download an alternative media player if you decide to do away with windows media player altogether then you can instead go for a media player like vlc media player which is cross platform and supports a wide variety of music and video formats out of the box download vlc media player for windows osx and for linux and others from the main download page2 download a codec pack you can plug codecs into windows media player should you decided you want to continue to use it i already had the vista codec pack installed for playing div xxvid but i guess it didnt have the necessary stuff to be able to play dvds a quick google and i discovered the klite codec pack which you can download from the freecodecscom website here i downloaded it and ran the installer it was clever enough to work out i had the vista codec pack already installed and prompted me to see if i should uninstall it when i agreed it automatically opened up the uninstaller for the vista codec pack and then resumed the install after it had uninstalled very cool the first screenshot below shows the options you are presented with when installing there are a large number of codecs available plus you can also choose whether or not to install windows media player classic as well the next screenshot shows the profile sections drop down box profile 2 does the same default install as the profile 1 but doesnt install the player which you can also do by unticking the box next to media player classic when you are done selecting the profile andor codecs to install keep clicking next install etc until the application installs then when its done youll be able to play dvds as well as a whole bunch of other media formats in windows media player that download link again httpwwwfreecodecscomdownloadklitecodecpackhtm comments
