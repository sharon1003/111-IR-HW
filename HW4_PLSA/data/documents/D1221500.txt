asexual stages types of canker diseases annual cankers fusarium canker persistent perennial cankers nectria canker eutypella canker butternut canker  goodbye butternut conditional cankers cytospora canker beech bark disease diffuse cankers chestnut blight sudden oak death pitch canker hypoxylon canker what is a canker canker localized necrosis of the bark and cambium on stems branches or twigs they are often sunken because the stem continues to get bigger elsewhere also callus may be produced around the canker that makes it more sunken what causes cankers pathogens are mostly ascomycota many also have an asexual stage in the deuteromycota there are some diseases usually considered with other groups that also involve cankers canker rots some basidiomycetes that decay wood in the stem may also kill patches of sapwood and bark we consider them along with stemdecay fungi stem rusts these cause cankers but we consider them separately foliage diseases shoot and tip blights some of these kinds of diseases also can involve cankers of twigs branches and even main stems frost or sunscald these can kill patches of bark causing cankers how do canker pathogens get in what is the infection court  it is amazing for how few of them we really know how the pathogen gets in we think that generally none of them penetrate intact bark often cankers are centered around a wound or branch stub suggesting that they were the infection court but seeing a branch at the center does not tell us much did the pathogen colonize the branch or stub after it was dead then attack the nearby living stem or did it infect the branch while it was alive perhaps through some kind of wound and then grow down into the stem killing the branch in the process sexual vs asexual stages some people have trouble with this cankers are a good topic for examples for example the pathogen of coralspot nectria canker has both sexual and asexualfruiting structures that occur separately the sexual structure is in the perithecial ascomycetes characteristic of the genus nectria and the fungus is called nectria cinnabarina the asexual structure is a sporodochium fungi with sporodochia are classified in the deuteromycota this particular sporodochium and conidia it produces belong in the genus tubercularia and this one is tubercularia vulgaris so the fungus has two names both referring to the same fungus if we want to refer to the whole fungus as we usually do it is usually best to use the name for the sexual stage because as with plants that is the stage usually used to indicate relationships so we call this pathogen nectria cinnabarina but you may also hear people refer to the asexual stage by name for some fungi though we may just see the asexual stage cytospora canker is an example we almost always only see pycnidia so it is natural to call it by the stage that we see cytospora or leucocytospora for some fungi a sexual stage may never have been seen pitch canker is an example all we see are sporodochia so we can use only the name for the asexual stage which in this case is fusarium in other cases there may be both stages but the sexual stage is so consistently present that we dont need to use the name for the other stage and there may not be one hypoxylon canker is an example there are conidia but you never hear a name for that stage there are almost always perithecia around to identify types of canker diseases the most straightforward division of cankers is into annual and perennial  annual cankers last for only one year and the host then puts an end to them the necrotic areas are callused over sometimes evidence can be seen on the bark surface for years afterward as an irregularity over the callus in a cross section of the stem right annual cankers show up as small dark lines that follow an annual ring for a short distance and are covered by a bit of callus persistent perennial cankers last for multiple years but dont usually girdle the stem unless it is very small when infected they dont expand rapidly sometimes a layer of callus is produced and killed each year when the host is active it makes a roll of callus to try to heal the pathogen lays low when the host is dormant the pathogen grows and kills the callus and perhaps a bit more this leads to concentric rings of callus giving the appearance of a target and the name target canker the diagram at right shows the target appearance of the canker and a view of the crosssection additional categories that may be separated out for recognition are conditional cankers causing cankers under special conditions such as weakened trees and diffuse cankers these categories can be somewhat subjective but may be useful in considering hostpathogen relationships conditional cankers sometimes referred to as saprobic canker fungi although they are not strictly saprobes are actually facultative parasites they are normally saprobes perhaps colonizing dead twigs or old sloughedoff bark under certain conditions that we usually interpret as stressful to the host these fungi are able to overcome the host defenses and cause cankers this does not mean they are not damaging for instance they may kill a host that otherwise might recover from temporary stress diffuse cankers are those in which necrosis spreads fairly rapidly so that the host does not build barriers wound periderm and callus to stop and heal it these are not exclusive categories because a weak pathogen may cause a diffuse canker certainly most diffuse cankers are perennial probably the difference between diffuse cankers and other perennial cankers is that diffuse cankers expand also during the growing season well consider at least one canker of each kind annual cankers fusarium canker fusarium canker of maples occurs in northeast maybe midwest too cottonwoods get a fusarium canker too but the pathogen is different from less than an inch to several feet long vertically small ones are most common one tree may have hundreds of these annual cankers the cankers are evident as a ridge of bark after callusing over the face may not open usually there is no impact on tree growth but lumber is badly degraded fruiting is usually not seen the pathogen may get in through dead and dying shoots it apparently grows during the dormant season we think predisposition is involved especially drought so maybe this could go into the conditional canker category persistent perennial cankers most persistent perennial cankers have the appearance that give them the term target canker remember how these cankers forms be sure you can relate appearance of canker face to crosssection and understand how it develops over time these lessen value of trees by interrupting log length cull for low stem infections that can be 50 loss they also can serve as infection courts for decay fungi they also can predispose the tree to snapping even without decay what do you think would be a good general approach to management of stands with these cankers take them out preferentially during any cutting operation this may not be the greatest control but is all we have in most cases it is sufficient good to recognize early stages of the cankers nectria canker this is the most characteristic target canker the best example usually get nice annual roll of callus lasts for many years dont usually kill trees many hardwoods susceptible canker face is usually free of bark making it neat but it may have bark on aspen we rarely see fruiting of the pathogen it probably fruits mostly in certain years when weather is right and then in the dormant season when were not around to see it eutypella canker this is another persistent perennial canker it differs from nectria canker in several respects it is primarily restricted to maples the target appearance is usually not so clear cankers often have flaring margins like a cobra why not call it cobra canker  and the bark tends to stay on fruiting can usually be found black perithecia embedded in the bark with long necks sticking out under the bark at the advancing margin of an active canker mycelial fans can be found butternut canker  goodbye butternut butternut  juglans cinerea is naturally an uncommon tree through most of its range us northeast midwest and northern southeast and adjacent provinces of canada beginning in 1967 increasing mortality was observed and soon linked to the disease no other hosts are significantly affected live butternut has decreased as much as 80 percent in much of its range most remaining trees are diseased in many areas it is anticipated that butternut will be nearly extirpated in a few decades some states have declared a moratorium on harvest of live butternut it is now listed in category 2 under consideration on the list of endangered and threatened plants it is a sensitive species on national forest system lands and in canada it was listed as endangered in 2005 pathogen the pathogen was previously unknown sadistic mycologists  gave it a tortured name that noone can pronounce sirococcus clavigignentijuglandacearum it produces pycnidia a new species such as this causing novel severe damage to a host in its native range leads us to suspect that the pathogen is introduced but there is no direct evidence disease cankers may appear anywhere on the tree they are common on the stem base and on exposed roots presumably because spores are washed there in rain and accumulate cankers exude black liquid in spring leaving a sooty residue older cankers are perennial and have successive callus layers conditional cankers cytospora canker there are many different cytospora cankers on different hosts see the  cankers on parade  page for details normally not a big deal in natural stands more for trees growing out of native range or offsite during droughty periods such trees can be hit pretty hard also severely pruned trees or cuttings in storage or in propagation beds can be attacked a wound or shedding twig is the infection court patch of bark is killed may or may not get surrounded by callus pycnidia are very abundant and appear as pimples in the bark surface they have multiple chambers in a sort of pycnidial stroma join up at the pore like chestnut blight pathogen to which it is closely related when wet they extrude spores which often form a tendril may look like pus oozing out completing the pimple analogy it looks like a curly thread beech bark disease another introduced disease but this is a bit more complicated than the others as far as the causal agent goes there are two organisms that must occur for beech bark disease one is a scale insect the other is a nectria the scale was introduced to nova scotia about 1890 its first us find was in massachussetts in 1929 the fungus was not found until 1929 but we dont know if it was introduced or just not noticed before the disease has spread much more slowly than did chestnut blight it is still moving south and southwest the main front is about in virginia and ohio but there are pockets in advance of that the disease requires a sequence the scale appears first then the fungus appears and the scale seems to be no longer necessary in some way the scale appears to block the defenses of the tree think of it as a local anasthetic like a mosquito uses the scale numbs the bark so the tree doesnt respond and slap it down but then the fungus can get in and it doesnt go away until the bark is dead in that patch perithecia are red and superficial in clusters nice sign see under nectria canker above the canker may be diffuse or there may be host response that stops the fungus irregular blocky bark is an indication of some kind of resistance response as it began killing beech in large numbers there was a flurry of interest in it pathologists sorted out the causal agents determined how the disease was spreading and the response of the trees etc but interest soon dropped because foresters saw this as a good thing beech is an ok lumber tree but very abundant and maple and birch are usually more valuable in fact the reason beech was so abundant is that it was left behind when the more valuable birch and maples were harvested preferentially that practice of taking the most valuable trees and to hell with the rest is called highgrading and is responsible for many of the modern problems in forest management here was a pathogen helping the foresters for a changehowever it soon became apparent that the disease was leaving behind not stands of maple and birch but stands of beech sprouts thickets beech sprouts very well when the top is killed or when a stand is salvaged some old trees survive but they are deformed and defective diffuse cankers chestnut blight see the separate page on chestnut blight but have plenty of kleenex ready because this is a very sad story sudden oak death see the separate page on sudden oak death pitch canker see the separate page on pitch canker hypoxylon canker this is a common disease of aspen it is the most important aspen disease in many areas it kills aspen and in some cases can essentially make a stand worthless stands with up to 70 mortality have been reported wounds may be the infection court but we dont know for sure stem infections often originate from small branches understocked stands have much higher incidence and stand edges have higher incidence of cankers than stand interiors is that related to distribution of an insect that causes the wounds near the margin of the canker small pillars develop underneath the outer bark lifting it off in small sheets conidia develop on and between these pillars apparently functioning as fertilizing elements  spermatia  later small black stromata appear each with about a dozen perithecia these are abundant and easily seen the outer bark on aspen is light greenish it turns yellow to orange at margin of canker inner bark turns black when killed and gets exposed when the papery outer bark peels off also the stromata are black so cankers have a saltandpepper look want the nittygritty on more canker diseases table of diseases go for it once you learn
