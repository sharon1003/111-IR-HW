homemade matzo meal40 comments april 2 2012perhaps this is to be filed under the “obvious” category but still i feel the need to post this the other day i was wandering around my local supermarket looking for something – what i can’t remember anymore there were two ladies talking behind me and one lamented that she’s been all over this neighborhood trying to find matzo meal but no one had it what was she to do this weekend come passover normally i don’t eavesdrop on others’ conversations and in the rare case i do i certainly don’t walk over and give them advice but in this case i felt that it would be wrong not to say something“sorry to butt in” i said “but your problems are easily solved if you have a food processor”the ladies were listening“well you just stick some pieces of matzo in your food processor and pulverize them until you get them finely ground sort of like making your own breadcrumbs”“are you serious” one of the ladies was incredulous “that’s all that matzo meal is you’ve just solved a huge problem for me”and with that she grabbed a few boxes of matzo and headed towards the checkout this made me think that perhaps it’s not a widely known fact that matzo meal is simply ground up matzo – a breadcrumbs substitute over the holiday so if you find yourself in need of matzo meal and only boxes of matzo lying around just grind them up – and voila matzo meal in mere seconds print matzo meal makes about 12 cup2 sheets matzo broken into several pieces in a food processor fitted with a blade matzo pieces process until the matzo forms a finely ground mixture

to people apparently it’s not6 years ago radish brian – i am kind of embarrassed even writing up a “recipe” for it but i wonder if it’s more of a no brainer for you and me and less so for many other folks6 years ago margarita i have on more than a few occasions talked to strangers at grocery stores about random things i overhear in conversations i feel embarrassed butting in but i can’t help it i feel like i would be doing a disservice if i don’t offer what i know so thanks for sharing this information 6 years ago denise  creative kitchen i love this tip i think it’s fine to offer up advice usually most people talking in the aisle know others hear them…so no worries jumped over from google plus 6 years agome  theintentionalme last friday i shopped six stores trying to gather everything i needed for our multiculturalmultireligion family to make it through passover and easter never mind that it is also my daughter’s birthday and fulfilling her request for a pink and purple birthday cake was a trip unto itself i had a brief thought as i cursed the fact that whole foods only had whole wheat matzo meal that i should be able to whiz up some in the food processor but i didn’t want to mess with the matzo balls if you know what i mean thanks next time i will stop at five stores 6 years ago amy i teach in a synagogue preschool and we always crush matzah inside ziplocs by whaling on them with wooden hammers and it’s not just the kids that love this part we use the homemade matzah meal to make matzah balls and i now do it at home as well works greatespecially if you prefer “sinkers” with more of a nutty taste6 years agolia it would seem obvious but when i tried it last year the “homemade” matzo meal didn’t come out as finally ground as the store bought i didn’t end up using it for baked products any thoughts6 years ago radish ila – yes you get a slightly more varied texture – a good point but i like that in my homemade matzo meal same as i prefer to make my own “irregular” breadcrumbs there’s definitely a way to smooth out the bigger guys by pounding them out – it is a bit more effort my personal complaint really is that my food processor is somewhat defective and make the most insane mess ever i’ve worked in other kitchens and it’s never nearly as bad 6 years ago rachelfood fix great story i encounter that kind of “duh ” moment all the time with my students i teach cooking with the most simple culinary facts it is interesting how little food lore is passed down anymore between the generations and how clueless people can be in the kitchen…they are so grateful for the tips and info…even in the aisles of the grocery store in the same vein…corn flour is nothing but finely ground corn meal…and almond flour nothing but finely ground almonds etc…both come in handly for glutenfree baking…happy holidays…and check out my flourless chocolate coconut cake for passover and easter on my blog6 years agosweet potato patties  sassy radish … i gave you a tip about making homemade matzo meal – i’m still embarrassed about it sort of i don’t want to presume that this is what …6 years ago amandahow intriguing i’m actually embarrassed to admit it – but i had no idea what matzo meal was until now much less how simple it was to make maybe it’s a jewishcultural thing but thank you for pointing out this “obvious” thing to me6 years ago ellen i don’t own a food processor and i’m wondering if i could try this in the blender what do you think otherwise i’ll try the manual method6 years ago radish ellen – i think if you have a good powerful blender it might do the trick could you let all of us know if it works for you6 years ago laura great post i’ll admit i’m ashamed this wasn’t a nobrainer for me in the past i’m glad our food coop forgot to order it this year and so there was a run on matzo meal in other parts of town i’ll never buy the overpriced substance again although it was a bit hard to get perfectly uniform texture in food processor i think i’ll try vitamix next time6 years ago irina the food processor is kind of magical once i realized that a lot of ingredients are really just pulverized versions of something i started trying to see if i can make them myself basically almost anything “ground” can be reproduced easily note making your own powdered sugar will scratch up the plastic bowl a bit and it will not be as powdery as you’d like and also will create a lot of sugar dust which is not pleasant just buy powdered sugar i have to say it did feel silly to have an “aha” moment when i realized that almond meal is just almonds i can pulse a few times seems obvious but only once it hits you 6 years ago annie like a previous poster i have tried this and it doesn’t come out the same now that was a long time ago so i can’t remember if i tried it for matzo balls which is what i would be making with matzo meal maybe i should try it again as the store i shop at carries matzo crackers on occasion and not matzo meal i also tried making matzo crackers once and that was a bust also mm…come to think of it maybe that was what went into the failed matzo meal6 years ago bonnie in australia hi that was very helpful advice but i have another question i live in a very multicultural area and i haven’t seen matzo before is matzo an unlevened cracker is it wheat buckwheat amaranth rice potato flour based does it have any sort of herbs i am looking at an apple tea cake recipe that is only asking for matzo meal instead of wheat flour5 years ago radish bonnie – matzo as referred to in recipes is an unleavened wheat cracker i’ve never had trouble finding it in the us but i’ve always lived in cities are you near an area that has a sizeable jewish population if so the stores should stock matzo andor matzo meal5 years ago comet i live in an area that does have a decent size jewish population in the larger towns altho i live in the wilderness and my kids were three out of the 4 jewish kids in their school for the entire time from k thru 12 our walmart apparently is not carrying matzoh meal now maybe at pesach and our local large show place multi culti price chopper is also not carrying much in the way of jewish stuff at all–they did have a package of “matzoh ball soup mix” which might have made one matzoh ball while i was standing there trying to see if they might have some hidden behind the other items another man came by looking for–matzoh meal i said jokingly that i was going to have to learn how to make my own matzoh meal at which time the poor guy looked at me like i had sprouted wings i said—but its only ground up matzohs how hard could it bei checked here to see if anyone had the “answer” to the uneven pieces yet–after 5000 years you would think that we could figure this out people but alas it is processor and zippy bag and rolling pin for me i fear if you don’t keep kosher or if you can find kosher precooked chickens i have taken to making soup out of the “rotisserie” chickens and adding herbs carrots onions celery and—one of the three “secrets” of chicken soup—half a bag of pepperidge farms herb stuffing for a large pot of soup if i make my own chicken this is already part of the recipe add this at the start after straining all of the “stuff” out prior to finishing i add a shot of tamari sauce and then—every body’s bubbe’s trick—several chicken cubes aka boullion cubes invented by a family member of oursi have found my family loves turkey matzoh ball soup even more than chicken–if that is possible5 years ago krista thanks a million i just went all over town looking for matzo meal for my first passover which i hope to wow my boyfriends parents with my matzo ball soup skills 5 years agoolga krista – good luck 5 years ago marthagreat tip but i am looking for an “actual” recipe to make the matzah meal itself from all the responses i guess i should make matzah then crush it i thought there might be a shorter method jewish people have broken left over matzah for meal seemingly forever if anyone has a shorter way to create meal…please let me know at marta s614gmailcom5 years agoolga marta – matzo meal is nothing more than crushed matzo that’s how you arrive at it you can purchase matzo in most stores around large cities but i don’t know where you live if you are near a temple you can ask a rabbi or someone to direct you to have kosher fr passover matzo and then meal it has to be approved by a rabbi ie made in compliance with the jewish law are you looking for a matzo recipe5 years agolydia what are matzol is cracker if not what can substitute for it5 years agoolga lydia – matzo is essentially a cracker made with flour and water however if it’s kosher for passover then it’s the only thing that’s allowed to be used ie you can’t just use a cracker and make a meal out of it you have to use kosher for passover matzo to make matzo meal or purchase matzo meal already made if you’re not cooking for passover you can certainly find regular matzo not approved by rabbi for k for p uses but i don’t know anything else that has just those 2 ingredients hope that helps5 years agosteve well that’s blatantly obvious but what if you cannot buy matzoh5 years agoolgasteve – where do you live that you cannot buy matzo and can you order it online5 years ago julie j have to say i laughed out loud when i found this post after coming home from 4 grocery stores disappointed because i could not find matzo meal my husband and i both have the flu and i love jewish chicken soup wmatzo balls but jerry’s deli is no longer in our neighbor so i thought i would attempt to make my own i’m going back out to the store now to buy some matzo’s to pulverize in my blendtec thanks so much for posting this5 years agoolga julie j – hope it you and your husband feel better soon5 years ago how to bake with matzo meal  culture  popular question  answer … helpful resources homemade matzo meal  sassy radish …4 years ago m tanner wow – that was really helpful information like when i learned you can make powder sugar from granulated sugar in this same way thanks to granny 4 years agosselkhis hi i’m african american and love matzo ball soup i usually get the packaged soup and cut fresh carrots celery onions and cut up some thin chicken cutlets to that i add some knorr chicken boullion cubes and lipton chicken noodle soup i make a huge pot of it and its gonelol so when a jewish friend of mine gave me like 5 boxes of matzo crackers matzo soup was the first thing that came in mind but i wasn’t sure as to how to make the “meal” i figured its just pulverized matzo crackers glad to know i was right lol so went to the good ole internet and found this post i don’t have a food processor so what i did was crush matzo in a ziplock bag then ran it through blender and presto the finest meal you can ever find so i have a big batch for future use hope this helps others3 years ago sprittibee here’s a question for the jewish listeners… we are christian but we celebrate hanukkah anyway  and we don’t eat white bread or wheat if we can avoid it however we found a wheat alternative matzo cracker that is whole grain does it really matter what type of cracker you use with your hanukkah meal or matzo ball soup if you can grind whatever cracker your family can eat that’s not breaking any unwritten rule is it  i grind all sorts of things to make “breading” for my oriental sesame chicken fingers – sometimes a blend of cornflakes sprouted grain breads etc i wonder if you could do the same for “matzo” some of the matzo ball and falafel mixes that are store bought taste like they have corn meal in them anyway…3 years agoolga sprittibee – are you asking about hannukah or passover if it’s the former then use whatever matzo cracker you like – or alternative but for passover whatever alternative you have in mind has to have rabbinical approval in order to be appropriate for the holiday outside of regular kashrut laws there’s nothing additional for hannukah but passover is a whole different ball game hope this helps matzo mixes with cornmeal are not kosher for passover3 years ago barbarai greatly appreciate your conversation with the ladies i really needed more matzoh meal to make my matzoh balls thanks again for recipe  kind o f figured thats what it was  happy passover3 years ago brittany so happy that you posted this “recipe” i was making latkes and it called for matzo meal and i was looking up a substitute since i forgot to buy it and found this post i make my own breadcrumbs for recipes i just never even thought about the fact that it’s the same thing thank you 2 years ago kath have been on a quest in the small town i live in for matzoh – and finally went onto the internet – and found several ways to make the matzoh balls as i had made the chicken soup – i was craving i matzoh ball soup because of a cold – not jewish but used to be able to fiind matzoh ball soup in any deli in toronto – and love it today i found semolina at a health food store – doesn’t look quite right to me but have read that its basically finally ground basis of the balls have also read that ground up carr’s biscuits – similar to matzoh will do in an emergency two additional comments you haven’t lived if you don’t put butter on matzoh – it is better than popcorn and i realize all of the above isn’t really kosher – and i am not trying to offend anyone – just offering some thoughts on the matter – i am going to try to make some “balls” – for the beyond delicious chicken soup i made from a whole rotisserie chicken – apparently the bones get a bit roasted in the process – so it eliminates a step –i hope this is helpful2 years ago barbara thank you for this post i was raised in an all catholic household german and irish we never had matzo but i wanted to make matzo ball soup have matzo crackers but had no idea if matzo meal was just crushed crackers big helpabout a year ago charlotte i had the same problem i appreciate your adviceabout a year ago julie i’m latin and
