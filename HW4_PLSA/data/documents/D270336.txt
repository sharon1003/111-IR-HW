at the neuromuscular junction the nerve fiber is able to transmit a signal to the muscle fiber by releasing ach and other substances causing muscle contraction muscles will contract or relax when they receive signals from the nervous system the neuromuscular junction is the site of the signal exchange the steps of this process in vertebrates occur as follows 1 the action potential reaches the axon terminal 2 voltagedependent calcium gates open allowing calcium to enter the axon terminal 3 neurotransmitter vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane and ach is released into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis 4 ach binds to postsynaptic receptors on the sarcolemma 5 this binding causes ion channels to open and allows sodium ions to flow across the membrane into the muscle cell 6 the flow of sodium ions across the membrane into the muscle cell generates an action potential which travels to the myofibril and results in muscle contraction labels a motor neuron axon b axon terminal c

terminology  edit on wikidataa neuromuscular junction or myoneural junction is a chemical synapse formed by the contact between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber 1 it is at the neuromuscular junction that a motor neuron is able to transmit a signal to the muscle fiber causing muscle contraction muscles require innervation to function—and even just to maintain muscle tone avoiding atrophy synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction begins when an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal of a motor neuron which activates voltagedependent calcium channels to allow calcium ions to enter the neuron calcium ions bind to sensor proteins  synaptotagmin on synaptic vesicles triggering vesicle fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent neurotransmitter release from the motor neuron into the synaptic cleft in vertebrates motor neurons release acetylcholine ach a small molecule neurotransmitter which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors n ach rs on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber also known as the sarcolemma n ach rs are ionotropic receptors meaning they serve as ligand gated ion channels the binding of ach to the receptor can depolarize the muscle fiber causing a cascade that eventually results in muscle contraction neuromuscular junction diseases can be of genetic and autoimmune origin genetic disorders such as duchenne muscular dystrophy can arise from mutated structural proteins that comprise the neuromuscular junction whereas autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis occur when antibodies are produced against

editmotor endplate the neuromuscular junction differs from chemical synapses between neurons presynaptic motor axons stop 30 nanometers from the sarcolemma the cell membrane of a muscle cell this 30nanometer space forms the synaptic cleft through which signalling molecules are released the sarcolemma has invaginations called postjunctional folds which increase the surface area of the membrane exposed to the synaptic cleft 2 these postjunctional folds form what is referred to as the motor endplate which possess nicotinic acetylcholine receptors n ach rs at a density of 10000 receptorsmicrometer 2 in skeletal muscle 3 the presynaptic axons form bulges called terminal boutons or presynaptic terminals that project into the postjunctional folds of the sarcolemma the presynaptic terminals have active zones that contain vesicles also called quanta full of acetylcholine molecules these vesicles can fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release ach molecules into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis after depolarization 2 ach rs are localized opposite the presynaptic terminals by protein scaffolds at the postjunctional folds of the sarcolemma dystrophin a structural protein connects the sarcomere sarcolemma and extracellular matrix components rapsyn is another protein that docks ach rs and structural proteins to the cytoskeleton also present is the receptor tyrosine kinase protein mu sk a signaling protein involved in the development of the neuromuscular junction which is also held in place by rapsyn 2mechanism of action  editthe neuromuscular junction is where a neuron activates a muscle to contract upon the arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic neuron terminal voltagedependent calcium channels open and ca 2 ions flow from the extracellular fluid into the presynaptic neurons cytosol this influx of ca 2 causes neurotransmitter containing vesicles to dock and fuse to the presynaptic neurons cell membrane through snare proteins fusion of the vesicular membrane with the presynaptic cell membrane results in the emptying of the vesicles contents acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft a process known as exocytosis acetylcholine diffuses into the synaptic cleft and can bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the motor endplate causing calcium ions to flow into the muscle cell initiating a sequence of steps that finally produce muscle contraction acetylcholine receptors  edition channel linked receptor ions ligand such as acetylcholinewhen ligands bind to the receptor the ion channel portion of the receptor opens allowing ions to pass across the cell membrane acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter synthesized from dietary choline and acetylco a aco a and is involved in the stimulation of muscle tissue in vertebrates as well as in some invertebrate animals in vertebrate animals the acetylcholine receptor subtype that is found at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor n ach r which is a ligandgated ion channel each subunit of this receptor has a characteristic cysloop which is composed of a cysteine residue followed by 13 amino acid residues and another cysteine residue the two cysteine residues form a disulfide linkage which results in the cysloop receptor that is capable of binding acetylcholine and other ligands these cysloop receptors are found only in eukaryotes but prokaryotes possess ach receptors with similar properties 3 not all species use a cholinergic neuromuscular junction eg crayfish and fruit flies have a glutamatergic neuromuscular junction 2ach rs at the skeletal neuromuscular junction form heteropentamers composed of two α one β one ɛ and one δ subunits 4 when a single ach ligand binds to one of the α subunits of the ach receptor it induces a conformational change at the interface with the second ach r α subunit this conformational change results in the increased affinity of the second α subunit for a second ach ligand ach rs therefore exhibit a sigmoidal dissociation curve due to this cooperative binding 3 the presence of the inactive intermediate receptor structure with a singlebound ligand keeps ach in the synapse that might otherwise be lost by cholinesterase hydrolysis or diffusion the persistence of these ach ligands in the synapse can cause a prolonged postsynaptic response 5development  editthe development of the neuromuscular junction requires signaling from both the motor neurons terminal and the muscle cells central region during development muscle cells produce acetylcholine receptors ach rs and express them in the central regions in a process called prepatterning agrin a heparin proteoglycan and mu sk kinase are thought to help stabilize the accumulation of ach r in the central regions of the myocyte mu sk is a receptor tyrosine kinase —meaning that it induces cellular signaling by binding phosphate molecules to self regions like tyrosines and to other targets in the cytoplasm 6 upon activation by its ligand agrin mu sk signals via two proteins called  dok7  and  rapsyn  to induce clustering of acetylcholine receptors 7 ach release by developing motor neurons produces postsynaptic potentials in the muscle cell that positively reinforces the localization and stabilization of the developing neuromuscular junction 8these findings were demonstrated in part by mouse  knockout  studies in mice which are deficient for either agrin or mu sk the neuromuscular junction does not form further mice deficient in dok7 did not form either acetylcholine receptor clusters or neuromuscular synapses 9the development of neuromuscular junctions is mostly studied in model organisms such as rodents in addition in 2015 an allhuman neuromuscular junction has been created in vitro using human embryonic stem cells and somatic muscle stem cells 10 in this model presynaptic motor neurons are activated by optogenetics and in response synaptically connected muscle fibers twitch upon light stimulation research methods  editjosé del castillo and bernard katz used ionophoresis to determine the location and density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors n ach rs at the neuromuscular junction with this technique a microelectrode was placed inside the motor endplate of the muscle fiber and a micropipette filled with acetylcholine ach is placed directly in front of the endplate in the synaptic cleft a positive voltage was applied to the tip of the micropipette which caused a burst of positively charged ach molecules to be released from the pipette these ligands flowed into the space representing the synaptic cleft and bound to ach rs the intracellular microelectrode monitored the amplitude of the depolarization of the motor endplate in response to ach binding to nicotinic ionotropic receptors katz and del castillo showed that the amplitude of the depolarization  excitatory postsynaptic potential depended on the proximity of the micropipette releasing the ach ions to the endplate the farther the micropipette was from the motor endplate the smaller the depolarization was in the muscle fiber this allowed the researchers to determine that the nicotinic receptors were localized to the motor endplate in high density 2 3toxins are also used to determine the location of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction αbungarotoxin is a toxin found in the snake species bungarus multicinctus that acts as an ach antagonist and binds to ach rs irreversibly by coupling assayable enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase hrp or fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein gfp to the αbungarotoxin ach rs can be visualized and quantified 2toxins that affect the neuromuscular junction  editnerve gases  editnerve gases and liquor damage this area botulinum toxin  editbotulinum toxin aka botulinum neurotoxin bo nt and sold under the trade name botox inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by interfering with snare proteins 2 this toxin crosses into the nerve terminal through the process of endocytosis and subsequently interferes with snare proteins which are necessary for ach release by doing so it induces a transient flaccid paralysis and chemical denervation localized to the striated muscle that it has affected the inhibition of the ach release does not set in until approximately two weeks after the injection is made three months after the inhibition occurs neuronal activity begins to regain partial function and six months complete neuronal function is regained 11tetanus toxin  edittetanus toxin also known as tetanospasmin is a potent neurotoxin produced by clostridium tetani and causes the disease state tetanus the ld 50 of this toxin has been measured to be approximately 1 ngkg making it second only to botulinum toxin d as the deadliest toxin in the world it functions very similarly to botunlinum neurotoxin bo nt by attaching and endocytosing into the presynaptic nerve terminal and interfering with snare protein complexes it differs from bo nt in a few ways most apparently in its end state wherein tetanospasmin demonstrates a rigid  spastic paralysis as opposed to the flaccid paralysis demonstrated with bo nt latrotoxin  editlatrotoxin αlatrotoxin found in venom of widow spiders also affects the neuromuscular junction by causing the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic cell mechanisms of action include binding to receptors on the presynaptic cell activating the ip3dag pathway and release of calcium from intracellular stores and pore formation resulting in influx of calcium ions directly either mechanism causes increased calcium in presynaptic cell which then leads to release of synaptic vesicles of acetylcholine latrotoxin causes pain muscle contraction and if untreated potentially paralysis and death snake venom  editsnake venoms act as toxins at the neuromuscular junction and can induce weakness and paralysis venoms can act as both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins 12presynaptic neurotoxins commonly known as βneurotoxins affect the presynaptic regions of the neuromuscular junction the majority of these neurotoxins act by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine into the synapse between neurons however some of these toxins have also been known to enhance neurotransmitter release those that inhibit neurotransmitter release create a neuromuscular blockade that prevents signaling molecules from reaching their postsynaptic target receptors in doing so the victim of these snake bite suffer from profound weakness such neurotoxins do not respond well to antivenoms after one hour of inoculation of these toxins including notexin and taipoxin many of the affected nerve terminals show signs of irreversible physical damage leaving them devoid of any synaptic vesicles 12postsynaptic neurotoxins otherwise known as αneurotoxins act oppositely to the presynaptic neurotoxins by binding to the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors this prevents interaction between the acetylcholine released by the presynaptic terminal and the receptors on the postsynaptic cell in effect the opening of sodium channels associated with these acetylcholine receptors is prohibited resulting in a neuromuscular blockade similar to the effects seen due to presynaptic neurotoxins this causes paralysis in the muscles involved in the affected junctions unlike presynaptic neurotoxins postsynaptic toxins are more easily affected by antivenoms which accelerate the dissociation of the toxin from the receptors ultimately causing a reversal of paralysis these neurotoxins experimentally and qualitatively aid in the study of acetylcholine receptor density and turnover as well as in studies observing the direction of antibodies toward the affected acetylcholine receptors in patients diagnosed with myasthenia gravis 12diseases  editmain article neuromuscular junction disease any disorder that compromises the synaptic transmission between a motor neuron and a muscle cell is categorized under the umbrella term of neuromuscular diseases these disorders can be inherited or acquired and can vary in their severity and mortality in general most of these disorders tend to be caused by mutations or autoimmune disorders autoimmune disorders in the case of neuromuscular diseases tend to be humoral mediated b cell mediated and result in an antibody improperly created against a motor neuron or muscle fiber protein that interferes with synaptic transmission or signaling autoimmune  editmyasthenia gravis  editmyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder where the body makes antibodies against either the acetylcholine receptor ach r in 80 of cases or against postsynaptic musclespecific kinase mu sk 0–10 of cases in seronegative myasthenia gravis low density lipoprotein receptorrelated protein 4 is targeted by ig g1 which acts as a competitive inhibitor of its ligand preventing the ligand from binding its receptor it is not known if seronegative myasthenia gravis will respond to standard therapies 13neonatal mg  editneonatal mg is an autoimmune disorder that affects 1 in 8 children born to mothers who have been diagnosed with myasthenia gravis mg mg can be transferred from the mother to the fetus by the movement of ach r antibodies through the placenta signs of this disease at birth include weakness which responds to anticholinesterase medications as well as fetal akinesia or the lack of fetal movement this form of the disease is transient lasting for about three months however in some cases neonatal mg can lead to other health effects such as arthrogryposis and even fetal death these conditions are thought to be initiated when maternal ach r antibodies are directed to the fetal ach r and can last until the 33rd week of gestation when the γ subunit of ach r is replaced by the ε subunit 14lamberteaton myasthenic syndrome  editlamberteaton myasthenic syndrome lems is an autoimmune disorder that affects the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction this rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms proximal muscle weakness autonomic dysfunction and areflexia 15 proximal muscle weakness is a product of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against pqtype voltagegated calcium channels which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by lems include erectile dysfunction in men constipation and most commonly dry mouth less common dysfunctions include dry eyes and altered perspiration areflexia is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise 1650–60 of the patients that are diagnosed with lems also have present an associated tumor which is typically smallcell lung carcinoma sclc this type of tumor also expresses voltagegated calcium channels 16 oftentimes lems also occurs alongside myasthenia gravis 15treatment for lems consists of using 34diaminopyridine as a first measure which serves to increase the compound muscle action potential as well as muscle strength by lengthening the time that voltagegated calcium channels remain open after blocking voltagegated potassium channels in the us treatment with 34diaminopyridine for eligible lems patients is available at no cost under an expanded access program 17 18 further treatment includes the use of prednisone and azathioprine in the event that 34diaminopyridine does not aid in treatment 16neuromyotonia  editneuromyotonia nmt otherwise known as isaac’s syndrome is unlike many other diseases present at the neuromuscular junction rather than causing muscle weakness nmt leads to the hyperexcitation of motor nerves nmt causes this hyperexcitation by producing longer depolarizations by downregulating voltagegated potassium channels which causes greater neurotransmitter release and repetitive firing this increase in rate of firing leads to more active transmission and as a result greater muscular activity in the affected individual nmt is also believed to be of autoimmune origin due to its associations with autoimmune symptoms in the individual affected 14genetic  editcongenital myasthenic syndromes  editcongenital myasthenic syndromes cms are very similar to both mg and lems in their functions but the primary difference between cms and those diseases is that cms is of genetic origins specifically these syndromes are diseases incurred due to mutations typically recessive in 1 of at least 10 genes that affect presynaptic synaptic and postsynaptic proteins in the neuromuscular junction such mutations usually arise in the εsubunit of ach r 14 thereby affecting the kinetics and expression of the receptor itself single nucleotide substitutions or deletions may cause loss of function in the subunit other mutations such as those affecting acetylcholinesterase and acetyltransferase can also cause the expression of cms with the latter being associated specifically with episodic apnea 19 these syndromes can present themselves at different times within the life of an individual they may arise during the fetal phase causing fetal akinesia or the perinatal period during which certain conditions such as arthrogryposis ptosis hypotonia ophthalmoplegia and feeding or breathing difficulties may be observed they could also activate during adolescence or adult years causing the individual to develop slowchannel syndrome 14treatment for particular subtypes of cms postsynaptic fastchannel cms 20 21 is similar to treatment for other neuromuscular disorders 34diaminopyridine the firstline treatment for lems is under development as an orphan drug for cms 22 in the us and available to eligible patients under an expanded access program at no cost 17 18bulbospinal muscular atrophy  editbulbospinal muscular atrophy also known as kennedy’s disease is a rare recessive trinucleotide polyglutamine disorder that is linked to the x chromosome because of its linkage to the x chromosome it is typically transmitted through females however kennedy’s disease is only present in adult males and the onset of the disease is typically later in life this disease is specifically caused by the expansion of a cagtandem repeat in exon 1 found on the androgenreceptor ar gene on chromosome xq 1112 polyqexpanded ar accumulates in the nuclei of cells where it begins to fragment after fragmentation degradation of the cell begins leading to a loss of both motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia 23symptoms of kennedy’s disease include weakness and wasting of the facial bulbar and extremity muscles as well as sensory and endocrinological disturbances such as gynecomastia and reduced fertility other symptoms include elevated testosterone and other sexual hormone levels development of hyperckemia abnormal conduction through motor and sensory nerves and neuropathic or in rare cases myopathic alterations on biopsies of muscle cells 23duchenne muscular dystrophy  editduchenne muscular dystrophy is an xlinked genetic disorder that results in the absence of the structural protein dystrophin at the neuromuscular junction it affects 1 in 3600–6000 males and frequently causes death by the age of 30 the absence of dystrophin causes muscle degeneration and patients present with the following symptoms abnormal gait hypertrophy in the calf muscles and elevated creatine kinase if left untreated patients may suffer from respiratory distress which can lead to death 24see also  editsynapse skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neuroeffector junction external links  edithistology image
