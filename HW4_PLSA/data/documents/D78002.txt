how do you split a cell in excel by using the text to columns feature flash fill formulas or split text tool this tutorial outlines all the options to help you choose the technique best suited for your particular task generally you may need to divide cells in excel in two cases most often when you import data from some external source where all information is in one column while you want it in separate columns or you may want to separate cells in an existing table for better filtering sorting or a detailed analysis how to split cells in excel using text to columns how to separate cells excel 2013 and 2016 with fill flash how to divide a cell with excel formulas how to split data in excel cell with the split text tool how to split cells in excel using text to columns the text to columns feature comes in really handy when you need to divide a single cell into two or more cells in excel 2016 2013 2010 and earlier it allows splitting text strings by a specified delimiter such as comma semicolon or space as well as separating substrings of a fixed length lets see how each scenario works how to separate cells in excel by delimiter suppose you have a list of participants where a participant name country and expected arrival date are all in the same column what we want is to separate data in one cell into several cells such as first name  last name  country  arrival date and status to have it done perform the following steps if you want to put the split cells in the middle of your table start by inserting a new column s to avoid overwriting your existing data in this example we have inserted 3 new columns like shown in the screenshot below if you dont have any data next to the column you want to separate skip this step select the cells you want to divide navigate to the data tab  data tools group and click the text to columns button in the first step of the convert text to columns wizard you choose how to split cells  by delimiter or width in our case the cell contents are separated with spaces and commas so we select delimited and click next in the next step you specifythe delimiters and optionally text qualifier you can choose one or more predefined delimiters as well as type your own one in the other box in this example we select space and comma tips treat consecutive delimiters as one be sure to select this option when your data may contain two or more delimiters in a row eg when there are a few consecutive spaces between words or the data is separate by a comma and a space like smith john specifying the text qualifier  use this option when some text is enclosed in single or double quotes and youd like such portions of text to be inseparable for example if you choose a comma  as the delimiter and a quotation mark  as the text qualifier then any words enclosed in double quotes eg california usa will be put into one cell as california usa if you select none as the text qualifier then california will be distributed into one cell together with an opening quotation mark and usa into another together with a closing mark data preview before you click the next button it stands to reason to scroll through the data preview section to make sure excel has split all cells contents right just two more things are left for you to do  choose the data format and specify where you want to paste split data data format by default the general format is set for all columns which works well in most cases in our example we need the data format for the arrival dates to change the data format for a particular column click on that column under data preview to select it and then choose one of the formats under column data format please see the screenshot below destination to tell excel where you want to output the separated data click the collapse dialog icon next to the destination box and select the topleftmost cell of the destination range or type a cell reference directly in the box please be very careful with this option and make sure there are enough empty columns right to the destinaton cell notes if you do not want to import some column that appears in the data preview select that column and check do not import column skip radio button under column data format it is not possible to import the split data to another spreadsheet or workbook if you attempt to do this you will get the invalid destination error finally click the finish button and you are done as shown in the below screenshot excel has perfectly split the contents of one cell into several cells how to split text of a fixed width this section explains how to divide a cell in excel based on the number of characters you specify to make things easier to understand please consider the following example supposing you have product ids and product names in one column and you want to extract the ids into a separate column since all of the product ids contain 9 characters the fixed width option fits perfectly for the job start the convert text to columns wizard as explained in the above example in the first step of the wizard choose fixed width and click next set the width of each column by using the data preview section as shown in the screenshot below a vertical line represents a column break and to create a new break line you simply click at the desired position 9 characters in our case to remove the break doubleclick a line to move a break in another position simply drag the line with the mouse in the next step choose the data format and destination for the split cells exactly as we did in the previous example and click the finish button to complete the separation how to separate cells excel 2013 and 2016 with fill flash if you use one of the recent versions of excel 2013 or excel 2016 you can benefit from the flash fill feature that can not only automatically populate cells with data but also split cell contents if you are not familiar with this excel feature ill briefly explain the concept flash fill analyzes the data you are entering and endeavors to figure out what result you are trying to achieve once it determines a pattern a series of suggestions appears in a new column in a flash hence the name and now lets take a column of data from our first example and see how excels flash fill can help us split a cell in half insert a new column next to the column with the original data and type the desired part of the text in the first cell participant name in this example type the text in a couple more cells as soon as excel senses a pattern it will populate similar data into other cells automatically in our case its taken 3 cells for excel to figure out a pattern if you are happy with what you see press the enter key and all the names will be copied to a separate column at once tips the flash fill feature is turned on by default if it does not work for you go to file  options click advanced and select the automatically flash fill box in the editing options if flash fill is enabled but does not work automatically try to run it manually for this go to the data tab  data tools group and click the flash fill button how to split cell in excel with formulas whatever diverse information your cells may contain a formula to split a cell in excel boils down to finding a position of the delimiter comma space etc and extracting a substring before after or inbetween the delimiters generally youd use search or find functions to determine the delimiters location and one of the text functions  left right or mid to get a substring for example youd use the following formulas to split data in cell a2 separated with a comma and space please see the screenshot below to extract the name in b2 left a2 search a21to extract the country in c2 right a2len a2search a21for the detailed explanation of the logic and more formula examples to divide cells in excel please check out the following resources extract text before a specific character get a substring after a certain character extract text
