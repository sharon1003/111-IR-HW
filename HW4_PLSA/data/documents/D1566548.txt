the acid base theory of brønsted and lowry return to the acid base menu i introduction in 1923 within several months of each other johannes nicolaus brønsted denmark and thomas martin lowry england published essentially the same theory about how acids and bases behave since they came to their conclusions independently of each other both names have been used for the theory name since the chem team does not yet have access to information about how each came to their conclusions we will move right into a description of the theory however brønsted does focus on the concept of base in his article so it seems possible that the problems with bases especially ammonia in arrhenius theory was where he found his inspiration ii the acid base theory using the words of brønsted   acids and bases are substances that are capable of splitting off or taking up hydrogen ions respectively or an acidbase reaction consists of the transfer of a proton from an acid to a base keep this thought in mind here is a more recent way to say the same thing an acid is a substance from which a proton can be removed a base is a substance that can remove a proton from an acid remember proton hydrogen ion and h  all mean the same thing very common in the chemistry world is this definition set an acid is a proton donor a base is a proton acceptor in fact your teacher may define acids and bases this way and insist that you give those definitions back on the test ok go ahead and do it but please recognize that the truth is slightly different than donor and acceptor imply in an acid the hydrogen ion is bonded to the rest of the molecule it takes energy sometimes a little sometimes a lot to break that bond so the acid molecule does not give or donate the proton it has it taken away in the same sense you do not donate your wallet to the pickpocket you have it removed from you the base is a molecule with a builtin drive to collect protons as soon as the base approaches the acid it will if it is strong enough rip the proton off the acid molecule and add it to itself now this is where all the fun stuff comes in that you get to learn you see some bases are stronger than others meaning some have a large desire for protons while other bases have a weaker drive its the same way with acids some have very weak bonds and the proton is easy to pick off while other acids have stronger bonds making it harder to get the proton the chem team realizes that this is sorta like life itself some people seem driven to go parachuting while the chem team figures it is insanity itself to jump out of a perfectly good air plane some people are driven to climb mt everest while the chem team says oh look at the pretty picture of mt everest one important contribution coming from lowry has to do with the state of the hydrogen ion in solution in bronsteds announcement of the theory he used h  lowry in his paper actually a long letter to the editor used the h 3 o  that is commonly used today here is what lowry had to sayit is a remarkable fact that strong acidity is apparently developed only in mixtures and never in pure compounds even hydrogen chloride only becomes an acid when mixed with water this can be explained by the extreme reluctance of a hydrogen nucleus to lead an isolated existence the effect of mixing hydrogen chloride with water is probably to provide an acceptor for the hydrogen nucleus so that the ionisation of the acid only involves the transfer of a proton from one octet to another cl h  h 2 o ⇌ cl¯  oh 3 lowry also draws this equilibrium with all the electron dots to show the full octetsthe ionised acid is then really an ionised oxonium saltt m lowry the uniqueness of hydrogen chemistry and industry 42 19 january 1923 pp4347 iii sample equations written in the brønstedlowry style a reactions that proceed to a large extent hcl  h 2 o ⇌ h 3 o   cl¯hcl  this is an acid because it has a proton available to be transfered h 2 o  this is a base since it gets the proton that the acid lost now here comes an interesting idea h 3 o   this is an acid because it can give a proton cl¯  this is a base since it has the capacity to receive a proton notice that each pair hcl and cl¯ as well as h 2 o and h 3 o  differ by one proton symbol  h   these pairs are called conjugate pairs click the sentence for the terminology to cover this idea hno 3  h 2 o ⇌ h 3 o   no 3 ¯the acids are hno 3 and h 3 o  and the bases are h 2 o and no 3 ¯ remember that an acidbase reaction is a competition between two bases think about it for a proton if the stronger of the two acids and the stronger of the two bases are reactants appear on the left side of the equation the reaction is said to proceed to a large extent b reactions that proceed to a small extent if the weaker of the two acids and the weaker of the two bases are reactants appear on the left side of the equation the reaction is said to proceed to only a small extent hc 2 h 3 o 2  h 2 o ⇌ h 3 o   c 2 h 3 o 2 ¯nh 3  h 2 o ⇌ nh 4  oh¯identify the conjugage acid base pairs in each reaction get the answers iv problems with the theory this theory works very nicely in all protic solvents water ammonia acetic acid etc  but fails to explain acid base behavior in aprotic solvents such as benzene and dioxane that job will be left for a more general theory such as the lewis theory of acids and bases return to the
