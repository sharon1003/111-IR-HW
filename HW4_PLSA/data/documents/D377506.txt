years age and it’s been heaving live in wisconsin what can i do to stop the heaving i did put drainage tile under the patio blocks the blocks are 16 by 16 i have at least 4 inches of sand base with a wood frame to hold the patio blocks can some one give me some ideas thank you marggo ben erickson says march 8th 2011 at 756 am hi norm thanks for the insights on how to lay patio pavers over a concrete slabnorm crothers says march 7th 2011 at 1112 pm on the question of laying pavers over an existing concrete base we had pavers put down in our garage and entrance apron the “experts” laid them on cement and cemented in the joints about 316″ gap left as they had to take about 12 ton or more on any one paver when you parked in there and not move if you applied the brakes firmly worked fine 8 years now a little later i got a landscaper to lay the same pavers on our patio area over dirt and on an upstairs concrete balcony on this occasion the “experts” laid the balcony pavers on sand over the concrete but cemented about 3 or 4″ in from each edge to hold everything in place and cemented between the pavers again left about 316″ gap this has also worked well it was much much much quicker to lay on sand so it cost me a lot lessben erickson says february 17th 2011 at 452 pm hi danny laying a paver patio over a tree stump wouldn’t be a good idea since as the wood rotted the ground would tend to sink unless the tree was a rot resistant wood that will be be there a long time you’d be better off digging up the stump filling in the hole and compacting the dirt before laying your patio good luck with your projectdanny says february 17th 2011 at 143 pm i have a dead roots and stump that was grinded down to the level of the earth can i just pour gravel and sand over the dirt and instal the pavers i want to avoid digging this large tree stump out of the groundmarie says july 13th 2010 at 553 pmjust bought a house and had to replace a wall of cedar siding that had a flower bed right next to it the dirt was about 812 inches up the siding and it had rotted out now we’re removing the dirt and putting in a paver patio the addition is on top of a dirt crawl space so no area of cement foundation really if we leave a gap of 3 inches between the sided wall and the pavers and fill the gap with gravel should we anticipate a repeated issue with moisture tim bur says july 1st 2010 at 227 pm danny is way way wrong concrete pavers installed correctly are designed to last 100 years go to unilockcom and click on the install guide also be advised to actually be called a paver a concret product must be a minimum of 8000 psi you won’t find these at big box stores and lastly polymeric sand is the best weed deterrent don’t follow this thread you’ll be sorry buffy d says may 22nd 2010 at 941 pm we live in a dry area but during the winter we can get heavy rain rarely light snow our backyard is bare and covered with hard soil we are about to lay 16×16 concrete pavers we are trying to keep the cost down but we want to do it right and not have problems in the end our soil is grainy and hard is it a must that we lay gravel then sand before the pavers also my husband wants to avoid weeds and is considering laying a weed blocking cloth at what point should the weed blocking cloth be laid before gravel between gravel and sand when help elisha says may 17th 2010 at 645 am i was wondering if you can use sand mixed with quikrete for the joints rather than the polymeric sand if i do use the sandquikrete mixture will it eventually discolor what color is the polymeric sand thanksdustin says may 11th 2010 at 959 pm16×16 pavers – 250 sq ft patio should i put weed blocking cloth under the pavers and if so under the leveling sand or on top thanks sharon says may 10th 2010 at 837 amhey quick question my husbad and i are doing a 24 x24 i just wanted to know if you removed your staked after the job was finnished sharontj cannariato says may 7th 2010 at 943 ami recently had 18″ x 18″ concrete block pavers installed over a 700 square foot area when i bought the pavers they were grey in color after the installation it rained the next day when the pavers dried we noticed that some of the blocks had changed to a concrete color is this normal i called the company where the pavers were purchased and they sent a representative to look at the area he really could not give me a diffinative answer he said he would refer to his customer service dept and have them contact me ps i am noticing that the other blocks are stating to change in color do you think they will eventually all change to the concrete color kate from indiana says may 3rd 2010 at 1153 am hello – i also want to ask about laying concrete pavers over an existing square concrete slab what process do you recommend could you post a tutorial specifically for this some sites recommend mortar and others rarely answer this question here’s hoping that you can respond with a few suggestions we are novice diyers and are trying to add value to our home thanksben erickson says may 3rd 2010 at 902 am hi wanda way to go glad to hear your paver patio project went wellwanda gilmer says may 3rd 2010 at 841 am my daughter and i layed a 200 sf patio for her and if we can do it anyone can after measuring off the area then diging out about three inches we used a small tiller to break of the dirt and even it as much as we could next we spread rock powder leveling sand over the area and leveled it as much as we could after that we just sat down using small levels and basically leveled each area for each stone as we went we were using 12×12 cement blocks we gave it a slight slope from the house to drain the water well we finished it by using concrete grout to fill in the spaces between blocks by sweeping it over the pavers then watering it down it took a couple of times to fill all crates but it looks very good sheila says april 22nd 2010 at 518 am i am about to put in a patio using 16 x 16 pavers the area i will place it is grassey do i need to dig this up or can i just lay weed liner and sand the place the pavers using sand again as a filler i’m new at this and need all the help you guys can give please step by steplatinpaver says march 22nd 2010 at 304 pm i have 12 years installing pavers in my opinion the work of the video is badthis work soon need maintenance and repair is more difficult to make new again a good foundation will make it more durable and drop is one inch per ten feet scott says march 14th 2010 at 335 pm i understand the fundamentals of installing concrete pavers i have three questions 1 should some type of spacer be used between the pavers and foundation of the house here in the northeast most homes have basements and are not on a slab 2 should the foundation below the pavers be protected with foundation water proofing 3 is the 8″ from siding or water table board required and what is usually used as step material from a slider to the patio stone pavers or wooden steps jim lewis paver contractor portland oregon says january 3rd 2010 at 729 am i agree with avery you really should have the proper base for laying pavers geo fabric min 4″ compacted gravel and 1″ sand as a base then use polymeric sand in the joints avery says september 18th 2009 at 548 am you really should not lay pavers without a base you really need atleast 4″ of 34″ modified stone and that is for a loam soil not clay you will have settlement problems without a base for more accurate info check out the icpi website that would be the place to order a book on how to install properly ben erickson says september 9th 2009 at 910 am hi james you can install pavers without a gravel base in fact that’s how danny is doing it in the above video a gravel base can make it easier to position the pavers and aid in drainage if the ground doesn’t drain well james says september 8th 2009 at 121 pmis it possible to install pavers without using gravel but just using the dirt and adding concrete sand pam says july 29th 2009 at 131 pm we are laying concrete pavers out from our garage door we have two inches of rigid foundation insulation exterior to the garage floor up to the lip of the floor do we cut it out and lay the pavers over the insulation or have the pavers butt the insulation leaving two inches of insulation exposed between our garage floor and the pavers the whole purpose of the insulationpavers is to prevent frost heavemichelle says july 18th 2009 at 1109 amwe used quikrete fin sand white to fill the spaces between the pavers the sand is now discolored green black brown white etc i’d like to replace all sand with new sand what sand is best and how cna i ensure it won’t discolor  thanks ben erickson says august 4th 2009 at 1203 pm hi kings when laying a paver patio the pavers should butt up to each other with only a small gap for sand an inch would be way too much kings says july 16th 2009 at 329 pm i laid out a patio using 8×8 pavers is it ok to have an inch of space between the blocks and it fill that space with sand or is 1″ to much space between pavers joe weatherman says june 5th 2009 at 641 pmwhich do i use for base for 8×16 pavers  is it just sand or the gravel and sand combination my 20x22 back sits on clay please advise ben erickson says june 8th 2009 at 843 am hi joe there’s a debate over the best way to lay a paver patio with some advocating a bed of compacted gravel or stone dust topped by sand while others feel that sand alone is sufficient since clay doesn’t drain well i would opt for 2″4″ of compacted gravel topped by an inch of sand joe weatherman says june 5th 2009 at 639 pmcan you please help me on this i am putting down 8×16 paver in my backyard sit on top of clay do dig down 4 inches do i use just sand or the combo kit 1 gravel 2 sand one site that i visted said use sand only another site use the combo kit  who is right help adrian says december 21st 2008 at 912 pm i am wanting to put in patio pavers with fire pit… anyone know where i can get a design or instructions for this diy  thanks ray says december 3rd 2008 at 1115 am thanks for the details reports  photos over the years house to house helping out others and at work i’ve had jobs of all kinds that need a refresher not one of them are a way of life but more like one of a kind so once again thanks and keep up the very good work it helps more then you know k graham says november 11th 2008 at 259 pm would pouring cement as a base for patio pavers be better than sakcrete the patio pavers are 16×16 and designed to butt up to one another with no sand in between worried about pavers getting uneven after it rains installer thinks sakcrete will be as good as cement if fall is right for drainagejohn schultz says october 21st 2008 at 122 pm i want to heat a portion of my outdoor uncovered patio which is 3″ pavers set over 4″ concrete i think i want a electrical grid sandwiched between the pavers and the concrete and then “shave” the pavers to create the space for the grid i want to create a toasty warm adjustable temp area under my patio table in the winter one that will not only melt ice and snow but warm my feet plus survive outdoors in kansas i need a source for materials and experienced advise thanks jassen says september 22nd 2008 at 1132 pm how much is to much sand for a base i have been working on a 16’x 30′ patio for 2 years i have a almost no time to finish it anymore i have the rock base in and alot of sand down i called a guy to help me finish it he told me i have to much sand i have 4 inchs and less he wants to take sand out put 6 ton more rock in over the 15 tons i have in it then put 1″ of sand down he said any sand over 1″ and the pavers will wable he wants over 4 grand to do it most sites i have read said 1″ to 3′ of sand what do you think j j says september 21st 2008 at 1142 am i install 10’s of thousands of sf of pavers a year and how this guy is showing you is old old school patios aren’t done this way more brad says september 19th 2008 at 135 pm someone said “lay pavers and save all the trouble of pouring cement” that is funny pavers are way more work anyway… i highly recommend raising you paver patios out of the dirt this is what i do i border the entire project with 8x8x16 stacked blocks for every block above ground have two in the ground so there will be some digging the base for the blocks is crushed quartzite or manufactured sand after digging your trench for the blocks put the quartzite dust down and flood the trench with water this will settle and level the dust next stack your block so you have at least one block above grade if you measure correctly you won’t have to cut a block make sure your corners are joinedoverlapped next put a stick of 38 rebar in each cement block cell and fill with quickrete next cap this with whatever capstone you want using cement block adhesive to hold the capstone in place make sure it is for landscaping block and a quality product next dig out the remaining sod and as much dirt as is needed so you can add 4 inches of gravel and two inches of base material and your paver so they end up even with your capstone next fill level and compact four inches of gravel called 14″ minus or 516″ minus this is a type of gravel that has no round rocks they are all cracked and have at least four sides next fill level and compact your two or so inches of quartzite dustmanufactured sand it is pink in color screed this very carefully using the two pipes as explained in other places a quality screed will take alot of time but makes laying the pavers really easy next lay your pavers drop the paver into place and give each one a good rap with a rubber mallet there are more finer points to this but you will figure it out lay all your pavers then go around the edges and measure and cut all the other pavers next fill the joints of your pavers with a high quality polymeric fine sand only next seal the project with a quality sealer like from du pont this is expensive but easy to do this is not necessary but highly recommended next vernier your exposed 8x8x16 block with a tile or stone of your choice that is it it will last decades is an easy and time consuming process take your time and have fun with it bradken weisner says september 15th 2008 at 102 am we manufacture concrete pavers in various colors sizes and styles heavy commercial to patio or pooldeck overlays and retaining walls from central fl to virginia we also distribute pine hall clay products and can introduce you to certified installers in your area or facilitate a diy project httpwww lcpavercom mel says september 13th 2008 at 836 pm this is in response to doc um when danny says leveling sand he means to level the sand as in “make the sand flat” leveling sand is not a type of sandal black says september 5th 2008 at 639 pm my husband and i wanted to create a stone patio off our back door needless to say we really messed up it looks terrible how can we fix the area so that we can put down pavers next spring thanks for your suggestions avery hertzler says august 25th 2008 at 957 pm hire a contractor to do this job properly you will need a 2500 tamper a 1000 saw a dump truck and many other expensive tools do yourself a favor and hire a icpi certified contractor with a strong reputation that will get the job done right feel free to call 804 5120190deb says august 21st 2008 at 233 pm use the patio morter instead of sand it goes in just like sand and then is watered down we don’t get any weeds coming up through it at all tim says august 8th 2008 at 837 am pavers over concrete my friend had extensive concrete work done about 10 – 15 years ago new sidewalks patio of brick flooring driveway etc it still looks very good and no weeds between the brick patio i called the same contractor and instead of using sandgravel as a base for the pavers we selected he used concrete and installed it with a very smooth surface and slightly pitched for water runoff he than installed the pavers on it and used mortar on a sloped angle to the ground to hold all the borders in place rather than wood or some other material he said that the sandgravel base usually required is more for a diyer because the average person is not going to mix concrete and install it properly for a paver base he said that is how he installed my friend’s patio he said it will last as long as any other base if not longer and be less likely to have sink spots and weeds growing up from below he also said it is faster and less work using a concrete base it looks great and feels very solid i don’t know if it is the right thing to do but so far so good suzanne says august 1st 2008 at 807 am my parents put in a tumbled paver patio the pavers butt up against t111 wood siding that is painted how should he keep water from getting between the painted siding and the pavers he doesn’t want water trapped in between and rotting the siding any suggestionsjim says july 29th 2008 at 818 am i need help just put in a paver patio and the sand is being wash out and also being track in the house is there something i can do lp says july 28th 2008 at 849 am i have an old brick patio and it looks ugly now and is not leveled anymore i want to create new patio on top of this because it is more hassle to take the old

patio that has settled i just bought a house which has an inground pool surrounded by a paver patio insalled 1978 the pavers are all uneven thank you ginny roby rafael sanchez says july 18th 2008 at 1031 pm i will like to install pavers stones over a concrete pad how can i do it do i put sand under or just laid down over the concrete thanksdave p says june 27th 2008 at 1143 pm doc play sand and masonary sand are the same  if you want a better sand for pavers use polymeric sand this sand stays in place and weeds do not grow threw it it is also best to use a cr6 base under the pavers then sandif you can do not use wood as an edge in the winter when the ground freezes the wood will rais up they make better edging such as pavetech please trust me on this i have been instaling pavers for 18 years the way that danny shows you to instal the pavers is not correct please use icpi standerds if you instal the pavers in the corect way they will last for years if you dont they will only last for months before you have problems with watter or weeds doc v says june 26th 2008 at 134 pm i’m making a modest patio area with 12×12 pavers i have the area framed and leveled have the pavers but need the sand danny’s talked about leveling sand no one around here has any such thing it’s either play sand from the toy store or regular old sand from the riverside quarry does the type of sand make a big difference thanks for info doc joan says june 25th 2008 at 1048 am we live near the bay and are finally getting around to doing a patio instead of laying a traditional patio for a more tropical feeland a much cheaper cost we’re considering laying down sand out back through the slider with a border around the 9 x 12 area and throwing up a tiki hut would that work or just be a wash out thanks

at 126 pm i have the same problem with the weeds growing up between the pavers you may want to try to pull up the weeds spray weed killer in the opening of course you have the sand out and use the concrete that can be applied with a chaulking gun you can smooth that in it will look nice and no more weeds best of luck it’s a big jobbill schwab says september 5th 2007 at 222 am use polymeric sand on the joints or sealcoat with surebond 1100 applied librally with a foam roller after it sets up it will fill the sand and bond so it does not allow weeds to germinate sandy says may 6th 2007 at 709 am i have been trying to build my own patio for two years i put sand in between the concrete blocks and brick pavers but i still have weeds i have been removing the weed roots and filling it with
