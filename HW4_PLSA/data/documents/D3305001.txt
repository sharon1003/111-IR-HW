taking antibiotics it is important that your child completes the course of antibiotic this means that they must take the medicine for the number of days that the doctor has told you to or until all the medicine has been taken if you stop giving the antibiotic too soon the bacteria that are left will start to multiply again and may cause another infection there is also a risk that these bacteria will be ‘resistant’ to no longer be killed by the first antibiotic this means that it might not work next time and your child might need a different antibiotic children are sometimes sick vomit or get diarrhoea when taking antibiotics encourage them to drink water to replace the fluid they have lost if it is severe or your child is drowsy contact your doctor do not give your child any medicine to stop the diarrhoea unless your doctor has told you to as this can make things worse try to give the medicine at about the same times each day to help you remember and to make sure that there is the right amount of medicine in your child’s body to kill the bacteria only give this medicine to your child for their current infection never save medicine for future illnesses give old or unused
