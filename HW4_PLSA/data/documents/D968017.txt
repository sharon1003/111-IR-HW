worried continous nonstop period for over 5 weeks nowposted in sexual conditions 11 replies posted by anonymous june 10 2006 0756 pmim waiting for insurance to kick in so i cant see and havent seen a doctor yet anyhow this is the first time ive ever written to a forum because im starting to panic about my symptoms first of all i have had a menstrual period continuously every day nonstop since may 4 2006 and it is now june 10 2006 5 weeks second i have been getting severe dizzy spell about every 23 days during this time frame it basically feels like im tipsydrunk from alcohol the last drink i had was in december and the only conclusion i can think of is well lack of iron from losing so much blood therefore possibly anemia third ive been getting light flashesblobs in my right eye on the right side of the eye sortof like when you are really really tired and you rub your eyes kind of hard and you can see a blob from your finger rubbing the light i see is about the size of a finger print fourth ive started to bruise easy in the last week and a half again the only thing i can think of is lack of iron therefore anemia due to blood loss from long period and i have about 5 bruises right now fifth i just noticed a little skin rash right above my pubic hairline and below my belly button i cant think thats at all related but i dont know well theres the list some things that might help i am morbidly obese ive gained about 200lbs in a 4 year time frame i cant seem to lose the weight i was put on a 1000 calorie diet by a endochrinologist i was seeing it didnt work and yes i really did follow it im kind of tired of problems being blamed on the weight i kind of think the weight might be a symptom because im 23 i had an rotc scholarship worked out every day hardly ate anything and couldnt lose the 15 pounds i needed to then to meet my weight max age 1718 weight then was 185 so i had to give the scholarship up and started to eat normal and just steadily kept gaining weight i eat salad every day for a meal and sometimes have it twice a day and i have oatmeal for breakfast when i was seeing the endochrinologist i had missed some periods the longest i went without one was 35 months january 2005 i had xrays and ultrasounds done and they did not find pcos or fybroids so she had started doing other tests had frequent nosebleeds last summer she did an xray said i had a deviated septum and allergies she did an xray of my liver and i had an elarged fatty liver as though i were an alcoholic which i hardly every drink my cholesterol was normal and blood pressure is normal the only tests that came back abnormal was testosterone which was a little high and i had extremely high serotonin a 137 she said normal was like 68 and deppression numbers are like 34 whatever that means and thats as far as i got before i switched jobs and had to be on a probation period without medical benefits for 6 months so everything has been fine these few months except for what i listed as symptoms and that the 1000 calorie diet isnt working i would appreciate any feedback and help i can get on this and any information i can research to jump right back into testing to figure out whats wrong with me once my insurance is up and running again thank you sooooo muchreply follow this thread flag this discussion
