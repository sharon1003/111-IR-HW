muscle cramps facts a muscle cramp is an involuntarily and forcibly contracted muscle that does not relax muscle cramps can occur in any muscle cramps of the leg muscles and feet are particularly common almost everyone experiences a muscle cramp at some time in their life there are a variety of types and causes of muscle cramps muscle cramps may occur during exercise at rest or at night depending upon the exact cause dehydration is a common cause of muscle cramps numerous medicines can cause muscle cramps most muscle cramps can be stopped if the muscle can be stretched muscle cramps can often be prevented by measures such as adequate nutrition and hydration attention to safety when exercising and attention to ergonomic factors quick guide dehydration causes symptoms  tips to stay hydrated muscle cramps a real pain cramps can be perceived as mild twitches or may be excruciatingly painful typically cramps cause an abrupt intense pain in the involved muscle often a muscle that is cramping feels harder than normal to the touch or may even show visible signs of twitching read about treatment of muscle cramps »what are muscle cramps a muscle cramp is an involuntarily and forcibly contracted muscle that does not relax when we use the muscles that can be controlled voluntarily such as those of our arms and legs they alternately contract and relax as we move our limbs muscles that support our head neck and trunk contract similarly in a synchronized fashion to maintain our posture a muscle or even a few fibers of a muscle that involuntarily without consciously willing it contracts is in a spasm if the spasm is forceful and sustained it becomes a cramp muscle cramps often cause a visible or palpable hardening of the involved muscle muscle cramps can last anywhere from a few seconds to a quarter of an hour or occasionally longer it is not uncommon for a cramp to recur multiple times until it finally resolves the cramp may involve a part of a muscle the entire muscle or several muscles that usually act together such as those that flex adjacent fingers some cramps involve the simultaneous contraction of muscles that ordinarily move body parts in opposite directions muscle cramps are extremely common almost everyone one estimate is about 95 experiences a cramp at some time in their life muscle cramps are common in adults and become increasingly frequent with aging however children also experience cramps of muscles any of the muscles that are under our voluntary control skeletal muscles can cramp cramps of the extremities especially the legs and feet

better manage your migraine start now what are the types and causes of muscle cramps readers comments 95 share your story skeletal muscle cramps can be categorized into four major types these include true cramps tetany contractures and dystonic cramps cramps are categorized according to their different causes and the muscle groups they affect types of muscle cramps true cramps true cramps involve part or all of a single muscle or a group of muscles that generally act together such as the muscles that flex several adjacent fingers or the leg muscles most authorities agree that true cramps are caused by hyperexcitability of the nerves that stimulate the muscles they are overwhelmingly the most common type of skeletal muscle cramps true cramps can occur in a variety of circumstances as follows muscle cramps and spasms slideshow sports injuries pictures slideshow first aid sprains  strains slideshow pictures injury and vigorous activity muscle cramps injury persistent muscle spasm may occur as a protective mechanism following an injury such as a broken bone in this instance the spasm tends to minimize movement and stabilize the area of injury injury of the muscle alone may cause the muscle to spasm vigorous activity true cramps are commonly associated with the vigorous use of muscles and muscle fatigue in sports or with unaccustomed activities such cramps may come during the activity or later sometimes many hours later likewise muscle fatigue from sitting or lying for an extended period in an awkward position or any repetitive use can cause cramps older adults are at risk for cramps when performing vigorous or strenuous physical activities rest cramps and dehydration muscle cramps rest cramps cramps at rest are very common especially in older adults but may be experienced at any age including childhood rest muscle cramps often occur at night while not life threatening night cramps commonly known as nocturnal cramps can be painful disruptive of sleep and they can recur frequently that is many times a night andor many nights each week the actual cause of night cramps is unknown sometimes such cramps are initiated by making a movement that shortens the muscle an example is pointing the toe down while lying in bed which shortens the calf muscle of the leg a common site of muscle cramps dehydration sports and other vigorous activities including activities of endurance athletes can cause excessive fluid loss from perspiration this kind of dehydration increases the likelihood of true cramps these cramps are more likely to occur in warm weather and can be an early sign of heat stroke chronic volume depletion of body fluids from diuretics medicine that promote urination and poor fluid intake both lead to dehydration and may act similarly to predispose to cramps especially in older people sodium depletion has also been associated with cramps loss of sodium the most abundant chemical constituent of body fluids outside the cell is usually a

cramps also may be experienced in other conditions that feature an unusual distribution of body fluids an example is cirrhosis of the liver which leads to the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity  ascites  similarly cramps are a relatively frequent complication of the rapid body fluid changes that occur during dialysis for kidney failure low blood calcium or magnesium low blood levels of either calcium or magnesium directly increase the excitability of both the nerve endings and the muscles they stimulate this may be a predisposing factor for the spontaneous true cramps experienced by many older adults as well as for those muscle cramps that are commonly noted during pregnancy low levels of calcium and magnesium are common in pregnant women unless these minerals are supplemented in the diet cramps are seen in any circumstance that decreases the availability of calcium or magnesium in body fluids such as taking diuretics hyperventilation overbreathing excessive vomiting inadequate calcium andor magnesium in the diet inadequate calcium absorption due to vitamin d deficiency poor function of the parathyroid glands tiny glands in the neck that regulate calcium balance and other conditions low potassium low potassium blood levels occasionally cause muscle cramps although it is more common for low potassium to be associated with muscle weakness types of muscle cramps  tetany in tetany all of the nerve cells in the body are activated which then stimulate the muscles this reaction causes spasms or cramps throughout the body the name tetany is derived from the effect of the tetanus toxin on the nerves however the name is now commonly applied to muscle cramping from other conditions such as low blood levels of calcium and magnesium low calcium and low magnesium which increase the activity of nerve tissue nonspecifically also can produce tetanic cramps often such cramps are accompanied by evidence of hyperactivity of other nerve functions in addition to muscle stimulation for instance low blood calcium not only causes spasm of the muscles of the hands and wrists but it can also cause a sensation of numbness and tingling around the mouth and other areas sometimes tetanic cramps are indistinguishable from true cramps the accompanying changes of sensation or other nerve functions that occurs with tetany may not be apparent because the cramp pain

are stimulated to contract muscles that are affected by this type of cramping include those that ordinarily work in the opposite direction of the intended movement andor others that exaggerate the movement some dystonic cramps usually affect small groups of muscles eyelids jaws neck larynx etc the hands and arms may be affected during the performance of repetitive activities such as those associated with handwriting writers cramp typing playing certain musical instruments and many others each of these repetitive activities may also produce true cramps from muscle fatigue dystonic

can mimic a muscle cramp answer a contracture is a condition that may mimic a muscle cramp a contracture is a scarring of the soft tissues that muscle movements normally affect when a contracture is present the tissue that is involved cannot move completely whether the corresponding muscle is activated or relaxed this is because the scarred tissue cannot move in response to muscle movements this leads to a fixed body part with loss of full range of motion the most common type of contracture occurs in the palm of the hand and affects the tendons that normally cause the fingers to close with gripping most commonly this form of contracture affects the ring finger this contracture is known as a dupuytrens contracture of the hand quick guide dehydration causes symptoms  tips to stay hydrated

directly or indirectly lead to muscle cramps these include deficiencies of thiamine b1 pantothenic acid b5 and pyridoxine b6 the precise role of deficiency of these vitamins in causing cramps is unknown can poor circulation cause muscle cramps poor circulation to the leg muscles which results in inadequate oxygen to the muscle tissue can cause severe pain in the leg muscle sometimes known as claudication pain or intermittent claudication that occurs with walking or exercise this commonly occurs in the calf muscles while the pain feels virtually identical to that of a severely cramped muscle the pain does not seem to be a result of the actual muscle cramping this pain may be due to accumulation of lactic acid and other chemicals in the muscle tissues its important to see your

swelling which can occasionally persist up to several days after the cramp has subsided at the time of cramping the knotted muscle will bulge feel very firm and may be tender there are no special tests for cramps nevertheless the diagnosis of muscle cramps is relatively easy most people know what cramps are and when they have one if present during a cramp the doctor or any other bystander can

be stretched for many cramps of the feet and legs this stretching can often be accomplished by standing up and walking around for a calf muscle cramp the person can stand about 2 to 25 feet from a wall possibly farther for a tall person and lean into the wall to place the forearms against the wall with the knees and back straight and the heels in contact with the floor it is best to learn this maneuver at a time when you dont have the cramp another technique involves flexing the ankle by pulling the toes up toward the head while still lying in bed with the leg as straight as possible for writers cramp contractures in the hand pressing the hand on a wall with the fingers facing down will stretch the cramping finger flexor muscles gently massaging the muscle will often help it to relax as will applying warmth from a heating pad or hot soak if the cramp is associated with fluid loss as is often the case with vigorous physical activity fluid and electrolyte especially sodium and potassium replacement is essential medicines generally are not needed to treat an ordinary cramp that is active since most cramps subside spontaneously before enough medicine would be absorbed to even have an effect quick guide dehydration causes symptoms  tips to stay hydrated medical treatment for muscle cramps muscle relaxant medications may be used over the shortterm in certain situations to relax muscle cramps due to an injury or other temporary event these medications include cyclobenzaprine  flexeril  orphenadrine  norflex  and baclofen  lioresal  in recent years injections of therapeutic doses of botulism toxin  botox have been used successfully for some dystonic muscle disorders that are localized to a limited group of muscles a good response may last several months or more and the injection may then be repeated the treatment of cramps that are associated with specific medical conditions generally focuses on treating the underlying condition sometimes additional medications specifically for cramps are prescribed with certain of these conditions of course if cramps are severe frequent persistent respond poorly to simple treatments or are not associated with an obvious cause then the patient and the doctor need to consider the possibility that more intensive treatment is indicated or that the cramps are a manifestation of another disease as described above the possibilities are extremely varied and include problems with circulation nerves metabolism hormones medications and nutrition it is uncommon for muscle cramps to occur as the result of a medical condition without other obvious signs that the medical condition is present cramps are inevitable but if possible it would be best to prevent them muscle cramps and spasms slideshow sports injuries

excessive weight loss 2 of body weight you should weigh yourself before and after exercise to see how much fluid you lose through sweat one liter of water weighs 225 pounds depending on the amount of exercise temperature and humidity body weight and other factors you can lose anywhere from approximately 4 to 18 liters per hour preexercise hydration if needed05 liters per hour for a 180pound person several hours three to four hours prior to exercise consuming beverages with sodium andor small amounts of salted snacks or sodiumcontaining foods at meals will help to stimulate thirst and retain the consumed fluids during exercise suggested starting points for marathon runners are 04 to 08 liters per hour but again this should be individualized based on body weight loss there should be no more than 10 carbohydrate in the beverage and 7 has generally been considered close to optimal carbohydrate consumption is generally recommended only after one hour of exertion electrolyte repletion sodium and potassium can help sustain electrolyte balance during exercise particularly whenthere is inadequate access to meals or meals are not eatenphysical activity exceeds four hours in duration orduring the initial days of hot weather under these conditions adding modest amounts of salt 03 gl to 07 gl can offset salt loss in sweat and minimize medical events associated with electrolyte imbalances for example muscle cramps hyponatremia  postexercise drink approximately 05 liters of water for every pound of body weight lost consuming beverages and snacks with sodium will help expedite rapid and

during pregnancy supplemental calcium and magnesium have each been shown to help prevent cramps associated with pregnancy an adequate intake of both of these minerals during pregnancy is important for this and other reasons but supervision by a qualified health care professional is essential while experiencing dystonic cramps cramps that are induced by repetitive nonvigorous activities can sometimes be prevented or minimized by careful attention to ergonomic factors such as wrist supports avoiding high heels adjusting chair position activity breaks and using comfortable positions and equipment while performing the activity learning to avoid excessive tension while executing problem activities can help however cramps can remain very troublesome for activities that are difficult to

can rest cramps be prevented while experiencing rest cramps nocturnal cramps and other rest cramps can often be prevented by regular stretching exercises particularly if done before going to bed even the simple calfstretching maneuver described in the first paragraph of the section on treatment if held for 10 to 15 seconds and repeated two or three times just before going to bed can be a great help in preventing nocturnal leg cramps the maneuver can be repeated each time you get up to go to the bathroom during the night and also once or twice during the day if nocturnal leg cramps are severe and recurrent a foot board can be used to simulate walking even while recumbent and may prevent awkward positioning of the feet during sleep ask your doctor about this remedy another important aspect of prevention of night cramps is adequate calcium and magnesium blood levels may not be sensitive enough to accurately reflect what is happening at the tissue surfaces where the hyperexcitability of the nerve occurs calcium intake of at least 1 gram daily is reasonable and 15 grams may be appropriate particularly for women with or at risk for osteoporosis an extra dose of calcium at bedtime may help prevent cramps supplemental magnesium may be very beneficial for some particularly if the person has a magnesium deficiency however added magnesium can be very hazardous for people who have difficulty eliminating magnesium as happens with kidney insufficiency the vigorous use of diuretics usually increases magnesium loss and high levels of calcium intake and therefore of calcium excretion tend to increase magnesium excretion magnesium is present in many foods greens grains meat and fish bananas apricots nuts and soybeans and some laxatives and antacids but a supplemental dose of 50100 milligrams of magnesium daily may be appropriate splitting the dose and taking a portion several times during the day minimizes the tendency to diarrhea that magnesium can cause vitamin e has also been said to help minimize cramp occurrence scientific studies documenting this effect are lacking but anecdotal reports are common since vitamin e is thought to have other beneficial health effects and is not toxic in usual doses taking 400 units of vitamin e daily is approved recognizing that documentation on its effect on cramps is lacking quick guide dehydration causes symptoms  tips to stay hydrated are there particular concerns for older adults older adults should have periodic magnesium blood levels taken if they use supplemental magnesium even a mild and otherwise not apparent degree of kidney dysfunction which is often seen in this age group may lead to toxic levels of magnesium with modest doses recent studies have indicated that vitamin d a vitamin required for the normal absorption of calcium from food deficiency is common in some elderly individuals consequently vitamin d replacement is important for these people taking appropriate care to avoid excessive vitamin d levels as these are toxic an intake at least 400 units daily has been recommended in the past more recently experts have questioned whether this dose of vitamin d is sufficient especially for people with little or no sun exposure sunlight promotes the formation of vitamin d in the body however excessive doses of vitamin d are known to be toxic the upper limit of dosing for vitamin d supplementation has been recommended as 2000 iu daily your health care professional can help you decide how much vitamin d you should take taking your individual situation and medical history into account while the more potent diuretics are associated with an increased loss of calcium and magnesium hydrochlorothiazide  hydro diuril and others and related diuretics are associated with calcium and magnesium retention diuretics are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure if cramps or osteoporosis are also a problem the patient and doctor may consider using hydrochlorothiazide or another thiazide type of diuretic if otherwise feasible and appropriate diuretics also cause sodium depletion and most also cause potassium depletion many patients who use diuretics are also on sodiumrestricted diets careful attention to the effects of diuretics on sodium and potassium and replacement of these elements as needed is always appropriate even more so if cramps are a problem older adults often do not hydrate themselves adequately partly because the sense of thirst diminishes with age this situation is exaggerated in those who are treated with diuretics for some simply increasing fluid intake to the generally recommended six to eight glasses a day will improve the cramps however drinks with caffeine should not be counted since they act on the kidneys to increase fluid loss individuals who are on restricted fluid intake should consult their doctor on this issue and must not ignore their recommended fluid intake limits as for night cramps the exact cause is often difficult to determine the best prevention involves stretching regularly adequate fluid intake appropriate calcium and vitamin d intake supplemental vitamin e and possibly  with physician consultation  supplemental magnesium intake muscle cramps and spasms slideshow sports injuries pictures slideshow first aid sprains  strains slideshow pictures are there medications to prevent muscle cramps readers comments 23 share your story in recent times the only medication that has been widely used to prevent and sometimes also to treat cramps is quinine quinine has been used for years in the treatment of malaria quinine acts by decreasing the excitability of the muscles it has also been shown to be effective in many but not all scientific studies however quinine also causes birth defects and miscarriages as well as serious side effects it has also occasionally caused hypersensitivity reactions and a deficiency of platelets which are the blood components responsible for clotting either of these reactions can be fatal quinine is also associated with a cluster of symptoms called cinchonism  nausea vomiting headaches and deafness additionally vision and heart irregularities can occur consequently quinine tablets are not available in the united states quinine is available in grocery stores in tonic water the u s fda does not recommend or
