mouse functionality it might do  it is a step up from the mousepad on my type cover keyboard i find the lighttracking thats used isnt always accurate  can be very annoying at times on the top side that flat scrolling area doesnt always work as expected or im not quite doing the scrolling gesture in the right spot it doesnt work on glass i find i spend to much time thinking about the mouse instead of just using it  its fussy the soft touch material its coated with is a lintdust magnet  something that becomes apparent after the first day of use its a clever design i like the way it bends into shape  it looks great matches the aesthetics of the surface pro 2  but when it comes to mousing around it fails  at least for mebenjitek apr 15 2014 5twiggy ship member joined feb 28 2014messages

passersby the same as my surface itself i love its portability it snaps right to flat and back again in a flick and connects instantly the scroll pad works nicely the haptic feedback is great and the overall design is very comfortable to use i love this thing its great best of all unlike the standard model the surface edition doesnt take up any usb ports so i can free up my surface for other
