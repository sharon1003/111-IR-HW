interested parties about their places of work that they have a regular workday with the hours of 8 to 5 i am normally used to working 9 to 5 and that is considered fulltime as well to many of my colleagues and management in the us the fair labor standards act does not set a legal number of hours that divides fulltimeparttime work and it is left to the employer so in what cases would companies see 85 as being more acceptable than 95 to be regular in their words fulltime these jobs in question are both for filling the same role software engineer and are in the same geographic area they usually havent indicated if it is to keep up with a regional office from a different time zone is the number of hours required to work as fulltime largely an indicator of the companys local culturehours fulltime usashare improve this questionedited jun 30 14 at 2251o jones133k 2 37 69asked apr 1 13 at 2346chris c977 2 10 2311do you get a paid lunchbreak – enderland ♦ apr 1 13 at 234923there was a time when workers were given paid breakslunches thats a benefit that has been eroded over the years so the norm is now often 8 hours of work no paid breaks hence the 85 to make up for an hour lunch why software developers are expected to work set hours in the first place is a whole other crazy debate  – da apr 2 13 at 0226da i see no reason to restrict that to just developers

key is framing it as a worklife balance question rather than a how much do i have to work question one consideration is this a salaried or hourly position this is important to know i know software engineers are generally salaried for fte but thats not the rule are you more concerned about the longer hours or earlier start time for example my current manager generally does not care when i get intoleave work as long as im accomplishing my goals and attending the few meetings i have if this is a larger company they may have more strict policies just ask dont wait until youre hired to find out that its a death march style company if its a mediumlarger company you can also check glassdoorcom and find reviews about the worklife balance of the company bottom line the best way to determine the company culture with regards to hours is to ask you dont want to work for a company for 3 months and end up quitting because they expect you to work 10 hours a day thats upsetting for you and for

government work not in small privatelyheld companies not in large corporations most places you are expected to put in 8 work hours and lunch does not count and is not paid from the us department of labor  httpwwwdolgovdoltopicworkhoursbreakshtm  bona fide meal periods typically lasting at least 30 minutes serve a different purpose than coffee or snack breaks and thus are not work time and are not compensable as you can see from the chart in the link state laws vary on whether a lunch break is required and what length the break must be in some states the employee can waive his lunch break and in others he cannot httpwwwdolgovwhdstatemealhtm skipping lunch is often not permitted by hr as the purpose is to give you a mental break which makes you more productive and less of a safety hazard in the case of an equipment operator another reason why hr often doesnt permit the skipping of lunch is that many people say they are going to work those hours and skip lunch and many of them still take a lunch break which means that the ones that dont have to suffer with the resulting policy expecting people to put in the 8 hours a day they are being paid for does not mean this is a deathmarch company it just means they expect to get what they are paying for which is 40 hours a week minimum for salaried workers project plans are based on you working this number of hours salaries are based on you working this number of hours why should a company pay you a 40hour salary if you only give them in the case of 95 35 hours ive seen plenty of jobs where that number of hours would be enough to make you parttime and lose your benefitsshare improve this answeredited jan 14 14 at 1401answered apr 2 13 at 1718hlgem127k 24 214 47517as a salaried worker it is more important that i am able to complete my tasks than whether or not i work 40 hours a week some weeks i can get my work done in 30 hours other weeks it takes 50 hours the whole point of the salary is to normalize these differences – zzzz bov apr 2 13 at 22164when i worked at a company that woudnt let me skip lunch i just took my lunch at the very end of the work day  – amy blankenship apr 3 13 at 1093zzzz bov you are wrong if you can finish your assigned work in 30 hours then you should be assigned more the point of salaried vice nonsalaried is to get out of paying you overtime you are still expected to put in 40 hours of work – hlgem apr 3 13 at 13319hlgem  that kind of attitude will result in employees that put in exactly 40 hours of work per week every week – james adam apr 3 13 at 15054hlgem  all depends on what the company is actually looking for getting the work done happy efficient employees and if the work by itself is keen to being productive there is no simple answer a pharmacist would absolutely need to be on time when opening the business and when leaving a software developer may not have those contraints and be more needed for his creativity and efficiency that eventually falls down to having an allbrain or a allpresence work dont forget that a programmer can also think about that code he is writing when walking outside and that alone is work – skippy fastol apr 22 13 at

in corporate america in positions that range from 1st level to c level employee training classes on this subject conducted by hr depts in those companies this is my advice hourly or salary hourly if you are hired to work a 40 hour week and your company establishes a 9 5 or an 85 thats what they expect from you and when you accept to work for them that what you agree to if you do not take the lunch break you can be directed to do so if you choose not to you are in defiance of a company directive and subject to discipline and possibly termination you are breaking your contract salary if the company wants you to work as an exempt ie exempt from overtime pay you may choose to take the job or not your decision if the job requires acceptance of variable schedules fluctuating hours or certain additional or higher level responsibilities and risk management it may well be deemed a salaried job generally salaried jobs have more flexibility but require more commitment from the employee fixed income is a benefit to some and is considered to even out the time worked over a year example recreational activity may require a dock manager to work 50  60 hours a week in the summer but be offset by weather days that may be days off in the winter salaried folks are either committed to the job and work as many hours as required or they prefer the salary as a form of guaranteed fixed pay and know they are required to work more than 40 hours if an employee requests a conversion from hourly to salary it could be to gain a benefit of working fewer hours by having more hours or days off from work effectively earning more and working less the management issue is to determine if the job meets the litmus test of value work vs pay risk management client service and necessary availability or it should remain an hourly job and be managed to obtain the results and the work hours agreed to if the job does not require the use of judgment or work under variable hours and conditions or if the employee is not required to work a minimum of 40 hours perhaps as much as 50  60 hours some weeks then it should be hourly if the job description for the position defines duties that require work of more than 40 hours of work it should be defined as salaried and the employee can accept or refuse the job my last opinion point is this in either case the manager is responsible to the company to get a fair days work for a fair days pay whether calculated on a daily weekly monthly or annual basis the employees responsibility is to deliver what has been agreed to in a salaried position it is more of a deliverable such as a service a project an objective or a goal in an hourly position it is the work and the time as projectedshare improve this answeranswered dec 6 15 at 2344user4473031 1comment from rejected edit making the job salaried because it requires more than 40 hours of work per week will get you in trouble with the department of labor big time first you need to determine whether the job meets the requirements for exemption executive administrative professsional or computer exemption in many cases even jobs that require over 40 hours will not qualify to be exempt and must be paid premium overtime for all hours worked over 40 – david k dec 15 16 at 1418add a comment not the answer youre looking for browse other questions tagged hours fulltime usa or ask your own questionasked5
