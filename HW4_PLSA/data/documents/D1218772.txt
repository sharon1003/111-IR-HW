development of princeton and community mc kinney weekly democrat gazette march 14 1901 tuesday a democrat reporter accompanied s h cole on a land surveying tour two miles southeast of princeton where mr cole ran a line for ben wilson of altoga who had sold his farm to g w duncan formerly of altoga while messrs cole wilson and duncan were surveying the reporter did the nimrod act resulting in our killing much time and ammunition mr duncan has a big job before him to clear up and put into cultivation his new bought land but we predict that he will be successful for appearances are that he possesses that pluck energy and ability so characteristic of tennesseans on our way home we tarried a brief time in the fast growing railroad village of princeton the prince of three s towns among the business enterprises we noted the following w a harrelson general merchandise alma wilson general merchandise and postmaster john k wilson druggist sam smith general merchandise and lunch stand meroncy  stinson general merchandise d c eifird general merchandise and bois darc dealer boorman  davis m ds  jack aycock bois darc dealer r l lafevers depot agent a m butler is having a large storeroom built which will be occupied in the near future by west bros late of tennessee who will place a large stock of general merchandise therein it is reported that alma wilson will in the near future erect a brick building we believe messrs alma wilson and w a harrelson are the pioneer merchants of princeton messrs meroncy and stinson have just recently embarked in the mercantile business both formerly lived near chambersville this county and are excellent gentlemen princeton is surrounded by a deep rich black soil formerly densely covered with timber green briars red bud and other sprouts but this condition has vanished before the ax saw grubbing hoe and plow wielded by an honest sturdy home loving yeomanry and as a happy result blocks of little farms lie in every direction from princeton even within the memory of the writer there was no princeton nor many settlements surrounding fifteen and twenty years ago we helped geo a and t b wilson survey along the course of tickey creek from almost its source to its mouth sometimes spending a whole day in the dense brush without food nor water carrying a chain then slumbering on blankets while the festive mosquitoes and ticks exultingly caressed us how different now a man can get a cool refreshing drink at almost every turn and feast on fat chicken spareribs and delicious biscuits instead of dry cornbread and strong northern bacon may the car of progress roll onward throughout the 20th century and princeton be a prince indeed among its kind a striking feature in the country are the number of new farm residences and barns just being erected while referring to these many improvements we will not forget to mention our visit to the office of drs boorman  davis these gentlemen while not officing in a brick edifice certainly have a well equipped office in fact as far as we were able to judge they are prepared to handle their patients just as well as many physicians of larger pretensions in larger towns we may possibly tire our reader with this writeup of princeton but being a pioneer of that section we feel rather an inspiration and now in conclusion for fear some of our newly acquired readers may doubt our claim as a pioneer we respectfully refer them to our old time friend john martin of jack county for whom we drove a span of mules while building ground tanks in princeton and culleoka
