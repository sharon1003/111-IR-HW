ghoris invasions of india are always of great significance in the medieval history of india as already mentioned his invasions laid the foundation of the muslim rule in india these muslim conquests of india led to the end of the multistate system in india the invasions of india by the muslims led to the beginning of the centralised political administration under the monarch which was the political ideal of the muhammad ghori during the invasions of india trade received a new impetus india got connected to the outer asiatic world after the ghoris invasions for the first time the invasions proved the weaknesses and incapabilities of the hindu rulers in protecting their territories from foreign conquests ghoris invasions led to the growth of a new dynasty known as the slave dynasty the invasions also led to spread of communalism and antireligious feelings towards the nonmuslim religions wbrsp191214ebakb201214last updated on  december 22 2014follow us on
