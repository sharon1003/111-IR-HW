azure azure subscription and service limits quotas and constraints march 29 2018 59 minutes to read contributorsall in this article limits and the azure resource manager servicespecific limits see also this document lists some of the most common microsoft azure limits which are also sometimes called quotas this document doesnt currently cover all azure services over time the list will be expanded and updated to cover more of the platform please visit azure pricing overview to learn more about azure pricing there you can estimate your costs using the pricing calculator or by visiting the pricing details page for a service for example windows vms  for tips to help manage your costs see prevent unexpected costs with azure billing and cost management note if you want to raise the limit or quota above the default limit open an online customer support request at no charge the limits cant be raised above the maximum limit value shown in the following tables if there is no maximum limit column then the resource doesnt have adjustable limits free trial subscriptions are not eligible for limit or quota increases if you have a free trial subscription you can upgrade to a payasyougo subscription for more information see upgrade azure free trial to payasyougo and free trial subscription faq limits and the azure resource manager it is now possible to combine multiple azure resources in to a single azure resource group when using resource groups limits that once were global become managed at a regional level with the azure resource manager for more information about azure resource groups see azure resource manager overview in the limits below a new table has been added to reflect any differences in limits when using the azure resource manager for example there is a subscription limits table and a subscription limits  azure resource manager table when a limit applies to both scenarios it is only shown in the first table unless otherwise indicated limits are global across all regions note it is important to emphasize that quotas for resources in azure resource groups are perregion accessible by your subscription and are not persubscription as the service management quotas are lets use v cpu quotas as an example if you need to request a quota increase with support for v cpus you need to decide how many v cpus you want to use in which regions and then make a specific request for azure resource group v cpu quotas for the amounts and regions that you want therefore if you need to use 30 v cpus in west europe to run your application there you should specifically request 30 v cpus in west europe but you will not have a v cpu quota increase in any other region  only west europe will have the 30v cpu quota as a result you may find it useful to consider deciding what your azure resource group quotas need to be for your workload in any one region and request that amount in each region into which you are considering deployment see

is 10000 or less however you can still find a resource by tag when the number exceeds 100004 these features are no longer required with azure resource groups and the azure resource manager note it is important to emphasize that virtual machine cores have a regional total limit as well as a regional per size series dv2 f etc limit that are separately enforced for example consider a subscription with a us east total vm core limit of 30 an a series core limit of 30 and a d series core limit of 30 this subscription would be allowed to deploy 30 a1 vms or 30 d1 vms or a combination of the two

describes scalability and performance targets for a vms data disks use these targets to help decide the number and type of disk that you need to meet your performance and capacity requirements important for optimal performance limit the number of highly utilized disks attached to the virtual machine to avoid possible throttling if all attached disks are not highly utilized at the same time then the virtual machine can support a larger number of disks for azure managed disks the disk limit for managed disks is per region and per disk type the maximum limit and also the default limit is 10000 managed disks per region and per disk type for a subscription for example you can create up to 10000 standard managed disks and also 10000 premium managed disks in a region per subscription managed snapshots and images count against the managed disks limit for standard storage accounts a standard storage account has a maximum total request rate of 20000 iops the total iops across all of your virtual machine disks in a standard storage account should not exceed this limit you can roughly calculate the number of highly utilized disks supported by a single standard storage account based on the request rate limit for example for a basic tier vm the maximum number of highly utilized disks is about 66 20000300 iops per disk and for a standard tier vm it is about 40 20000500 iops per disk for premium storage accounts a premium storage account has a maximum total throughput rate of 50 gbps the total throughput across all of your vm disks should not exceed this limit see virtual
