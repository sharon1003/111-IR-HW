planned for release in 2013 3 4 but was finalized as the third part of the trilogy which was released in december 2014 in the desolation of smaug on their journey to the lonely mountain the hobbit bilbo baggins and the thirteen dwarves he has just freed from webs battle giant spiders in the black forest of mirkwood they are saved but also taken prisoner by the wood elves led by legolas and tauriel for trespassing on their lands tauriel in particular saves kíli by killing two spiders that were attacking him it is later mentioned that tauriel is a talented warrior and was therefore made leader of the mirkwood border guards legolas the son of mirkwoods elven king thranduil is indicated to be attracted to her but as she is a lowly silvan elf she does not believe herself worthy of him thranduil in fact makes it clear that he does not consider her to be a suitable match for his son and warns her not to give legolas false hope during the dwarves imprisonment tauriel forms a romantic bond with kili when the dwarves escape with bilbo s help the pursuing elves are attacked by orcs during which tauriel again uses her fighting skills to save kili though kili is struck in the leg with an orcs arrow which tauriel later learns from a captured orc is a morgulcursed weapon that will slowly kill him just before thranduil seals off his kingdom upon learning that an evil entity has returned and is amassing great power in the south tauriel goes after the dwarves legolas follows and initially tries to convince her to return but when tauriel refuses saying that the elves are part of middle earth and will be drawn into this inevitable war legolas joins her pursuit after acquiring provisions at esgaroth the dwarves leave for the lonely mountain kili fili and óin remain behind due to kilis injury as does bofur who overslept by the time tauriel and legolas reach esgaroth the dwarves are being attacked by orcs they repel the invaders and tauriel uses her knowledge of herbs and elvish medicine to heal kilis wound saving his life again in the hobbit the battle of the five armies during smaug s attack on esgaroth tauriel and these four dwarves facilitate the evacuation of bards family though bain soon leaves their company to aid his father against the dragon the following morning as the dwarves set out for erebor to rejoin their company kili asks tauriel to come with them but legolas arrives and reminds her of other duties so they reluctantly are forced to part when a messenger from thranduil arrives to announce her banishment from the mirkwood realm for going against his orders she joins legolas in investigating the old fortress gundabad where they witness the departure of an army led by bolg to join the forces of his father azog marching against erebor hurrying towards the mountain the two elves arrive in the thick of the battle of the five armies when tauriel witnesses thranduil attempting to leave the battlefield with the intent of sparing his people further bloodshed she confronts him with her bow and a nocked arrow refusing to abandon kili to death thranduil dismissing the depth of her feelings for kili destroys her bow though he spares her life despite her defiance learning that kili had joined thorins pursuit of azog she and legolas hurry to azogs command post the ravenhill to aid the dwarves running to find kili tauriel is intercepted and brought to her knees by bolg before the orc can strike the fatal blow however kili intervenes on her behalf and bolg kills him instead in retaliation tauriel tackles bolg throwing him and herself off a ruined platform onto the rocks beneath thus leading to bolgs final battle with legolas who kills bolg following the resolution of the battle thranduil finds tauriel weeping over kilis body finally acknowledging that her feelings for the young dwarf were genuine conception and casting  editin 1937 j r r tolkien published the fantasy novel the hobbit whose plot centres on a group consisting of the titular bilbo baggins gandalf the wizard and thirteen dwarves who go in search of a treasure guarded by the dragon smaug during the course of their travels they enter the black forest of mirkwood where they find themselves in the dungeons of the silvan elves during the climactic battle of five armies at the end of the story the dwarves men and elves band together to fight an army of goblins and wargs 5although the character tauriel does not appear in this story she was created to be the head of the elven guard by peter jackson and his writing partners philippa boyens and fran walsh 1 3 who is also jacksons wife and producing partner in order to expand the world of the elves of mirkwood forest and to bring another woman to the cast which is otherwise dominated by men 1 6 the character tauriel is a silvan elf which means she is of a much lower order than the elves that had previously been seen in the lord of the rings film series and holds a lower social status than characters like arwen galadriel elrond and legolas 1 a woodland elf her name has been translated as forest daughter 7 8 9in june 2011 peter jackson announced that actress evangeline lilly who was known for her portrayal of kate austen in the abc television drama lost was cast in the role 10 lilly who had been a fan of tolkiens books since she was 13 11 expressed some trepidation at the reaction of tolkien purists to a character that does not appear in tolkiens written works but stated that creating the character for the adaptation was justified i believe she is authentic because tolkien refers to the woodland elves he just doesnt talk about who they are specifically… peter and fran know that world so well they’re not going to create a character that is not true to tolkiens world 7 nonetheless following the june 12 2013 release of the first trailer for the film some fans expressed dissatisfaction with the creation of a character that did not originate in the source material 12 13as head of the elven guard lilly says of tauriel shes slightly reckless and totally ruthless and doesnt hesitate to kill lilly also describes tauriel as a nonconformist 1 explaining that as a result of her relative youth among elves she is brash and impulsive 14 tending to rebel against the established social order of the elves 1 lilly explains shes only 600 years old shes just a baby so shes a bit more impulsive and shes a bit more immature i think shes more easily romanticized by a lot of things 14 alluding to tauriels pursuit of the dwarves in the desolation of smaug after thranduil closes his kingdoms borders and forbids any interference on the part of elves in outside affairs and her refusal to fight alongside him in the battle of the five armies lilly explains in a very out of character move for an elf shes broken ranks and disobeyed authority thats driven from her own conviction about what is right and what is wrong she feels so much at odds with thranduil that she feels the need to defy him i think that any defiant role that boxes authority is an easy fit for me because in life im a little bit like that 15 however tauriel also has a softer side and her character arc includes a love story though she and legolas first met as children and their relationship is significant 1 her romantic arc is not with him 7 10 as she develops a mutual attraction to the dwarf kili legolas father the elven king thranduil is fond of tauriel and sees something very special in her 1 though she understands that thranduil would not approve of her pairing with his son which thranduil confirms in the desolation of smaug when he tells her not to give legolas false hope of such a relationship lilly accepted the role under the condition that her role in the hobbit would not include a love triangle when she was called back into production for reshoots following the decision to split the story into three films instead of two she was told that such a plot device would indeed be added to the story 16 17filming of tauriels scenes began in september 2011 in new zealand 7 and was expected to last a year 11 lilly stated that she enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the set and the familiar experience of filming with a maledominated cast which was reminiscent of her work on lost and the hurt locker 18 lilly employed a language coach in order to effect the elvish language 7 14in addition to the red wig she wore to effect tauriels kneelength red hair lilly when given a choice of wearing small medium or large prosthetic ears chose the large ones which are three times the size of the prosthetics orlando bloom wore as legolas though lilly believed that the length of her hair would distract attention from the ears in terms of costuming unlike previous female elves who were noblewomen that wore complex formal gowns tauriel is a border guard and soldier and therefore wears more pragmatic elven military garb 6 14 the character is proficient in a variety of weapons but mainly wields a bow and two daggers 3 14 weapons that are also used by the character legolas who also appears with her in the hobbit films lilly employed a stunt coach for action scenes 7 she noted that the experience of having had her first child in may 2011 made aspects of filming the fighting scenes more strenuous than expected commenting recovering from labor is like recovering from a fullbody injury and i didnt realize to what extent that was true until i started training for elf fighting my hips dont move like they used to move my back doesnt move like it used to move my shoulders are sore every day but its fun 18 although lilly requested to do the characters wirework herself on account of her experience doing her own stunts on lost that work was performed by lillys stunt double 14 australian stuntwoman ingrid kleinig 19merchandising  edittauriel is part of lego set no 79001 titled escape from mirkwood spiders together with minifigures of legolas and the dwarves

a sort of pointyeared lara croft 26shaun gunner chairman of the tolkien society praised the inclusion of tauriel as the biggest gem and missed opportunity of this film stating that she provides a strong and warm voice in the story but that the writers were wrong to cheapen the character by putting her in a lovetriangle 27 fan reaction to tauriels appearance in the hobbit films and to other changes made by jackson in adapting tolkiens book for the screen were parodied in the song and video  who the ell is tauriel  by the esgaroth three 28 29in mad magazines parody of the desolation of
