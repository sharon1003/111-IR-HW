voltaren gel is fdaapproved for treating osteoarthritis pain in joints amenable to topical treatment such as knees hands wrists feet and elbows it has not been studied for use on hips spine or shoulders because the risk of side effects is lower with the topical route than with the oral one people may be tempted to put voltaren gel on any place they have pain sternfeld advised against this

or hand and four grams for each knee ankle or foot voltaren gel is typically applied four times a day total usage should not exceed 32 grams per day for all affected joints patients should wash their hands after application of voltaren gel unless the drug is used on the hands in which case patients should wait one hour before washing their hands all patients should not shower or bathe for at least one hour after drug application voltaren gel may not be as effective in the short term because it is slower acting than the oral route or other forms of diclofenac and nsaids said sternfeld voltaren oral voltaren oral should be taken with water and can be taken with food milk or an antacid if patients experience stomach pain taking it with anything but water may slow absorption and delay pain relief however it is important that patients do not lie down or crush chew or break the tablets this can increase side effects voltaren oral can be taken on an asneeded basis or on a regular schedule which is the more common approach to arthritis treatment if taking it on an as needed basis patients should use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible length of time in order to minimize
