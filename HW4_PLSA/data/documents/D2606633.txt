from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from hsl color spacenavigation search hsl  hue saturation lightness and hsv  hue saturation value are two alternative representations of the rgb color model designed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers to more closely align with the way human vision perceives colormaking attributes in these models colors of each hue are arranged in a radial slice around a central axis of neutral colors which ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top the hsv representation models the way paints of different colors mix together with the saturation dimension resembling various shades of brightly colored paint and the value dimension resembling the mixture of those paints with varying amounts of black or white paint the hsl model attempts to resemble more perceptual color models such as ncs or munsell placing fully saturated colors around a circle at a lightness value of 12 where a lightness value of 0 or 1 is fully black or

bibliography12 external links basic principle  editfig 2a hsl cylinder fig 2b hsv cylinder hsl and hsv are both cylindrical geometries  fig 2  with hue their angular dimension starting at the redprimary at 0° passing through the green primary at 120° and the blue primary at 240° and then wrapping back to red at 360° in each geometry the central vertical axis comprises the neutral achromatic or gray colors ranging from black at lightness 0 or value 0 the bottom to white at lightness 1 or value 1 the top in both geometries the additive primary and secondary colors —red yellow green cyan blue and magenta —and linear mixtures between adjacent pairs of them sometimes called pure colors are arranged around the outside edge of the cylinder with saturation 1 these saturated colors have lightness ½ in hsl while in hsv they have value 1 mixing these pure colors with black—producing socalled shades —leaves saturation unchanged in hsl saturation is also unchanged by tinting with white and only mixtures with both black and white—called tones —have saturation less than 1 in hsv tinting alone reduces saturation fig 3a–b if we plot hue and a hsl lightness or b hsv value against chroma rather than saturation the resulting solid is a bicone or cone respectively not a cylinder such diagrams often claim to represent hsl or hsv directly with the chroma dimension deceptively labeled saturation because these definitions of saturation—in which very dark in both models or very light in hsl nearneutral colors are considered fully saturated for instance from the bottom right in the sliced hsl cylinder or from the top right—conflict with the intuitive notion of color purity often a conic or biconic solid is drawn instead  fig 3  with what this article calls chroma as its radial dimension instead of saturation confusingly such diagrams usually label this radial dimension saturation blurring or erasing the distinction between saturation and chroma a as described below computing chroma is a helpful step in the derivation of each model because such an intermediate model—with dimensions hue chroma and hsv value or hsl lightness—takes the shape of a cone or bicone hsv is often called the hexcone model while hsl is often called the bihexcone model  fig 8  bmotivation  editthe hsl color space was invented in 1938 by georges valensi as a method to add color encoding to existing monochrome ie only containing the l signal broadcasts allowing existing receivers to receive new color broadcasts in black and white without modification as the luminance black and white signal is broadcast unmodified it has been used in all major analog broadcast television encoding including ntsc pal and secam and all major digital broadcast systems and is the basis for composite video 1 2fig 4 painters long mixed colors by combining relatively bright pigments with black and white mixtures with white are called tints mixtures with black are called shades and mixtures with both are called tones see tints and shades 3fig 5 this 1916 color model by german chemist wilhelm ostwald exemplifies the mixtures with white and black approach organizing 24 pure colors into a hue circle and colors of each hue into a triangle the model thus takes the shape of a bicone 4 5fig 6a the rgb gamut can be arranged in a cube fig 6b the same image with a portion removed for clarity fig 7 tektronix graphics terminals used the earliest commercial implementation of hsl in 1979 this diagram from a patent filed in 1983 shows the bicone geometry underlying the model 6see also color theory rgb color model and rgb color space most televisions computer displays and projectors produce colors by combining red green and blue light in varying intensities—the socalled rgb additiveprimary colors the resulting mixtures in rgb color space can reproduce a wide variety of colors called a gamut  however the relationship between the constituent amounts of red green and blue light and the resulting color is unintuitive especially for inexperienced users and for users familiar with subtractive color mixing of paints or traditional artists’ models based on tints and shades  fig 4  furthermore neither additive nor subtractive color models define color relationships the same way the human eye does cfor example imagine we have an rgb display whose color is controlled by three sliders ranging from 0–255 one controlling the intensity of each of the red green and blue primaries if we begin with a relatively colorful orange with s rgb values r  217 g  118 b  33 and want to reduce its colorfulness by half to a less saturated orange we would need to drag the sliders to decrease r by 31 increase g by 24 and increase b by 59 as pictured below in an attempt to accommodate more traditional and intuitive color mixing models computer graphics pioneers at parc and nyit developed the hsv model in the mid1970s formally described by alvy ray smith in the august 1978 issue of computer graphics in the same issue joblove and greenberg described the hsl model—whose dimensions they labeled hue relative chroma and intensity —and compared it to hsv  fig 1  their model was based more upon how colors are organized and conceptualized in human vision in terms of other colormaking attributes such as hue lightness and chroma as well as upon traditional color mixing methods—eg in painting—that involve mixing brightly colored pigments with black or white to achieve lighter darker or less colorful colors the following year 1979 at siggraph tektronix introduced graphics terminals using hsl for color designation and the computer graphics standards committee recommended it in their annual status report  fig 7  these models were useful not only because they were more intuitive than raw rgb values but also because the conversions to and from rgb were extremely fast to compute they could run in real time on the hardware of the 1970s consequently these models and similar ones have become ubiquitous throughout image editing and graphics software since then some of their uses are described below 10 11 12 13 14 15formal derivation  editfig 8 the geometric derivation of the cylindrical hsl and hsv representations of an rgb colorcube colormaking attributes  editsee also color vision the dimensions of the hsl and hsv geometries—simple transformations of the notperceptuallybased rgb model—are not directly related to the photometric colormaking attributes of the same names as defined by scientists such as the cie or astm nonetheless it is worth reviewing those definitions before leaping into the derivation of our models d for the definitions of colormaking attributes which follow see 16 17 18 19 20 21hue the attribute of a visual sensation according to which an area appears to be similar to one of the perceived colors red yellow green and blue or to a combination of two of them 16radiance  l eωthe radiant power of light

attribute of a visual sensation according to which the perceived color of an area appears to be more or less chromatic 16chroma the colorfulness relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white 16saturation the colorfulness of a stimulus relative to its own brightness 16brightness and colorfulness are absolute measures which usually describe the spectral distribution of light entering the eye while lightness and chroma are measured relative to some white point and are thus often used for descriptions of surface colors remaining roughly constant even as brightness and colorfulness change with different illumination saturation can be defined as either the ratio of colorfulness to brightness or that of chroma to lightness general approach  edithsl hsv and related models can be derived via geometric strategies or can be thought of as specific instances of a generalized lhs model the hsl and hsv modelbuilders took an rgb cube—with constituent amounts of red green and blue light in a color denoted r g b ∈ 0 1 e —and tilted it on its corner so that black rested at the origin with white directly above it along the vertical axis then measured the hue of the colors in the cube by their angle around that axis starting with red at 0° then they came up with a characterization of brightnessvaluelightness and defined saturation to range from 0 along the axis to 1 at the most colorful point for each pair of other parameters 3 11 12hue and chroma  editsee also hue and chrominance fig 9 both hue and chroma are defined based on the projection of the rgb cube onto a hexagon in the chromaticity plane chroma is the relative size of the hexagon passing through a point and hue is how far around that hexagon’s edge the point lies in each of our models we calculate both hue and what this article will call chroma after joblove and greenberg 1978 in the same way—that is the hue of a color has the same numerical values in all of these models as does its chroma if we take our tilted rgb cube and project it onto the chromaticity plane  perpendicular to the neutral axis our projection takes the shape of a hexagon with red yellow green cyan blue and magenta at its corners  fig 9  hue is roughly the angle of the vector to a point in the projection with red at 0° while chroma is roughly the distance of the point from the origin f gmore precisely both hue and chroma in this model are defined with respect to the hexagonal shape of the projection the chroma is the proportion of the distance from the origin to the edge of the hexagon in the lower part of the adjacent diagram this is the ratio of lengths op  op ′ or alternately the ratio of the radii of the two hexagons this ratio is the difference between the largest and smallest values among r g or b in a color to make our definitions easier to write we’ll define these maximum minimum and chroma component values as m m and c respectively hm max r g bm min r g bc m m to understand why chroma can be written as m − m notice that any neutral color with r  g  b projects onto the origin and so has 0 chroma thus if we add or subtract the same amount from all three of r g and b we move vertically within our tilted cube and do not change the projection therefore any two colors  r g b and  r − m g − m b − m project on the same point and have the same chroma the chroma of a color with one of its components equal to zero  m  0 is simply the maximum of the other two components this chroma is m in the particular case of a color with a zero component and m − m in general the hue is the proportion of the distance around the edge of the hexagon which passes through the projected point originally measured on the range 0 1 but now typically measured in degrees 0° 360° for points which project onto the origin in the chromaticity plane ie grays hue is undefined mathematically this definition of hue is written piecewise i  c 0m r2 m g4 m bhsometimes neutral colors ie with c  0 are assigned a hue of 0° for convenience of representation fig 10 the definitions of hue and chroma in hsl and hsv have the effect of warping hexagons into circles these definitions amount to a geometric warping of hexagons into circles each side of the hexagon is mapped linearly onto a 60° arc of the circle  fig 10  after such a transformation hue is precisely the angle around the origin and chroma the distance from the origin the angle and magnitude of the vector pointing to a color fig 11 constructing rectangular chromaticity coordinates α and β and then transforming those into hue h 2 and chroma c 2 yields slightly different values than computing hexagonal hue h and chroma c compare the numbers in this diagram to those earlier in this section sometimes for image analysis applications this hexagontocircle transformation is skipped and hue and chroma we’ll denote these h 2 and c 2 are defined by the usual cartesiantopolar coordinate transformations  fig 11  the easiest way to derive those is via a pair of cartesian chromaticity coordinates which we’ll call α and β 22 23 24αβatan2 β α the atan2 function a twoargument arctangent computes the angle from a cartesian coordinate pair notice that these two definitions of hue  h and h 2 nearly coincide with a maximum difference between them for any color of about 112°—which occurs at twelve particular hues for instance h  1338° h 2 1226° —and with h  h 2 for every multiple of 30° the two definitions of chroma  c and c 2 differ more substantially they are equal at the corners of our hexagon but at points halfway between two corners such as h  h 2 30° we have c  1 but c 2 √ ¾ ≈ 0866 a difference of about 134 lightness  editfig 12a–d four different possible lightness dimensions plotted against chroma for a pair of complementary hues each plot is a vertical crosssection of its threedimensional color solid while the definition of hue is relatively uncontroversial—it roughly satisfies the criterion that colors of the same perceived hue should have the same numerical hue—the definition of a lightness or value dimension is less obvious there are several possibilities depending on the purpose and goals of the representation here are four of the most common  fig 12 three of these are also shown in fig 8  the simplest definition is just the average of the three components in the hsi model called intensity  fig 12a  this is simply the projection of a point onto the neutral axis—the vertical height of a point in our tilted cube the advantage is that together with euclideandistance calculations of hue and chroma this representation preserves distances and angles from the geometry of the rgb cube 23 25in the hsv hexcone model value is defined as the largest component of a color our m above  fig 12b  this places all three primaries and also all of the secondary colors—cyan yellow and magenta—into a plane with white forming a hexagonal pyramid out of the rgb cube 11in the hsl bihexcone model lightness is defined as the average of the largest and smallest color components  fig 12c  this definition also puts the primary and secondary colors into a plane but a plane passing halfway between white and black the resulting color solid is a doublecone similar to ostwald’s shown above 12a more perceptually relevant alternative is to use luma y ′ as a lightness dimension  fig 12d  luma is the weighted average of gammacorrected r g and b based on their contribution to perceived lightness long used as the monochromatic dimension in color television broadcast for the rec 709 primaries used in s rgb y ′ 709 021 r  072 g  007 b for the rec 601 ntsc primaries y ′ 601≈ 030 r  059 g  011 b for other primaries different coefficients should be used 26 jall four of these leave the neutral axis alone that is for colors with r  g  b any of the four formulations yields a lightness equal to the value of r g or b for a graphical comparison see fig 13 below saturation  editfig 14a–d in both hsl and hsv saturation is simply the chroma scaled to fill the interval 0 1 for every combination of hue and lightness or value when encoding colors in a huelightnesschroma or huevaluechroma model using the definitions from the previous two sections model not all combinations of lightness or value and chroma are meaningful that is half of the colors denotable using h ∈ 0° 360° c ∈ 0 1 and v ∈ 0 1 fall outside the rgb gamut the gray parts of the slices in figure 14 the creators of these models considered this a problem for some uses for example in a color selection interface with two of the dimensions in a rectangle and the third on a slider half of that rectangle is made of unused space now imagine we have a slider for lightness the user’s intent when adjusting this slider is potentially ambiguous how should the software deal with outofgamut colors or conversely if the user has selected as colorful as possible a dark purple and then shifts the lightness slider upward what should be done would the user prefer to see a lighter purple still as colorful as possible for the given hue and lightness or a lighter purple of exactly the same chroma as the original color 12to solve problems such as these the hsl and hsv models scale the chroma so that it always fits into the range 0 1 for every combination of hue and lightness or value calling the new attribute saturation in both cases fig 14 to calculate either simply divide the chroma by the maximum chroma for that value or lightness 0 0 0 1fig 15a–b in hsi saturation shown in the slice on the right is roughly the chroma relative to lightness also common is a model with dimensions i h 2 c 2 shown in the slice on the left notice that the hue in these slices is the same as the hue above but h differs slightly from h 2 the hsi model commonly used for computer vision which takes h 2 as a hue dimension and the component average i intensity as a lightness dimension does not attempt to fill a cylinder by its definition of saturation instead of presenting color choice or modification interfaces to end users the goal of hsi is to facilitate separation of shapes in an image saturation is therefore defined in line with the psychometric definition chroma relative to lightness  fig 15  see the use in image analysis section of this article 28 0 01using the same name for these three different definitions of saturation leads to some confusion as the three attributes describe substantially different color relationships in hsv and hsi the term roughly matches the psychometric definition of a chroma of a color relative to its own lightness but in hsl it does not come close even worse the word saturation is also often used for one of the measurements we call chroma above  c or c 2  examples  editall

reference to hsl or hsv coordinates or to coordinates in a model based on the intensity or luma defined above in particular tools with a pair of hue and saturation sliders are commonplace dating to at least the late1980s but various more complicated color tools have also been implemented for instance the unix image viewer and color editor xv allowed six userdefinable hue  h ranges to be rotated and

hsi or related models are often used in computer vision and image analysis for feature detection or image segmentation the applications of such tools include object detection for instance in robot vision object recognition for instance of faces text or license plates contentbased image retrieval and analysis of medical images 28for the most part computer vision algorithms used on color images are straightforward extensions to algorithms designed for grayscale images for instance kmeans or fuzzy clustering of pixel colors or canny edge detection at the simplest each color component is separately passed through the same algorithm it is important therefore that the features of interest can be distinguished in the color dimensions used because the r g and b components of an objects color in a digital image are all correlated with the amount of light hitting the object and therefore with each other image descriptions in terms of those components make object discrimination difficult descriptions in terms of huelightnesschroma or huelightnesssaturation are often more relevant 28starting in the late 1970s transformations like hsv or hsi were used as a compromise between effectiveness for segmentation and computational complexity they can be thought of as similar in approach and intent to the neural processing used by human color vision without agreeing in particulars if the goal is object detection roughly separating hue lightness and chroma or saturation is effective but there is no particular reason to strictly mimic human color response john kender’s 1976 master’s thesis proposed the hsi model ohta et al 1980 instead used a model made up of dimensions similar to those we have called i α and β in recent years such models have continued to see wide use as their performance compares favorably with more complex models and their computational simplicity remains compelling r 28 34 35 36disadvantages  editfig 20a the s rgb gamut mapped in cielab space notice that the lines pointing to the red green and blue primaries are not evenly spaced by hue angle and are of unequal length the primaries also have different l  values fig 20b the adobe rgb gamut mapped in cielab space also notice that these two rgb spaces have different gamuts and thus will have different hsl and hsv representations while hsl hsv and related spaces serve well enough to for instance choose a single color they ignore much of the complexity of color appearance essentially they trade off perceptual relevance for computation speed from a time in computing history highend 1970s graphics workstations or mid1990s consumer desktops when more sophisticated models would have been too computationally expensive shsl and hsv are simple transformations of rgb which preserve symmetries in the rgb cube unrelated to human perception such that its r g and b corners are equidistant from the neutral axis and equally spaced around it if we plot the rgb gamut in a more perceptuallyuniform space such as cielab see below  it becomes immediately clear that the red green and blue primaries do not have the same lightness or chroma or evenly spaced hues furthermore different rgb displays use different primaries and so have different gamuts because hsl and hsv are defined purely with reference to some rgb space they are not absolute color spaces to specify a color precisely requires reporting not only hsl or hsv values but also the characteristics of the rgb space they are based on including the gamma correction in use if we take an image and extract the hue saturation and lightness or value components and then compare these to the components of the same name as defined by color scientists we can quickly see the difference perceptually for example examine the following images of a fire breather  fig 13  the original is in the s rgb colorspace cielab l  is a ciedefined achromatic lightness quantity dependent solely on the perceptually achromatic luminance y but not the mixedchromatic components x or z of the ciexyz colorspace from which the s rgb colorspace itself is derived and it is plain that this appears similar in perceptual lightness to the original color image luma is roughly similar but differs somewhat at high chroma where it deviates most from depending solely on the true achromatic luminance  y or equivalently l  and is influenced by the colorimetric chromaticity  xy or equivalently ab of cielab hsl l and hsv v by contrast diverge substantially from perceptual lightness fig 13a color photograph s rgb colorspace fig 13b cielab l  further transformed back to s rgb for consistent display fig 13c rec 601 luma y ′ fig 13d component average intensity i fig 13e hsv value v fig 13f hsl lightness l though none of the dimensions in these spaces match their perceptual analogs the value of hsv and the saturation of hsl are particular offenders in hsv the blue primary and white are held to have the same value even though perceptually the blue primary has somewhere around 10 of the luminance of white the exact fraction depends on the particular rgb primaries in use in hsl a mix of 100 red 100 green 90 blue—that is a very light yellow —is held to have the same saturation as the green primary even though the former color has almost no chroma or saturation by the conventional psychometric definitions such perversities led cynthia brewer expert in color scheme choices for maps and information displays to tell the american statistical association computer science offers a few poorer cousins to these perceptual spaces that may also turn up in your software interface such as hsv and hls they are easy mathematical transformations of rgb and they seem to be perceptual systems because they make use of the hue–lightnessvalue–saturation terminology but take a close look don’t be fooled perceptual color dimensions are poorly scaled by the color specifications that are provided in these and some other systems for example saturation and lightness are confounded so a saturation scale may also contain a wide range of lightnesses for example it may progress from white to green which is a combination of both lightness and saturation likewise hue and lightness are confounded so for example a saturated yellow and saturated blue may be designated as the same ‘lightness’ but have wide differences in perceived lightness these flaws make the systems difficult to use to control the look of a color scheme in a systematic manner if much tweaking is required to achieve the desired effect the system offers little benefit over grappling with raw specifications in rgb or cmy 37if these problems make hsl and hsv problematic for choosing colors or color schemes they make them much worse for image adjustment hsl and hsv as brewer mentioned confound perceptual colormaking attributes so that changing any dimension results in nonuniform changes to all three perceptual dimensions and distorts all of the color relationships in the image for instance rotating the hue of a pure dark blue toward green will also reduce its perceived chroma and increase its perceived lightness the latter is grayer and lighter but the same hue rotation will have the opposite impact on lightness and chroma of a lighter bluishgreen— to the latter is more colorful and slightly darker in the example below  fig 21  the image on the left a is the original photograph of a green turtle in the middle image b we have rotated the hue  h of each color by −30° while keeping hsv value and saturation or hsl lightness and saturation constant in the image on the right c we make the same rotation to the hslhsv hue of each color but then we force the cielab lightness  l  a decent approximation of perceived lightness to remain constant notice how the hueshifted middle version without such a correction dramatically changes the perceived lightness relationships between colors in the image in particular the turtle’s shell is much darker and has less contrast and the background water is much lighter fig 21a color photograph fig 21b hslhsv hue of each color shifted by −30° fig 21c hue shifted but cielab lightness  l  kept as in the original because hue is a circular quantity represented numerically with a discontinuity at 360° it is difficult to use in statistical computations or quantitative comparisons analysis requires the use of circular statistics 38 furthermore hue is defined piecewise in 60° chunks where the relationship of lightness value and chroma to r g and b depends on the hue chunk in question this definition introduces discontinuities corners which can plainly be seen in horizontal slices of hsl or hsv 39charles poynton digital video expert lists the above problems with hsl and hsv in his color faq and concludes that hsb and hls were developed to specify numerical hue saturation and brightness or hue lightness and saturation in an age when users had to specify colors numerically the usual formulations of hsb and hls are flawed with respect to the properties of color vision now that users can choose colors visually or choose colors related to other media such as pantone  or use perceptuallybased systems like luv and lab hsb and hls should be abandoned 40other cylindricalcoordinate color models  editfig 22 runge’s farbenkugel 1810 fig 23 munsell’s balanced color sphere 1900 from a color notation 1905 see also color solid the creators of hsl and hsv were far from the first to imagine colors fitting into conic or spherical shapes with neutrals running from black to white in a central axis and hues corresponding to angles around that axis similar arrangements date back to the 18th century and continue to be developed in the most modern and scientific models a pair of the most influential older models are philipp otto runge ’s 1810 farbenkugel color sphere and the early20thcentury munsell color system albert munsell began with a spherical arrangement in his 1905 book a color notation but he wished to properly separate colormaking attributes into separate dimensions which he called hue value and chroma and after taking careful measurements of perceptual responses he realized that no symmetrical shape would do so he reorganized his system into a lumpy blob 41 42 tmunsell’s system became extremely popular the de facto reference for american color standards—used not only for specifying the color of paints and crayons but also eg electrical wire beer and soil color—because it was organized based on perceptual measurements specified colors via an easily learned and systematic triple of numbers because the color chips sold in the munsell book of color covered a wide gamut and remained stable over time rather than fading and because it was effectively marketed by munsell’s company in the 1940s the optical society of america made extensive measurements and adjusted the arrangement of munsell colors issuing a set of renotations the trouble with the munsell system for computer graphics applications is that its colors are not specified via any set of simple equations but only via its foundational measurements effectively a lookup table converting from rgb ↔ munsell requires interpolating between that table’s entries and is extremely computationally expensive in comparison with converting from rgb ↔ hsl or rgb ↔ hsv which only requires a few simple arithmetic operations 43 44 45 46in densitometry a model quite similar to the hue defined above is used for describing colors of cmyk process inks in 1953 frank preucil developed two geometric arrangements of hue the preucil hue circle and the preucil hue hexagon analogous to our h and h 2 respectively but defined relative to idealized cyan yellow and magenta ink colors the preucil hue error  of an ink indicates the difference in the hue circle between its color and the hue of the corresponding idealized ink color the grayness of an ink is m  m where m and m are the minimum and maximum among the amounts of idealized cyan magenta and yellow in a density measurement 47the swedish natural color system ncs widely used in europe takes a similar approach to the ostwald bicone shown earlier because it attempts to fit color into a familiarly shaped solid based on  phenomenological  instead of photometric or psychological characteristics it suffers from some of the same disadvantages as hsl and hsv in particular its lightness dimension differs from perceived lightness because it forces colorful yellow red green and blue into a plane 48the international commission on illumination cie developed the xyz model for describing the colors of light spectra in 1931 but its goal was to match human visual metamerism rather than to be perceptually uniform geometrically in the 1960s and 70s attempts were made to transform xyz colors into a more relevant geometry influenced by the munsell system these efforts culminated in the 1976 cieluv and cielab models the dimensions of these models—  l  u  v  and  l  a  b  respectively—are cartesian based on the opponent process theory of color but both are also often described using polar coordinates—  l  c  uv h  uv or  l  c  ab h  ab and also hcl where l  is lightness c  is chroma and h  is hue angle officially both cielab and cieluv were created for their color difference metrics ∆ e  ab and ∆ e  uv particularly for use defining color tolerances but both have become widely used as color order systems and color appearance models including in computer graphics and computer vision for example gamut mapping in icc color management is usually performed in cielab space and adobe photoshop includes a cielab mode for editing images cielab and cieluv geometries are much more perceptually relevant than many others such as rgb hsl hsv yuvyiqycb cr or xyz but are not perceptually perfect and in particular have trouble adapting to unusual lighting conditions 43 17 49 48 50 51 uthe cie’s most recent model ciecam02 cam stands for color appearance model is more theoretically sophisticated and computationally complex than earlier models its aims are to fix several of the problems with models such as cielab and cieluv and to explain not only responses in carefully controlled experimental environments but also to model the color appearance of realworld scenes its dimensions j lightness c chroma and h hue define a polarcoordinate geometry 43 48converting to rgb  editto convert from hsl or hsv to rgb we essentially invert the steps listed above as before r g b ∈ 0 1  first we compute chroma by multiplying saturation by the maximum chroma for a given lightness or value next we find the point on one of the bottom three faces of the rgb cube which has the same hue and chroma as our color and therefore projects onto the same point in the chromaticity plane finally we add equal amounts of r g and b to reach the proper lightness or value gfrom hsl  editgiven a

introducing hsl they called hsl lightness intensity called hsl saturation relative chroma called hsv saturation saturation and called hsv value value they carefully and unambiguously described and compared three models huechromaintensity huerelative chromaintensity and huevaluesaturation unfortunately later authors were less fastidious and current usage of these terms is inconsistent and often misleading the name hexcone for hexagonal pyramid was coined in smith 1978 and stuck for instance a 1982 study by berk et al found that users were better at describing colors in terms of hsl than rgb coordinates after being taught both systems but were much better still at describing them in terms of the naturallanguage cns model which uses names such as very dark grayish yellowgreen or medium strong bluish purple this shouldn’t be taken as gospel however a 1987 study by schwarz et al found that users could match colors using rgb controls faster than with hsl controls a 1999 study by douglas and kirkpatrick found that the visual feedback in the user interface mattered more than the particular color model in use for user matching speed 7 8 9 clearly if color appearance is to be described in a systematic mathematical way definitions of the phenomena being described need to be precise and universally agreed upon 16 in levkowitz and herman’s formulation r g and b stand for the voltages on the guns of a crt display which might have different maxima and so their cartesian gamut could be a box of any unequal dimensions other definitions commonly use integer values in the range 0 255 storing the value for each component in one byte we define the rgb gamut to be a unit cube for convenience because it simplifies and clarifies the math also in general hsl and hsv are today computed directly from gammacorrected r ′ g ′ and b ′ —for instance in s rgb space—but when the models were developed might have been transformations of a linear rgb space early authors don’t address gamma correction at all we will drop the primes and the labels r g and b should be taken to stand for the three attributes of the origin rgb space whether or not it is gamma corrected using the chroma here not only agrees with the original joblove and greenberg 1978 paper but is also in the proper spirit of the psychometric definition of the term some models call this attribute saturation —for instance adobe photoshop ’s saturation blend mode—but such use is even more confusing than the use of the term in hsl or hsv especially when two substantially different definitions are used side by side a b most of the computer graphics papers and books discussing hsl or hsv have a formula or algorithm describing them formally our formulas which follow are some mix of those see for instance agoston 2005 or foley 1995 hanbury and serra 2002 put a great deal of effort into explaining why what we call chroma here can be written as max  r g b − min  r g b  and showing that this value is a seminorm they reserve the name chroma for the euclidean norm in the chromaticity plane our c 2 and call this hexagonal distance saturation instead as part of their ihls model in the following the multiplication of hue by 60°—that is 360°6—can be seen as the hexagonalgeometry analogue of the conversion from radians to degrees a multiplication by 360°2 π the circumference of a unit circle is 2 π the circumference of a unit hexagon is 6 for a more specific discussion of the term luma see charles poynton 2008 see also rgb color spacespecifications photoshop exclusively uses the ntsc coefficients for its luminosity blend mode regardless of the rgb color space involved 27 the first nine colors in this table were chosen by hand and the last ten colors were chosen at random see smith 1978 many of these screenshots were taken from the guidebook and the rest were gathered from image search results for instance a tool in illustrator cs4 and adobe’s related web tool kuler both allow users to define color schemes based on hsv relationships but with a hue circle modified to better match the ryb model used traditionally by painters the web tools color jack color wizard and color

gis calls its mapsymbol gradients color ramps current versions of arc gis can use cielab instead for defining them 30 for instance the first version of photoshop had an hslbased tool see photoshop huesaturation in the guidebook for screenshots 31 32 photoshop’s documentation explains that eg luminosity creates a result color with the hue and saturation of the base color and the luminance of the blend color 33 the ohta et al model has parameters i 1  r  g  b 3 i 2  r − b 2 i 3 2 g − r − b 4 i 1 is the same as our i and i 2 and i 3 are similar to our β and α respectively except that a where α points in the direction of r in the chromaticity plane i 3 points in the direction of g and b the parameters have a different linear scaling which avoids the √ 3 of our β most of the disadvantages
