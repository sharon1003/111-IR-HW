garrick saito answered aug 20 2013 · upvoted by ken madell ma music composition  learning piano montclair state university 1993 · author has 189k answers and 716m answer views im a beginning adult piano student or at least i was five years ago and can relate to having learned the instrument as an adult with no prior music background ive always wanted to learn the piano as a child my mother played a little but never did no point regretting what i cannot change i think the best thing that you can do to prepare yourself for the journey youre about to begin is to realize that it is in fact a journey the journey is one which requires a strong commitment on your part to learn many adult students never make it past the first year of studies because they did not realize that making progress on the instrument requires daily practice just as you did not learn to read and write going to school once a week it is virtually impossible to progress by practicing once a week most piano teachers recommend practicing from 30 to 60 minutes per day even if you can get 15 minutes of practice in on busy days that is better than nothing practicing 35 hours once a week is not the same thing as 30 minutes per day concepts take time to settle in and be digested it is not a test your can cram for for many adults this presents challenges if they have to balance practice with a job with long hours family commitments and other social obligations however the bottom line is that you must make time for it if you want it bad enough no matter how busy you are youll find the time another thing to keep in mind is that the journey will be simultaneously gratifying and frustrating that isnt meant to try to scare you but there will be times where it doesnt seem like youre progressing hey i practiced for two hours straight and i still cant execute this passage properly those words were likely said by every person in history who has tried to tame this beast the learn is so minute that you will not notice it over short periods of time its like watching paint dry or hair grow however over time months and years youll be able to hear and see all of your hard work pay off accept the fact that this is not a ukulele and that youll be strumming a song at the end of the afternoon the complexities and beauty of the instrument require specific skills each one must be practiced until you get it right how long does it take it takes as long as it takes it could be days weeks months or perhaps even years that is rare though each of these skills builds upon one another and over time youll develop an arsenal of skills that will be at your disposal find the right teacher one you click with and one who will help you to achieve your goals they will be your guide on this journey offering you feedback correcting your mistakes listening with a discerning ear and providing you encouragement along the way keep the lines of communication open and let them know what you like and what you dont like if for example your goal is to play jazz or pop and all they teach is classical that is consideration that should be made before starting your lessons as for studying alongside your child that question is best left to your teacher to me im not a teacher by the way it seems distracting to have two people in the lesson you will both progress at different rates and your teachers attention to either one of you will be split into two i think id suggest separate lessons most piano teachers ive spoken two suggest that between the ages of 57 is an ideal time for a child to begin lessons any younger than that and many have expressed concerns with attention span as for your piano buy the best you can afford and upgrade when finances permit i would very strongly advise against an unweighted keyboard typically found with lowend digital pianos they will not be replicating the feel of an acoustic piano very accurately and as a result you may develop some bad technique which may prove to be hard to unlearn as you graduate to an acoustic your question is so broad i dont know where to end but if you have any specific questions im happen to entertain them good luck with your studies ive written

beginner how do i start learning piano online as a beginner can i learn piano online how can i learn piano as a beginner ask new question phil speed instructor and eternal student answered jan 18 2018so you want to learn piano as an adult thats a fantastic goal and one that millions of other people just like you have accomplished its not an easy road but you can take some simple steps that will make it go a lot easier for you here they are1 be honest about why you want to learn piano maybe you started learning piano as a child and just never really stuck with it thats fine but do you really want to play the piano now if you do then thats great if not you may not have the discipline to put in the time necessary to learn do you want to play classical music at recitals do you want to write your own jazz music do you just want to play popular songs at parties you should decide what motivates you to learn as this will help you get through the hours of practice ahead of you and it will guide you to the methods and music that will give you the best results2 decide whether to selfteach or hire a tutor it used to be that you had to hire a teacher to learn piano but with the amazing advances in technology from the internet dvd and more you can now effectively teach yourself piano evaluate your learning style and maybe try some of the excellent selflearning piano methods available to see if theyre effective for you3 find the method that works for you remember how i asked if you want to play classical or jazz or pop tunes this is an important question to answer because different piano methods prepare you for different types of playing the traditional route to playing piano was to spend years practicing so you can play classical music in recital environments but if thats not what you want you may find it far more efficient to play jazz and pop tunes which are generally simpler new piano teaching courses and methods focus on these types of music so that the student makes progress faster4 get the right equipment no matter what method of piano you choose youre going to need to practice and that means you need a piano the more comfortable you are with the equipment you have the more practice youll be able to put in and the faster youll progress the first question youll have to answer is digital vs acoustic most piano players prefer the sound of an acoustic piano but a digital piano offers some real advantages including the ability to fit it into a space apartment as well as the ability to play at any time without disturbing others these advantages may mean that youll end up playing more than you would with an acoustic even though the acoustic piano sounds a bit better36k views · view upvoterspromoted by mi online want to learn guitar

answers and 2182k answer views great question and thank you for the in depth info great news you already have the most important ingredient passion if youre not passionate about music in general and more specifically learning to play the piano then youll never get good at it more great news  you dont need to purchase an acoustic piano you can start with an inexpensive casio type keyboard easily under 200 for starting out it doesnt need to be a full 88note keyboard 61 keys are plenty to get started you are on the right track with the john thompsons childrens books dont be shy or embarrassed about continuing with childrens books right through all the levels find an exercise book i recommend hanon i believe there is now an easier beginners hanon but if you cant find it dont be intimidated by the hanon published by shirmer library youll see 16th notes all over the pages but just play them slow think of them as quarter notes then as you gain ability you can start increasing the tempo since your 5 12 year old son has an interest you can take this opportunity to teach him while youre teaching yourself the most difficult obstacle for you might be the amount of time you can spend practicing and playing for most players it takes quite a while to even just get pretty good so dont get discouraged everyone learns at different rates regardless of age so dont feel disadvantaged by your age youre still young anyways and since youre not putting yourself under pressure to expect to perform masterpieces in record time just take your time and enjoy the process think of it as a video game some games might take you a very long time before you can beat all the levels but you have fun getting there same with piano it may take a long time to beat all the levels and become a master but youll have fun getting there back to the issue of an acoustic piano eventually you will want one and the sooner the better i dont know what area you live in sound quite remote if the nearest piano teacher is 30 minutes away none the less craigslist always has cheap and free pianos listed all the time you will likely have to pay to move it usually about 300 maybe less if you know a few strong guys and one of them has a truck and hopefully you dont live on a third floor flat  you might be able to move the piano yourself but make sure its a decent piano dont worry too much about how it looks first make sure all the notes work make sure the pedals work mainly the pedal to the right for sustain  very important youll hardly ever use the pedal on the left damper  to play softer and i can guarantee youll never use the middle pedal if the piano even has one  which is a sostenuto pedal which sustains notes while others can be played staccato  no one ever uses it unless your extremely trained in classical or jazz you dont want the piano if its waayyy out of tune because it is likely that itll wont be able to be tuned or it wont stay in tune for very long if and when you do get an acoustic piano this will greatly increase your dexterity and nimbleness in your fingers as well as increase the overall strength in your hands it will also sound so much better that whats coming out of the cheap speakers of an inexpensive keyboard if youre never able to go acoustic there are excellent digital pianos on the market youll probably have to spend at least 100000 or again perhaps you can find a great deal on craigslist good luck please feel free to correspond if you have any questions136k views · view upvoters · answer requested by leann brown larson lorri robinson know organ now

14 to about 18 then i dropped music altogether now at 58 59 in june ive become the owner of a yamaha key arranger workstation psr710 which is fancy talk for a soupedup digital piano or pienanner if you want to annoy people im using alfreds adult course for my relearning the hanon book and first lessons in bach adult allinone course lessontheorytechnic level 1hanon the virtuoso pianist in sixty exercises complete schirmers library of musical classics vol 925first lessons in bach complete for the piano schirmers library of musical classicsyou are not too old to learn piano others have mentioned the old saying if you start doing something now in a year youll be a year older and be able to do x if you dont try in a year youll be a year older its always better to be able to do something new in your situation private lessons are almost a must im assuming you dont know any music theory any technique and cant read music these are all things its easier to learn to do with a teacher the technique is especially important because thats something you just cant learn from words or a video how to sit how to place your hands how to prevent injury to yourself how to get a particular sound  all this is technique be proactive in your learning  ask for popular music you can practice on its a lot more fun than just doing droning scales all the time although those are monstrously important and it will help keep you engaged make sure its something you know so that you know how its supposed to sound practice practice practice even 15 or 30 min here and there is better than no practice at all if youre worried about disturbing other people get a digital keyboard ones like mine are on e bay for 50 to 100 and a set of headphones and go crazy i think your son taking lessons is a great idea but separate lessons dont let how long it might take you discourage you playing is a wonderful outlet for stress i find when im practicing i enter that altered state of mind you get when youre exquisitely focused on what youre doing  artists know what im talking about 60 minutes or 2 hours can fly by when im noodling on the keyboard enjoy it have some fun piece you can bang out when youre just not getting what youre supposed to be learning today let off some steam even if its just frere jacques with the right hand before you know it youll have some chords you can add on the left hand and you can make it sound like a church hymn walk away when you get frustrated a lot of piano is building muscle memory and learning to translate what youre seeing into finger movements on the keys give your mind and your body a break dont be surprised at how physically and mentally tired you get practicing ill get up from an hours practice literally dripping with sweat making your hands and brain work together is hard but oh so worth it have fun 143k views · view upvoters taylor played piano for nearly a decade answered jun 10 2017the first thing i’d like to start off with is that it’s never too late to start playing piano don’t let your age set you back  if anything use it as a reason to work even harderprivate lessons are a good way to improve technique in particular as you have an expert on hand telling you what you’re physically doing wrong in addition it’s always good to have a second opinion on how you’re playing i find that my music teacher sometimes comes up with ideas  such as phrasing  that i never would have thought ofhowever a very important thing to understand is that you will never be able to play piano musically rather than technically if you do not listen to it some people can rattle off very difficult fast paced pieces with no problem at all but are unable to play it musically and with emotion listen as much as possible to whatever kind of music you want to learn it gives you a deeper understanding of how it’s played for example if you want to learn how to improvise jazz then listen to jazz musicians improvising your brain will eventually understand the ins and outs of jazz improv and you’ll find that you suddenly have ideas and ground when you try it yourself of course it goes without saying it is also important to have good technique as well as for learning a piece by ear it takes time and practice as you play more and more your brain and fingers start to coordinate and learn the intervals between the keys so that eventually you’ll be able to ‘feel’ what the notes are when you try and play things by ear this is a lot easier if you have perfect or relative pitch the ability to know what a note is just by hearing it or the ability to immediately identify intervals between notes but if you don’t then it just takes timethe main problem beginners have is the movement of the fingers as the hand is not used to moving in the manner needed to play piano fluently there are two obvious ways to combat this  the first learn your scales  this may seem very tedious and annoying but trust me you will be glad when you realise that your fingers can move up and down the piano easily which makes playing a lot less hard work for you and the second to just practise as much as possibleas for your son you’d be surprised as to how quickly little kids can learn when they put their minds to it i started playing piano when i was around three or four and i remember picking it up fairly quickly it will be harder for your son to learn than for you but it’s always a good idea to allow your child to explore music from as early an age as possible if they express an interest in it it just means a little more experiencefinally the most important thing of all  enjoy yourself piano can be a lot of work sometimes but it pays off in the end if you persevere if you’re not enjoying yourself then don’t bother you will never be able to play with conviction if you don’t believe in what you play good luck369 views dezi rivera answered sep 11 2016lets begin with the basics of your wants a piano there are some decent practice pianos out there but i am personally a yamaha person it has the best quality will sound like an acoustic piano if you want it to my dad had a keyboard and purchased a pedal seperate and i used to plug in an amp or some professional headphones to practice very important that if you are using headphones make sure they are studio quality many headphones focus on bass or treble but only studio quality will be perfectly balanced so you can really focus on each sound coming from your keyboard second if you are more interested in playing by ear than sight reading it would be more beneficial for you to find a teacher that focuses on jazzbased training more than classicalbased classical will teach you theory and sightreading which is very important but jazz is all about improvisation expanding from basics and listening to others to pick out your part with that said you may want to do some reading on music theorys fundementals and which notes are which keys when reading sheet music it will be immensly easier for your child i reccomend he come with you pay for two classes not only does music help expand his talent and is very fun but it also helps his cognitive ability and helps in things like math especially if they learn how to read sheet music i thank my parents for my excellent act scores because they started me in childrens music academy when i was 3 i learned sightreading piano guitar different percussion instruments and how to play by ear when i saw equations it looked like sheet music to me everyone thought i was crazy but music became a huge equation that led to a solution besides that i was able to find something that brought me true joy and peace start him early he will thank you and what more fun way than to learn with his parent bonding every step of the way sorry got excited about that one otherwise just watch some youtube videos explaining basic music theory and how to read music that will probably already be more than most of the teachers students know good luck on your journey 127k views · view upvoters alex kritchevsky works at amazoncom answered may 27 2013 · author has 207 answers and 4673k answer views1 dont take lessons with your kid 2 just start playing it doesnt really matter what try to play whatever you want youll have to be a bit studious to learn to read music but you definitely want to but just play a ton  ive seen people learn entirely on their own just by playing songs they love all the time itll start hard and slow and sloppy and after a few months or a year or whatever itll be fantastic and youll be able to handle lots of songs 3 youll be fine starting with a keyboard though make sure it has weighted keys so you actually strengthen those muscles its probably a smaller investment 4 i started piano at age 6 it couldve been sooner it couldve been later i stuck with it and got good at it because i enjoyed it thats what matters 5 there is nothing wrong with starting at 27 it feels weird because so many people start as kids but what does that mean and im trying to start learning to draw now anyway cause i missed out on that as a kid145k views · view upvoters · answer

important groundwork i would have suggested doing—think about what kind of music you want to learn and set some broad goals get an instrument electronic is acceptable but make sure it has a hammer action which will be a little more expensive and heavier and then find a teacher you’ve done those things so i think you have a great start when you work with a teacher you pretty much need to trust that teacher so i think it would be wrong for me to give too many specifics here are some ideas thoughtheory is going to be important and especially for improvising improvising is not something you do “down the road”… it’s something you can start doing from the beginning for instance just start exploring on the black keys to start… you might be surprised… getting a good grasp of music theory early on will make everything else easieras for playing by ear just do it try and try again make mistakes listen carefully fix those mistakes a good teacher is basically going to walk you through that process and you can start that right now too learning theory will help you understand what you’re hearing and will help to make this process easieri would not spend much time on exercises scales and arpeggios are not really exercises hanon czerny etc are exercises and are mostly a waste of your time if something hurts it is wrong many teachers don’t understand how to teach basic mechanics and if you find yourself in discomfort you’re doing something wrong piano is not about building muscles or strength if you doubt this think how many construction workers could crush a pianist’s hand in their grip yet the construction worker would be helpless on the keyboard it’s about coordination and using everything the right way together last don’t be too intimidated that you’re starting late you aren’t going to be a professional pianist… that ship has already sailed if you’d started when you were 16 you probably couldn’t have done it at least in the classical world but you will find that your study skills and ability to focus will let you learn much more quickly than you might expect… combine this with a little passion and drive… and you will likely make progress that will exceed all your expectations have fun106 views quora user astronomer nasa education nationalstate parks explorer answered may 25 2017 · author has 468 answers and 3749k answer views i took piano lessons for 1 year at the age of 8 when i still lived in russia honestly teachers in russia are too formal and too strict they made me hate everything about learning process and i gave up after one year in my mid twenties i regretted not continuing with free music education that one year however was enough for me to carry on an ability to read music on lowerintermediate level and play some of my favorite songs mostly using memorized chords on the left hand and notes on the right i can improvise here and there and play some songs by ear simplified to lowerintermediate level it’s satisfying enough to me and i can impress my friends and family with my playing skills  they think it’s complicated while it’s actually still a child’s play if this is what you want to do you can master it in 1–2 years with new modern techniques and just play it for pleasure you’ll need to plan on practicing for 2–3 a day every day with one day break in a week now 3 years ago i discovered a music production company called “two steps from hell” their neoorchestral music is out of this world some great pianists make arrangements of their orchestral music on piano you can check mark fowler or andrew wrangell on you tube for instance playing “two steps from hell” and you can compare them to the original piece they also provide sheet music that they create so my goal is to learn at least one piece of “two steps from hell” using their sheet music about a month ago i got a digital piano played couple of my favorite songs and thought “ok let me get to business with one of the tsfh pieces” i put it on the sheet music holder played couple of right hand notes and almost burst into tears i had no coordination and no ability to sight read fast enough for something as complicated as that i composed myself got out michael aaron’s piano book grade 1 and started practicing from the very beginning it took me 3 months of 1–2 hour daily practice to master that one grade it gets harder and harder with every grade hopefully i can play tsfh in my 40s the fact of life is it’s so difficult for adults to find hours for daily piano practice if you can spare at least 2 hours a day to practice you should be able to play something like regular difficulty level “moonlight sonata” in about 23 years good luck i’ll need it too 563 views michael glenn williams pianist composer teacher answered aug 6 2015 · author has 98 answers and 469k answer views you sound motivated by the sound of the piano something like moonlight sonata is definitely a piano piece pop songs and video game pieces are not really piano pieces listen to the video game pianist on you tube if you like what you hear id suggest focusing on the pop songs and video game songs and forget about moonlight sonata or easier classical pieces for now if you dont like what you hear then maybe classical is better for you dont try to do both video gamepop and classical at the beginning they are very different and need different approaches for video gamepop it is perfectly ok to play them by ear and to learn them by rote by copying what you see and hear on you tube or from your teacher and friends without using sheet music for classical the world is divided into those who think starting out by rote is ok ie yamaha school approach and those who think it is not ok its great you are supportive of your son studying start him right away show interest in his lessons and be a parent help him to practice on a regular schedule114k views · view upvoters jason black answered mar 20 2017i personally think that its a great idea to begin piano at any age the truth is one can learn to play any musical instrument even in ones 80s there is no special technique needed for adults to learn piano except to simply sit down and learn it practice makes perfect there is significant evidence that playing music is beneficial to older people improves memory brain activity and promotes longer and happier lives and although i personally wouldn’t agree with your choice of purchasing a digital keyboard i can see where you’re coming from luxury grand piano costs a lot and not everybody can afford it but i always viewed it as a family heirloom that could be passed from generations upright pianos are another way to go sometimes with great quality and less costly anyway it is a nice thought back to the original question depending on your level of dedication it appears as if you are very dedicated you might start with simple internet lessons and then progress on to a private tutor for more advanced study that would save you some money the most crucial thing here is not to give up at the start if you’re unsure whether you are ready to fully commit in the very beginning then it is better to go straight to a private teacher who will keep you working and push you to succeed17k views anonymous answered oct 4 2017the easiest possible way to learn piano is robin hall’s piano for all lessons is the best value for money piano course i have had the pleasure of working through i found it to be full of tricks and tips i never knew existed before in the world of learning to play the piano piano for all is for those who want to start playing without mastering music theory most traditional courses focus so much on the theoretical aspect that the actual playing of the piano is left behind not with this course it gets right to the heart of the matter that way you have a better overall understanding of music you get to see the big picture right from the start it contains as many as 200 video lessons 500 audio lessons as well as 9 ebooks it is available in downloadable format but if you prefer you can get an actual physical copy it’s quite easy to set up and works on any device – pc mac ipad iphone or any android tablet or smartphone one of the biggest pluses of piano for all is that it gets you playing popular music extremely quickly true the tunes may not be terribly complex but they’re definitely not “twinkle twinkle” either as a student being able to play songs you actually enjoy makes the learning process more engaging more fun and gives a greater sense of satisfaction have stevie wonder or ray charles ever seen music sheets i’m not putting down music theory because it is very important but i hope you get my drift the most important thing is to be able to play and to be quite fair piano for all does go into some aspects of music theory and sight reading another great thing about piano for all is the fact that it’s very motivating it makes you want to learn it’s fun and doesn’t seem like work this is so important this is how the best players learned to play they learned to play for fun piano lessons with a music teacher can cost you hundreds even thousands of dollars but an incredible course like piano for all costs just 3900 off the internet huh and you get so many times more value in this downloadable course these same lessons if you had to learn them one step at a time with a live piano teacher would cost you several thousands check out this video to see how easy the system is3k views · view upvoters ruth power played for 15 years piano music editor course creator answered oct 12 2017 · author has 122 answers and 4388k answer views starting any new pursuit requires a certain amount of passion to get you going after a certain point discipline needs to take over for sure  but in the beginning and throughout your piano journey you need to have passion  motivation that motivation comes from having a goal and a place of inspiration the fact that you’re asking this question indicates that you are already passionate about the piano in some way keep a hold of thatit’s this passion that will drive you forward through the hard work it’s this passion for the instrument that will fuel you through the tough parts but also make the achievements that much sweeter learning something new as an adult can be nervewracking the thought of putting ourselves in a situation where we have to learn completely new skills and start from the beginning is a humbling one but whether you have always wanted to play but never did or if you are returning to the instrument after a hiatus learning the piano doesnt need to be scary…there are a series of simple steps that you need to take one at a time in order to build your foundational knowledge and technique and start having fun with it as soon as possible don’t become a ‘serious’ piano student until a day comes when it is actually a professional pursuit always keep creativity experimentation expression and relaxation as your main priorities and you will have a great journey with piano i am holding a free online workshop on this very topic next week wednesday 18th october 2017 please join mefind out more here if you see this

piece but it may be possible to you after finishing some other pieces that will present you important concepts that will be required to play this beethoven’s piece at least from the version i just saw

like you are giving yourself a good start with getting some training material and then taking private lessons anytime you are learning something new you take baby steps until you start getting used to it make sure you are able to dedicate a set amount of time where you can focus on learning without getting distracted this can be anywhere from 30minutes to a few hours this is key in the beginning because you’ll learn the fundamentals early on and if for some reason you go a long period where you have to put your studies on hold when you come back it’ll be easy to pick it back up it would also be good to learn “best practices” from experienced pianists on how to move your hands across the keys if you pick up a bad habit you start to get used to it and it becomes harder to get away from that bad habit example if you tend to bite your nails when getting a little stressed out it becomes hard to train yourself to not do that above all practice even after your first day or two of private lessons practice what you learned here and there it doesn’t have to be on a piano it could be you just sitting at a desk tapping on it like it were a piano you are training your fingers to get used to the movements it would be doing on a keyboard for your son i would say it would be a good idea to give them a shot at it to see if it really is something that they would like to do it would be a great idea for both of you to take lessons at the same time it would be a good and fun experience for the both of you your child will probably enjoy spending time with you learning it would be like a game for him try to beat my parent at learning how to play at least i would look at it like that825 views dion kara over 20 years teaching and performing experience answered jun 26 2016 · author has 536

have positive way of looking at things as far as taking lessons on concecutive days it needs to be done correctly or you may not get the most out of those lessons normally you take a lesson your teacher gives you something to work on and you go home and come back once you can play what your teacher sent you home with this may take a week or two but you do not come back until you are ready if you are ok with having your teacher monitor your practises then that could be a good way to utilise having lessons on concecutive days the great classical guitarist john williams not to be confused with the composer of the same name had his fatherteacher monitor his practise sessions when he was younger and it helped him develop what many consider to be the benchmark for classical guitar playing technique so having your lessons divided up in to learning sessions and practising sessions could be beneficial the following is an easy method for beginners to get started in my experience this is something that gets good fast results for piano guitar ukulele and bass guitar there are three things that work best for my students regular if possible frequent practise working on a mixture of exercises to help build correct technique learning versions of the songs you want to play that are at your level of ability make sure that your instrument is always accessible always have it in the place apart from work or school where you spend the most time one of the things that has helped my students is using 510 minutes of spare time to fit a quick practise session in if this is done often you will be surprised at the progress you make i have also found that the students that use these shorter periods to work on technical exercises tend to improve faster than the students that work on pieces or songs working on technique sounds boring but it will help you learn to play better in a shorter timeframe as well as making sure you dont end up cramps or pain in your hands or arms another habit that works very well is making sure that no matter how long or short your practise session is having a goal for every time you are on your instrument it will contribute to faster improvement the last thing i will say is if you do have longer sessions anything over 30 minutes try and have a break every 510 minutes for beginners or every 20 minutes for more experienced players a break can be a 5 minute change of exercise or song or an actual break the reason for the break is to make sure that you can remain focussed on your technique and form the sooner you can play music employing correct technique the easier it will become to play and you will improve a lot faster best of luck11k views · answer requested by efrain velazquez and edward marroquin1 2 3 next →
