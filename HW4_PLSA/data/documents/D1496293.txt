why do all rock stars die at 27 sex drugs  death  and rock posted jul 24 2011sharetweetemailmorehendrix morrison joplin cobain howell and now winehouse  it seems that the only way to make it really big in rock and roll is to die at the age of 27 especially now that rock and roll is dead anyway so was this amys last attempt to live like a rock star in the postrock xfactoramericas got talent era of wash down steriliased elevator pop i dont know what amy died of but at least poetically one is tempted to suggest that she could not cope with the lack of creative depth of the music industry which is apparently dead too and perhaps above all the lack of talent of her contemporaries but what made her totally different from her contemporaries was that she really was a troubled soul fighting the inner demons of creativity as opposed to an ephemeral brand at the disposal of twitter and ok magazine there was always a different layer of depth to amy one not found in rihanna adele or lady gaga  that layer is called authenticity and amy paid a high price for being authentic the others are just original but originality is a lot healthier than authenticity because your life is not at stake anyway back to the original question i will not pretend to provide a scientific answer but science is about identifying patterns first and explaining them next so how can we explain this pattern of famous rock stars living just until they are 27 are there any salient life events in adult development that could conflict with the needs or goals of talented artists especially in rock and roll can we draw any parallels in the biographies of these music icons and can personality theory help us understand these unusual events psychopathology tells us that all forms of mental illness are characterised by disruptive symptoms uncontrollable anxietyevoking annoying patterns of thought behaviour or affect that impair our capacity to love and work this is true from freud to the latest version of the dsm that is why addictions  which are covered extensively by other more knowledgeable bloggers here  are included in psychopathology manuals to be addicted to something is to damage your interpersonal relations and career aspirations whatever that  addiction  may be psychological physical legal illegal etc we know that hendrix howell cobain joplin and winehouse  as well as 90 of rock stars up to the 90s but probably just 30 of rock stars after the 00s  all had problems with drugs and that they had even bigger problems when they stopped taking them amy was seemingly clean now but drinking a lot like the others amy was selfmedicating and was probably manicdepressive as most of you will know bipolar disorder is the preferred diagnosis of eminent artists or exceptionally creative people personality theory tells us that our personality does not change very much after the age of 30 but that there are some general developmental changes in most peoples personality even after that age as we grow older we become more emotionally stable more conscientious more agreeable and less open to new experiences so it seems then that getting old is a major threat to our creative enterprises especially if you are a rock star most people become more conforming more adjusted more boring less creative the battle that the hendrixs winehouses or morrisons of this world may have faught  through their personality and art  was on one hand a battle against society they were rebellious souls who wanted to inject some freedom and change into a world they disliked despite being incredibly successful in the eyes of others and by most objective criteria for success on the other hand they may have been battling against their own selftransformation in fact in becoming successful they may have become a victim of the very system they were attempting to change the realisation that they were being consumed by others  a bit as if the che guevara had lived sufficiently long to see all those middleclass and rich kids wearing his tshirts dg of course  may have been too much to take now amy will become an even bigger brand and even an icon however it is hard to imagine that she would have cared about this this is what makes amy different from most of her contemporary celebrities who seem likely to fake and even cause their own death just in order to be more famous i think andy warhol killed rock and roll when he invented pop  amy was an anachronistic rock child her talent was the main cause of her success but also of her downfall in an era of creative mediocrity think david guetta or the black eye peas her public and the media seem to forgive her everything and turned her into a brand despite her unacceptable behaviour they left her with no escape not in this world and this is what the other 27 rock stars have in common with her they failed because they were too successful take part in our new personality survey and get instant feedback source jsshsharetweetemailmore32 comments
