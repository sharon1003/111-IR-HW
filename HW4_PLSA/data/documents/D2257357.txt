the water cycle reservoirs processes reservoirs elements on earth move among reservoirs which are storage places the earths reservoirs include solid earth bodies of water atmosphere and organisms just like the earth the water cycle has specific reservoirs too they are atmosphere clouds oceans and lakes organisms rivers groundwater and ice atmosphere the atmosphere is a reservoir for water when it is in the form of vapor clouds water is stored in the atmosphere as clouds which are just a large collection of tiny drops of water oceans lakes rivers oceans lakes and rivers are large expanses of water that collect water from precipitation organisms all living things contain water an human for example consists of 72 percent water organisms need water to survive even more so than food so we too are reservoirs for water groundwater groundwater makes up about twenty percent of the worlds fresh water supply which is about 061 of the entire worlds water including oceans and permanent ice this makes groundwater an important reservoir which can act as a natural storage that can buffer against shortages of surface water and during times of drought ice ice is just frozen water glaciers and ice caps around the world store huge amounts of water though not as much as groundwater comments
