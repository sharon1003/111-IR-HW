help alleviate bothersome symptoms it also contains a property that stimulates the bodys own defenses by producing antiinflammatory molecules called cytokines the leaves twigs branches and seeds of sambucus are toxic if ingested as are the berries if unripe so we dont recommend going out to gather your own plant instead try an overthecounter supplement such as sambucol which contains elderberry
