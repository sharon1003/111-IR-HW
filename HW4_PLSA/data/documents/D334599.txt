we want to let you know that based on recent studies the jury is still out on the reliability of crimini mushrooms as a source of vitamin b12 this area of nutritional research is controversial for three reasons 1 vitamin b12 is not always detected in mushrooms including crimini mushrooms 2 when vitamin b12 is detected in mushrooms it is usually found on the outermost portions of the mushrooms suggesting that bacteria on the mushroom surface may have been produced the vitamin b12 rather than the mushrooms themselves and 3 the chemical structure of vitamin b12 found on some mushrooms while based on the corrintype ring structure that is characteristic of vitamin b12 can have important differences from the form of vitamin b12 that provides us with full vitamin benefits we use one of the most uptodate and comprehensive nutrient databases to help us assess the nutrient composition of our whfoods and based on this data we rank crimini mushrooms as a good source of vitamin b12 and our only ranked nonanimal source of this vitamin and you may be getting an important vitamin b12 boost from consumption of crimini mushrooms however based on the research evidence we do not recommend that you rely on crimini mushrooms or other fungi as your primary source of b12 you may be able to make a difference in the health benefits you get from mushrooms by being extra careful with the temperature at which you store them in a study examining color and texture changes in crimini white button mushrooms over a six to eight day period storage temperature had a definite impact on color and by inference colorrelated phytonutrients including certain polyphenols as temperatures moved closer and closer to room temperature the researchers stopped at 59°f15°c in their study which is about ten degrees lower than room temperature as designated in most studies discoloration and hardening became more and more problematic researchers speculated that the lack of cell walls in fungi like crimini mushrooms and greater activity of oxidative enzymes like polyphenol oxidase at higher temperatures may have paved the way for this discoloration and implicit nutrient loss prevention of discoloration and hardening required the researchers to take the temperature down all the way to 38°f3°c over this six to eight day period since 38°f3°c is great temperature setting for your home refrigerator what were talking about here is careful refrigeration of mushrooms as soon as youve arrived back home from the grocery store at whfoods healthy sautéeing is our recommend method for cooking crimini mushrooms like all of our cooking methods we try to focus on the best possible results in terms of taste texture and minimal loss of nutrients in this context we were encouraged by a recent study that subjected crimini mushrooms to three different types of cooking methods microwaving for two minutes boiling for five minutes and stirfrying for two minutes results of this study showed a decrease in total antioxidant capacity following the microwaving and boiling approach and a slight increase in this capacity through use of the stirfry method the authors speculated that the microwaving and boiling methods allowed watersoluble antioxidants to leech into the cooking water while the stirfrying method which involved sunflower oil did not while we cannot be sure exactly what happened from a single and limited study the results here suggest that heating in oil may be a good way of ending up with some very tasty mushrooms and valuable antioxidant benefits antioxidant benefits from consumption of crimini mushrooms have recently been demonstrated in a smallscale study on middleaged adults diagnosed with metabolic syndrome over a period of four months participants in this study consumed approximately one cup of cooked sliced crimini white button mushrooms results of the study showed that the total antioxidant capacity in the bloodstream of the participants increased and that their level of oxidative stress as measured by the amount of carboxymethyllysine in their blood serum decreased in addition levels of ergothioneine—a sulfurcontaining and antioxidant amino acid—were found to double in the participants lab results while many people might not want to consume this amount of crimini mushrooms on a daily basis we suspect that less frequent consumption would also have resulted in important antioxidant benefits although probably not as extensive as the benefits demonstrated in this study whfoods recommendations at whfoods we include crimini mushrooms as one of our 38 profiled vegetables because these mushrooms are not only found in the produce section alongside of many vegetables but because most people have become accustomed to thinking about mushrooms as vegetables and to incorporating them alongside of vegetables in recipes strictly speaking however mushrooms are not considered vegetables because they are not considered to be plants instead they are members of their own special kingdom of living things called fungi we took a less strict and practical approach on our website when we decided to include crimini mushrooms as a featured vegetable and our crimini mushroom recommendations are based on this approach our whfoods optimal intake level for vegetables is 10 total servings per day many different vegetable subgroup combinations can be used to reach this 10serving total included are cruciferous vegetables allium vegetables like garlic and onions leguminous vegetables like green beans and green peas and of course mushrooms including crimini mushrooms in our worlds healthiest foods meal plan we include approximately one cup of crimini mushrooms for the week while we do not specify a minimum level of crimini mushrooms in our vegetable advisor or anywhere on our website we recommend inclusion of mushrooms in your total weekly vegetable servings based on their unique nutrient composition and equally

history how to select and store tips for preparing and cooking how to enjoy nutritional profile references health benefits antioxidant and antiinflammatory benefits from crimini mushrooms as the worlds most widely enjoyed mushroom varieties button mushrooms including crimini make what can only be described as an outstanding contribution to human nourishment and health highlighting the contribution of crimini are their antioxidant and antiinflammatory benefits as a fungus crimini mushrooms are unusual in their macronutrient content many foods provide us with proteins and carbohydrates but few foods provide us with the unique forms of these macronutrients that are found in crimini in the protein category perhaps the most unique protein component in crimini is the sulfurcontaining amino acid known as ergothioneine this amino acid is derived from the more common amino acid histidine and it has welldocumented antioxidant benefits in fact not only has ergothioneine been shown to function as an antioxidant but in animal studies it has also been shown to protect against chronic oxidative stress ergothioneine not only provides us with antioxidant support but with immune support as well since it helps protect immune cells from oxidative damage research studies have also confirmed the ability of our body to uptake ergothioneine following consumption of crimini mushrooms in the carbohydrate category crimini also provides us with unique nourishment here the research has focused on two type of polysaccharides the glucans especially betaglucan and the heterogalactans especially fucogalactan it is the antiinflammatory nature of these polysaccharides that has received the most research attention the glucans and heterogalactans in crimini are known to function in an antiinflammatory capacity by inhibiting the activity of enzymes like cyclooxygenase 2 cox2 they are also known to help reduce inflammatory cell signaling in addition the unique polysaccharides in crimini mushrooms can help to stimulate immune function especially within our digestive tract macrophages—the largersized white blood cells that are important for many types of immunity—have been shown to undergo increased activation following intake of crimini polysaccharides in addition one of our first lines of defense along the linings of our body cavities including our gi tract is the production of secretory immunoglobulin a sig a researchers have determined that sig a can be activated by intake of button mushrooms thanks to their polysaccharide content in human studies approximately one cup of blanched white button mushrooms per day over a period of three weeks has been shown to increase body levels of sig a so as you can see the proteins and carbs provided by crimini mushrooms go beyond the proteins and carbs found in most foods with respect to their antioxidant and antiinflammatory benefits in addition to the unique macronutrient composition of these mushrooms are three key minerals provided by crimini that provide us with antioxidant protection the first of these minerals is selenium which is required for proper functioning of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase crimini are an excellent source of selenium the other two minerals are manganese and zinc these minerals are required for proper functioning of the enzyme superoxide dismutase crimini mushroom are a very good source of both minerals broadbased nutrient support from crimini mushrooms in addition to the macronutrient benefits described earlier is the extensive micronutrient support that we get from crimini mushrooms this unique food is a ranked source of eight different vitamins and six different minerals in the excellent category you will find the minerals copper selenium and phosphorus as well as the vitamins b2 b3 and pantothenic acid in the very good category you will find the minerals potassium zinc and manganese together with vitamin b1 and in the good category you will find vitamin b6 vitamin b12 choline and folate what you are looking at in this list is a single 16calorie serving of a single food that provides good very good or excellent amounts of 50 of all micronutrients that we analyze on our website with respect to vitamin b12 however we do need to add one cautionary note throughout our website we use an uptodate and comprehensive nutrient database to help us assess the nutrient composition of our foods based on this data we rank crimini mushrooms as a good source of vitamin b12 in fact crimini mushrooms are our only ranked nonanimal source of this vitamin despite the database values for b12 however we believe that the jury is still out on the reliability of crimini mushrooms as a source of vitamin b12 for us this area of research involves three types of controversy first vitamin b12 is not always detected in mushrooms including crimini mushrooms second when b12 is detected in mushrooms it is usually found on the outermost portions of the mushrooms suggesting that bacteria on the mushroom surface may have been produced the vitamin b12 rather than the mushrooms themselves and third the chemical structure of vitamin b12 found on some mushrooms while based on the corrintype ring structure that is characteristic of vitamin b12 can have important differences from the form of b12 that provides us with full vitamin benefits you may be getting an important b12 boost from consumption of crimini mushrooms however you also might not be and based on the research evidence we do not recommend that you rely on crimini mushrooms or other fungi as your primary source of vitamin b12 in order to round out our description of the broadbased nutritional support provided by crimini mushrooms it is important to mention some additional phytonutrients provided by this unique food crimini provides us with numerous phenolic acids including gallic caffeic ferulic coumaric and protocetechuic acid it also provides us with lesser amounts of flavonoids and other polyphenols all of these phytonutrients have welldocumented antioxidant properties and they often have wellestablish antiinflammatory properties as well other likely health benefits from crimini mushrooms throughout our website we strive to provide you with health benefit information that is based on human studies involving large numbers of people who consume foods in an everyday way for the most part we simply do not have studies of this type to document the likely healthy benefits of crimini mushrooms for specific health problems for the most part healthbased research on crimini mushrooms has involved animal studies or lab analysis of purified extracts or purified components but we have seen many promising findings in these nonhuman studies and several smallscale human studies with encouraging outcomes as well animal and lab studies on crimini mushroom powders extracts and isolated components have focused on two general areas of health problems cardiovascular problems and progression of various cancer types in the cardiovascular category we have seen multiple studies in which consumption of mushroom extracts has improved blood fat levels especially levels of triglycerides in addition are a good number of studies showing blood vessel and blood cell protection from oxidation following intake of crimini mushroom powders and extracts these findings make good sense to us given the rich antioxidant content of this food in the area of cancer progression we have seen what researchers refer to antitumor activity following consumption of mushroom extracts by rats and mice particularly with respect to breast cancers however extracts from white button mushrooms have typically been analyzed in these studies rather than extracts from brown button crimini mushrooms in addition we have seen less consistent evidence in these white button mushroom studies than found in studies of other mushroom types—for example shiitake mushrooms still it makes sense to us for crimini mushrooms to help lower cancer risk since their antioxidant and antiinflammatory benefits are welldocumented and risk of many cancer types is increased by chronic unwanted oxidative stress and chronic undesirable inflammation in the category of smallscale human studies we were excited to see a recent study on intake of crimini mushrooms and metabolic syndrome middleaged participants in the study consumed approximately one cup of cooked sliced crimini white button mushrooms per day over a period of four months all participants in the study had been previously diagnosed with metabolic syndrome results of the study showed that the total antioxidant capacity in the bloodstream of the participants increased and that their level of oxidative stress as measured by the amount of carboxymethyllysine in their blood serum decreased in addition levels of ergothioneine a sulfurcontaining and antioxidant amino acid were found to double in the participants lab results while many people might not want to consume this amount of crimini mushrooms on a daily basis we suspect that less frequent consumption would also have resulted in important antioxidant benefits although probably not as extensive as the benefits demonstrated in this study description crimini mushrooms are known by a variety of names and sometimes these names can be confusing probably the most common generalized term that you will hear for crimini mushrooms is the term button mushrooms since the top portion or cap of these mushrooms is shaped like a hemisphere or rounded button however most people consider crimini mushrooms to be a special subgroup of button mushrooms and not synonymous with all button mushrooms most commonly the word crimini is used to designate a subgroup of the button mushrooms and it refers to button mushroom varieties that are somewhat smaller than most white button mushrooms more light browncoffeecocoa in color and somewhat firmer as well the crimini flavor is also typically more robust and distinct than the flavor of white button mushrooms we have heard the description meaty being used in this context so in terms of common usage crimini mushroom refers to the same food as brown button mushroom another name you might see for crimini mushroom is baby bella which is shorthand for baby portabella you might also see the word crimini being spelled as cremeni or the term baby bella being spelled as baby bello at whfoods we use the term crimini mushroom and brown button mushroom interchangeably and we are not referring to all button mushrooms include the familiar white versions when we talk about crimini mushrooms like all mushrooms crimini belong to the fungi kingdom of living things fungi are different in many biological ways than plants and we dont want to suggest otherwise on our website however since many people are accustomed to thinking about mushrooms as vegetables and often use mushrooms alongside of other vegetables when cooking we have included them among our 38 whfoods vegetables despite their proper status as a fungus the part of crimini mushrooms that we eat is called the fruiting body similar to the formation of fruits on plants the fruiting body we call a mushroom develops at a later stage in the fungus life cycle the issue of life cycle is important for understanding crimini mushrooms because a good deal of debate exists about the most natural way for mushrooms to be cultivated the life cycle of a crimini mushroom starts with a spore—the reproductive unit of this food that can be found on the underside or inner surface of the top portion or cap germination of a mushroom spore begins the mushrooms life cycle and germinated mushroom spores—technically known as mycelium—are referred to as spawn spawn can be thought of as the equivalent of seeds in a plant after producing spawn mushroom growers need some medium to serve as the food source that allows the spawn to continue developing into mushrooms this medium often involves some form of a composted grain—for example wheat pearl millet sorghum or dried paddy straw from a rice paddy these composted substances are typically referred to as the spawn bed and it makes sense to think about them as the soil for growing mushrooms its also worth noting that some mushroom growers use logs to grow the spawn and generally proceed by drilling holes in the logs inoculating wood dowels with spawn and then plugging the holes with the inoculated dowels unlike plants most mushrooms do not depend on sunlight for growth and can do well in a dark environment instead of breathing in carbon dioxide and breathing out oxygen like plants however mushrooms do the reverse and need a good supply of oxygencontaining air to thrive in addition to the many different media on which mushroom spawn can be grown there are many different ways of creating the spawn beds themselves these beds may be indoor or outdoor and may involve trays racks columns or mounds the many different options for creating a mushroom growth medium coupled with the many different options for setting up the overall growth facility have led to debates over the most productive least wasteful and most nutritious way to cultivate crimini mushrooms we have not seen any largescale research that shows one approach to be clearly superior to another however and we suspect that growers in different regions and habitats have good options for cultivation that are most suitable to those regions and habits and in general we think about crimini mushrooms as a very versatile life form since it can be found growing wild in many regions of the world and in fairly diverse habitats at the same time that we recognize the versatility of crimini mushrooms and the many different cultivation options described above we also believe that like any food the quality of a crimini mushroom depends on the quality of its seed and growth environment for example while we have not seen any largescale research studies in this regard we would predict that crimini mushrooms grown on composted materials that had previously been contaminated with residues of pesticides heavy metals or other unwanted substances would end up absorbing some of these contaminants into the brown button mushroom that we eat for this reason we recommend the purchase of purchase of certified organic mushrooms while there are no specific organic standards created exclusively for regulation of mushroom production all organic standards that have been set into place for other foods get applied to mushrooms as well so we are confident about your ability to lower your exposure to unwanted contaminants through the purchase of crimini mushrooms in certified organic form—unless of course you have another way to be sure about the quality of the mushroom growing environment for example you might know a local trusted mushroom grower in terms of their scientific classification crimini mushrooms belong to the agaricus bisporus genusspecies of fungi and within the fungi kingdom crimini mushrooms belong to the agaricaceae family of fungi in the basidiomycota division in this context we also want to note that white button mushrooms also belong to this same genusspecies of fungi history as a broad group button mushrooms are native to many regions of the world and can still be found growing wild worldwide however cultivation of button mushrooms also began far back in time in many regions of the world and especially in parts of china india and japan today china is the largest single producer of all mushrooms including not only crimini but other types with approximately 16 million metric tons of production the united states netherlands poland spain and france are also major mushroom producers but not at the high production level in china if all countries and all types of mushrooms are considered global production amounts to approximately 35 billion dollars each year in terms of trade and sales this largescale production and importexport of button mushrooms makes them the most widelyenjoyed mushroom varieties in the world and their popularity is reflected in their incorporation into many of the worlds regional cuisines within the u s over 500 million pounds of button mushrooms are produced each year including both brown and white button types in terms of sales volume the state of pennsylvania produces the most button mushrooms followed by the state of california one county in pennsylvania—chester county—is especially wellknown for its cultivation of button mushrooms how to select and store look for crimini mushrooms that are firm plump clean and light brown or coffee or cocoa in color those that are wrinkled or have wet slimy spots should be avoided if your recipe calls for caps only choose mushrooms that have short stems to avoid waste fresh and dried brown button mushrooms are typically available throughout the year at whfoods we encourage the purchase of certified organically grown foods and crimini mushrooms are no exception repeated research studies on organic foods as a group show that your likelihood of exposure to contaminants such as pesticides and heavy metals can be greatly reduced through the purchased of certified organic foods including crimini mushrooms in many cases you may be able to find a local organic grower who sells crimini mushroom but has not applied for formal organic certification either through the u s department of agriculture usda or through a state agency examples of states offering statecertified organic foods include california new york oregon vermont and washington however if you are shopping in a large supermarket your most reliable source of organically grown crimini mushrooms is very likely to be crimini mushrooms that display the usda organic logo the best way to store loose button mushrooms is to keep them in the refrigerator in a loosely closed paper bag wrapped in a damp cloth or laid out in a glass dish that is covered with a moist cloth whether you use a paper bag a damp cloth or a glass dish its worth avoiding all storage methods that leave the mushrooms stacked in one big clump the less surface contact they have with one another the fresher they will stay a great step to avoid clumping is to make a first layer of mushrooms inside your paper bag or on top of your damp cloth or glass dish and then cover this mushroom layer with a paper towel a second layer of mushrooms can then be placed on top of the paper towel these storage methods will help preserve the mushrooms moisture without causing them to become soggy and keep them fresh for several days once mushrooms have developed a slimy layer across their surface they are not longer fully fresh mushrooms that are purchased prepackaged can usually be stored in the refrigerator for 37 days however to maximize freshness we recommend removal from the original container and storage according to one of the methods described above also we recommend that you begin refrigeration of your mushrooms as soon as you have brought them back home from the supermarket dried mushrooms should be stored in a tightly sealed container in either the refrigerator or freezer where they will stay fresh for six months to one year tips for preparing and cooking tips for preparing mushrooms mushrooms are so porous that if they are exposed to too much water they will quickly absorb it and become soggy therefore the best way to clean mushrooms without sacrificing their texture and taste is to clean them using minimal if any water to do this simply wipe them with a slightly damp paper towel or kitchen cloth you could also use a mushroom brush available at most kitchenware stores if using the whole mushroom in a recipe simply slice off the very bottom of the stem which is usually a bit spongy if your recipe only calls for the caps gently break off the stems with your hands and discard or save for making soup stock the nutrientrich way of cooking crimini mushrooms we recommend healthy sautéeing crimini mushrooms we feel that this method also gives crimini mushrooms maximum flavor healthy sauté—similar to quick boiling and quick steaming our other recommended cooking methods—follows three basic cooking guidelines that are generally associated in food science research with improved nutrient retention these three guidelines are 1 minimal necessary heat exposure 2 minimal necessary cooking duration 3 minimal necessary food surface contact with cooking liquid heat 3 tbs of broth over medium heat in a stainless steel skillet when broth begins to steam add sliced mushrooms and healthy sauté for 7 minutes it is best to
