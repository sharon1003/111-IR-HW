industry within 60 years of clevelands founding industry especially the making of iron and its products began to dominate the economy of the city and its vicinity to a large degree clevelands growth has been determined by its industrial base the term industry in its economic and technical sense refers to the organized production of goods for the market historians also use the term industrialization to refer to the rapid increase in the size and number of industries in europe and north america over the last 300 years the u s was an early leader and cleveland a major center of industrialization modern industry is associated with the factory system of production in which workers are gathered in one place to work under centralized direction with the aid of powered machinery clevelands factories have usually massproduced standardized products such as clothing iron shapes or automobiles cleveland industry developed under favorable economic conditions primary among them was excellent transportation the development of shipping on the great lakes the completion of the ohio  erie canal in 1832 the later construction of railroads and the more recent construction of major highways and airports have allowed cleveland to receive a large flow of raw materials and to ship out finished products in addition exceptional businessmen and inventors have developed and promoted clevelands industry and the citys workers have been recognized for their skill and productivity in its first 4 decades cleveland was an agricultural village and a regional center of commerce examples of manufactured items included farming tools barrels for shipping salted meat flour and other food products and household furnishings these were made by craftsmen in small shops rather than in factories in 1820 for example a cleveland newspaper contained advertisements for a wagonmakers shop located near the courthouse on public square and a 2story shop containing a shoemaker and a saddlemaker with the coming of the canal clevelands markets expanded in 1837 the city was reported to have 4 iron foundries making steam engines and other products 3 soap and candle works 2 breweries a windowsash factory 2 ropewalks a pottery 2 carriagemakers 2 millstone shops and a large flour mill under construction the cuyahoga steam furnace co  just established was probably the largest single industry it had a blast furnace that made iron from ore charcoal and limestone brought by canal and had a foundry to make the iron into usable products over the next 40 years the company made a variety of goods which were representative of clevelands flourishing iron trade steam engines locomotives stoves and iron for building construction at the time of the u s manufacturing census of 1860 the most valuable industrial product of cleveland was iron while the manufacture of items made from iron was also very important like many other great lakes cities cleveland had a large flourandgristmilling industry ranking 2nd in value of product which served the productive midwest farms clevelands history from 18601930 was mostly a record of heavy industrialization not commerce in agricultural products the civil war gave immediate impetus to clevelands iron industry and by 1880 the making of iron and steel represented 20 of the value of the citys manufactures in part this growth was due to enterprising clevelanders who in the 1850s began exploiting the mineral resources of the upper great lakes and shipping the ores to cleveland leaders in the iron industry after the civil war included the otis iron  steel co and the cleveland rolling mill co in newburgh the latter began making bessemer steel in 1868 and otis instituted openhearth steel manufacture in 1873 both technologies were importations of recent european innovations along with some other cleveland companies otis and the cleveland rolling mill eventually joined the u s steel corp  formed in 1901 the making of machinery and other iron and steel products such as ore vessels for the great lakes trade continued to grow along with the production of iron and steel machinetool companies such as warner  swase y and cleveland twist drill made lathes planers drill presses and similar devices or parts for them sewingmachine manufacturers for example the white co and other machinery companies were major purchasers of machine tools in turn the cleveland clothing industry already the citys 3rdlargest producer of goods by value in 1860 became a major consumer of sewing machines this industrial interconnection iron and steel machine tools sewing machines clothing is one example of how growing industries benefited by linking to one another such interconnections were crucial to the development of clevelands industries another contribution to industrial growth in the later 1800s came in the form of entirely new industries the petroleumrefining industry developed rapidly after the first american oil well was drilled at titusville in northwestern pennsylvania in 1859 although cleveland was no better located with respect to the new oil region than pittsburgh or buffalo young cleveland businessman john d rockefeller became the most resourceful organizer of the oil market bringing oil to cleveland by railroad at low prices rockefeller built or purchased almost all of clevelands refining capacity in the 1870s and made the city the center of the american refining industry by exercising a virtual monopoly in the industry and attempting to control an enormous network of shipping refining and distributing enterprises rockefeller became a pioneer in modern corporate forms he experimented by establishing in cleveland the standard oil co of ohio 1870 and then the standard oil trust 1879 while rockefellers methods of business control were ruthless and his industrial combinations were eventually broken up by court action he was one of the first businessmen in the u s to recognize that rapid industrialization required new forms or organization clevelands chemical industry arose in part out of the refiners need for sulfuric acid the grasselli co of cincinnati established a cleveland works in 1866 specifically to supply sulfuric acid to refineries but in succeeding years it supplied a wide range of industrial chemicals relying in part on petroleum products for their raw materials cleveands large paint and varnish companies were founded in the 1870s henry sherwin and edward williams joined in 1870 to form a paintmanufacturing company  sherwinwilliams  and 10 years later they introduced a readymixed paint which found immediate success francis h glidden organized his company in 1875 and based its sales on varnishes and enamels electrical equipment was another new industry of the later 19th century although telegraphy had become the first viable electrical technology in the 1840s its power and apparatus requirements were low and did not stimulate major industrial development clevelander chas brush pioneered in new electrical technology in the 1870s by developing an effective dynamo to generate large amounts of electricity and an outdoor arclighting system to consume electricity first put into continuous use on public square in apr 1879 brushs dynamo and arc lights were soon installed in major cities throughout the world in 3 years they could be found in san francisco london and shanghai among others brush pushed his company into the production of batteries and streetcar equipment as well before it was absorbed by general electric in 1891 other electrical businesses were founded by persons trained in brushs company including national carbon co and lincoln electric while brushs personal influence continued to be felt at the brush laboratories the success of brushs business soon attracted numerous other firms to the electrical industry the automotive industry was the final major industry to emerge in cleveland the automobile was brought to a workable form by european inventors of the 1880s and early 1890s but when americans took to the horseless carriage after 1895 it was still not clear whether it would be gasoline electric or steampowered cleveland boasted 3 of the earliest manufacturers of each type alexander winton gasoline walter baker electric and rollin white and the white co steam a winton sold in 1898 is often claimed to be the first american automobile made for the open market the cleveland automobile manufacturers mostly specialized in highquality and luxury cars bakers electric vehicles for example were favored by wealthy women for quiet pollutionfree driving white specialized in heavy touring cars a tradition that served the company well when it decided to make only trucks other wellknown cleveland luxury cars included the stearns jordan and peerless in spite of having several hundred brands of automobiles made in cleveland up to the 1930s the city lost the leadership of the auto industry to detroit as early as 1910 henry ford whose vision of a car for the common man carried the day chose to concentrate his efforts in what became the motor city however cleveland remained one of the most important assembly and partsmanufacturing centers in the u s major automakers continued to build and operate new facilities in the cleveland area after the mid1900s several smaller industries arose in conjunction with automobile manufacture including diesel engines construction and industrial vehicles and aircraft parts clevelands industry came to the end of its period of rapid growth by 1930 cleveland was then second only to detroit among american cities in the percentage of its workers employed in industry this dependence affected society in a variety of ways the public schools for example provided industrial training for their pupils and in 1930 the citys industrial development committee reported that industrial training could be found in all school grades moreover thousands of workers were enrolled in the public schools adulteducation classes trade and industrial unions were also a means of accommodating industrialization the city early acquired a reputation for strong trade and craft unions which joined workers of similar skills to maintain or improve wages and working conditions in the 1930s cleveland workers were also receptive to the formation of industrial unions especially the united steelworkers and the united auto workers which crossed over trade or craft lines a sitdown strike at the general motors fisher body plant on coit rd in 1936 was a catalytic event in unionizing the automobile industry the consistent training of clevelands workers and the unionization of important industrial sectors made the city attractive both to jobseekers and to businessmen and did much to promote clevelands industrial growth in 1931 the u s census of the cleveland metropolitan area including cuyahoga and lorain counties ranked it 8th nationally by the number of industrial employees and 7th by value of its products this ranking held essentially the same through the economic depression of the following decade and through the ensuing war years during world war ii manufacturers and workers strained the citys productive capacity cleveland twist drills outstanding record earned it the first armynavy star award in the nation several cleveland firms including harshaw chemical victoreen instrument brush beryllium mc gean chemical and h k ferguson contributed materially to the manhattan atomic bomb project nevertheless the concentration of cleveland industry on producers goods such as machine tools or construction equipment which made it a wartime arsenal also made it especially susceptible to economic fluctuations measured by national averages cleveland workers suffered more during depressions and recessions but did better in times of economic growth clevelands industry entered the 1950s with its boom years in the past and no obvious directions for change the census of 1954 indicated that its traditional leading industries were essentially in the same positions as before the great depression in terms of employment and value of products the cleveland areas leaders were transportation equipment 1st 1st machinery 2nd 2nd ironandsteel making 3rd 3rd metal products 4th 4th and electrical machinery 5th 6th during the next 3 decades these industries remained the leaders though their rank order varied and accounted for more than 60 of the citys industrial employment by the 1980s some sources of future change were visible most notably the international iron and steel market was adverse to american industry as a whole and cleveland in particular the impact was symbolized by the dismantling of the u s steel blast furnaces in cleveland and severe fluctuations in production levels at republic steel the jones  laughlin corp  and other iron and steel companies in the late 1970s clevelands decline in manufacturing was led by its basic steel motor vehicle and equipment and metalworking industries with aging facilities mismanagement and outside ownership among the reasons for their departure challenges from japanese and european automakers and drastic increases in gasoline prices changed american automobile buyers habits and required shutdowns or retooling of many cleveland plants by 1986 bluecollar employment represented only 29 of the total employment in cuyahoga lake medina and geauga counties few new industries seemed likely to take a major role in cleveland soon although the making of instruments and medical equipment grew significantly during the postworld war ii years and the manufacture of chemicals and plastics and the printing and publishing business remained strong as cleveland looked to the future organized research seemed likely to assume a major role in new industrial development from the establishment of the national electric lamp assn laboratories at nela park 1911 and the national carbon industrial research facility at about the same time cleveland business supported research leading to new technologies later the federal governments lewis laboratory 1941 and the facilities of case institute of technology became important sites for pioneering development by the mid1980s the cleveland area had over 200 corporate industrial research laboratories while cleveland became a major american industrial center during the century after 1830 dependence on an industrial economy has brought periods of high unemployment and air and water pollution among other problems nevertheless cleveland area industry appeared to be stabilizing in the 1980s with numerous new small manufacturing companies forming and major employers such as ford motor general motors and ltv steel making substantial investments in their existing facilities darwin h stapleton rockefeller archive center see also aerospace industry brewing industry electrical and electronics industry
