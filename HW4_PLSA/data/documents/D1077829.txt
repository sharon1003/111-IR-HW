news aer lingus has bailed out of the oneworld alliance as a result of it becoming a nofrills carrier aer lingus strategy has changed fundamentally since it joined the alliance six years ago and is no longer convergent with oneworlds full service strategy aer lingus is the national airline of ireland quality on aerlingus has plunged of late and around europe it is little more than one of the smaller low cost carrier all onboard frills and business class have been axed long haul it is a little better and air fungus  as many have now christened the airline  can still just about hold its own transatlantic based in dublin it operates over 30 aircraft serving europe asia and the united states the airline is owned by the irish government under whose guide it became a moribund carrier that was just a few steps from total bancrupcy in 2001 the airline even stopped all services for a number of weeks while it tried to work out financial deals allowing it to stay aloft a number of radical cost cutting measures have seen the airline axe anything which doesnt make a profit and a large number of staff it adopted the slogan low fares way better it then axed prety much all on board service plans are now being made for the privatisation of the company aer lingus has lost its membership of the oneworld alliance which it uses to mop up some transatlantic feeder traffic because it doesnt provide services that many passengers on codeshares would expect effectively the airline runs two services  long haul ferrying american tourists to dublin and shorthaul taking residents of eire to bucket and spade destinations shannon aer lingus airbus a320 on the stand before takeoff to lhraer lingus classes seats and fleet all shorthaul flights are one class only nofrills buy on board long haul there is still some limited service but forget having a free bar unless you are in business class seats  entertainment are definately early 1990s style the aer lingus fleet is now solely populated by airbus planes and indeed almost shows a catalogue of how the manufacturer would like airlines to use its planes with lots of short haul routes having the 320 type and 330s on longhaul transatlantic aer lingus are believed to be in discussions with airbus and boeing to replace their older airbus a330 fleet with either the airbus a350 or the boeing 777 and the as yet to fly boeing

which 3 airbus are a330200 and 4 are airbus a330300 two further a320200 options have been converted to orders due later this year not particularly tidy they all feature décor which will make your brain ache economy seats have material which is decorated in eye popping material with writing that coverers sayings about ireland all this on either an emerald green or beige background the aer lingus cabin will never win any awards either for its colour style or features the 300s have 36 premier with 279 economy and are used to new york  newark boston and chicago while the 200s have 24 premier with 251 economy and are used to los angeles new york newark boston and chicago premier seat on an aer lingus airbus a330business class or premier is of course up the front  where it should be all of aer lingus a330s are two class planes but the front cabin varies  rows 1 to 4 or 1 to 6 on the 300s are business class business class seats feature airbus typical cradle seat from the 1990s featuring a 50 pitch there arent even adjustable headrests on these seats its ok but it only reclines half way making a decent night flights sleep very difficult all the seats are also in leather making a night flight a sticky squeeky affair seats are in a 222 format economy is very much that  seats come in a 242 layout its got a 31 pitch and not the slightest sign of any frills there is no at seat power row 31 is an exit as is row 12 at the front of the economy cabin a separate much smaller cabin with 3 more rows rows 9 to 11 before the curtain and business many seasoned travellers prefer this smaller cabin economy seat on an aer lingus airbus a330there is marginally less engine noise it is much more cosy and will have a lot less passenger traffic going through it and a proportion more attention from the cabin crew row 9 in particular gets a lot more legroom thanks to the divider with business aerlingus airbus a320a321there are 21 airbus a320200 in the fleet there are 6 airbus a321200 all are one class planes  the dividing curtain between business and economy having been removed when this class was scrapped shorthaul dusseldorf aer lingus airbus a320 pushing back economy seats are in the classic 33 pattern in the a321 row 10 is the emergency exit with lots of legroom  beware of row 9 though with has an odd seat in the middle of the row with no view of the window on the righthand side of the aircraft de  fyou sit opposite a member of the cabin crew on the a320 rows 12 and 13 get the emergency exit with more legroom aer lingus onboard inflight experience dont expect too much  or indeed anything  from traveling on aer lingus it is strictly a way to get there and not a fun thing to do reviews and opinions are generally pretty poor when it comes to aer lingus if only because of the ryanairisation of the airline all short haul has moved into the realm of a nofrills carrier and as such you get nothing other a trolley that at crusing altitude starts at the front and rolls back trying to sell you stuff for long haul in economy you will get a very basic meal service and paid for drinks on the long haul services that stop at shannon there is nothing at all  not even a free glass of water  from dublin long haul in business things are better however the crew are noticably inattentive and hang around in the galley there are usually preflight drinks after you board however there is no sparkling wine on early morning depatures there is then a newspaper trolley the crew will come round hand out cold towels and take your meal requests but there are normally no menus the food is then pretty much unceremonially dumped in front of you and you are left to get on with it aer lingus economy headphones aer lingus inflight entertainment whether you get a seatback tv on an aerlingus longhaul flight depends on the model of plane you are on on intercontinenal flights using a330 aircraft the entertainment system is a lottery  you could either get a system that goes back to the 60s with a projection screen at the front of the aircraft or you could get lucky and get a fairly modern seatback multichannel tv even in economy on transeurope flights on the a320 aircraft there is no entertainment other than looking out of the window if you end up in an older a330 or one that hasnt been retrofitted with seatback tvs you will get a large projection screen at the front of the cabin and smaller crt screens at intervals along the cabin ceiling there are armrest controls which mean you can change the radio channel or listen to the tv but thats it with the a330 onescreen aircraft called mainstream tv there will be two films the first is shown shortly after takeoff and the second about ten minutes afterwards there are also 8 audio channels a330 overhead screens a few a330s currently two however aer lingus are retrofitting some aircraft have seatback tvs in economy and business class with 9 channels  there are 5 film channels 2 channels with short tv programmes and a kids channel you can also play games on the seatback tvs these are very basic with games like hangman backgammon and black jack a330 entertainment control in the armrest on both types of aircraft the headphones are very basic with airbuses normal overhead band type and a single 35mm jack plug radio and tv channels are in mono aer lingus inflight magazine  cara cara the inflight magazine this is pretty good it comes out every 2 months or so there are the usual travel articles to destinations aer lingus serves there is also a nice departures section with events happening on aer lingus routes and a good section on cultural events at destinations divided into eat  drink sleep style and in review this section was revamped quite recently and its one of the few parts of aer lingus thats pretty modern and up to date the movie guide at the back  if you have an a330 with overhead video screens look at the mainstream tv screen selection otherwise the multi channel tv selection is in the shorter listings at the bottom of the page the last page of the magazine has the sky cafe menu read cara the inflight magazine online  aerlingus routes news dublin to salzburg have started aer lingus has also announced their first scheduled service to asia to dubai in the united arab emirates dublin is very much the hub of operations dublin to londons heathrow airport remains a core route however to maintain compatibility with the other short haul routes it too has been turned into a nofrills route oddly this leaves bmi as the only 2 class carrier between the dublin and lhr ba fly to lgw  a rather pointed difference as bmi has become a nofrills carrier on all other routes there are a few flights which fly out of cork  although there are no links from here to dublin the only domestic route is from dublin to shannon which is actually populated by transatlantic planes stopping off at shannon before going over the pond this gives large areas of scarcely populated areas of rural island direct access to transatlantic services alas it adds an extra hour and lots of hassle to these flights aer lingus eire  uk routes from london lhr there are 12 flights a day to dublin at 0650 0750 0905 1005 1105 1235 1410 1515 1620 1745 1845 1945 and 2045 all on a321s shannon has 3 flights a day at 1010 1510 and 1945 while cork has 4 daily flights at 0955

three flights stop off at shannon on their way over the pond the 0815 the 1130 and the 1400 all a330s stop off there for 45 minutes to pick up passengers you can buy tickets for this short hop although only in economy from dublin the main route is to new york jfk having a330s at 1030 1130 1345 and 1600 boston has a direct service at 1130 or via shannon at 1515 chicago ohare has a sole daily

lingus business class lounges  the gold circle club aer lingus now operate only one type of lounge the gold circle club the premier lounges have been shut down london lhr aer lingus gold circle lounge aer lingus gold circle club lounge london heathrow lounges terminal 1 domestic pier 4a beside gate 86 open daily 05302200 despite only operating a nofrills service to dublin from lhr aer lingus very suprisingly still have a dedicated lounge at the airport  in the domestic arm flights from the uk to ireland count as domestic flights for complex political reasons the premier part of the lounge has recently been shut down the lounge is pretty dreadful  compared with the great ba lounge which you can access through one world access procedures however the ba lounge is in the main part of the terminal  a good 20 minutes walk from the aer lingus lounge which is right by the gate note that once you are at the aer lingus lounge you then cant get back to the ba lounge london lhr aer lingus gold circle lounge bar the main lounge has fairly stiff 1960s style chrome and plastic armchairs and some much stiffer airport lounge style chairs again in black leather and chrome the three circular chairs around the glass table are a lot more comfortable there is also a long wooden dining table with even if thats possible stiffer chairs this all compares with the stiff lounge dragons who are some of the snottiest at heathrow below the video screen all of one giving departure information is the newspaper rack  with one copy only of each of some of the main uk papers the ft the times and the irish independent all of which have stickers saying that they cant be removed from the lounge at this point you notice that pretty much everything in the lounge has a sticker for lounge use only even the coffee mugs there is a business centre with five desks right by the rear fire door and smoking lounge alas there are no computers loos are outside the lounge there is one tv in the main body of the lounge surrounded by the worst chairs london lhr aer lingus gold circle lounge london lhr aer lingus gold circle lounge bar food is pretty bad  there are 3 types of cake slices in plastic 1 type of biscuits and packets of fruit and nut mix the bar by contrast is limited but actually ok there are 2 racks of 4 optics with the usual vodka and whiskey there is a deep fridge well in the worktop in which there are 2 types of white wine a chardonnay and a sav blanc and 1 red on the worktop beside it there are racks of min cans of coke tonic etc on the worktop but better is the fridge which has the same cans chilled in the fridge are the obligatory cans of guinness with logoed pint glasses on the shelf above there are no windows outside this very soulless lounge and all in all its a waste of time its much better to kick your heels in the ba lounge until your flight is called aer lingus dublin business class gold circle lounge departure pier b at far end left via lift before the bar then to the end of the rotunda dublin aer lingus gold circle lounge well done if you ever find this lounge  there are no signs anywhere in the airport to its location it is cunningly hidden away and even the airport staff seem mystified as to its location which is odd as its aer lingus rather shameful flagship lounge for its transatlantic operations head down pier b through the duty free shop then when you get to a fake irish pub on your left double back on yourself and summon the lift press the button for the corporate lounges here walk through what seems like an abandoned hotel lobby left at the fork for the eagle lounge now abandoned and walk around the circle until you get to the sign on the blank door saying premier lounge  closed go through the door this is where the gold circle lounge is dublin aer lingus gold circle lounge bar there are three main parts to the lounge there is the main area where you enter which has a long wooden dining table overlooked by the lounge dragons there is a bar here and the food counter to the left is a small area with a tv and a hertz rent a car computer to the right is a much bigger area with another bar closed and unstaffed throughout the entire lounge there are great views over the airport apron food isnt great there are cake slices in plastic and packets of fruit and nut mix however in a bowl on the worktop there are lots of chocolate bars which are fantastic along with cheese and biscuits and two flavours of pretzels dublin aer lingus gold circle lounge bar the bar is however very good having racks of optics there is a deep fridge well in the worktop in which there are 2 types of white wine merlot 2003 and chardonnay 2005 from the fleur du cap south african collection and 1 red on the worktop beside it dublin aer lingus gold circle lounge there are racks of mini cans of coke tonic etc on the worktop but better is the fridge which has the same cans chilled in the fridge are the obligatory cans of guinness with logoed pint glasses on the shelf above aer lingus shannon lounge after departure lounge past the bar on the left shannon aer lingus gold circle lounge this is a pretty grim lounge but if you are flying on fungus to the us one that youll probably spend most time at all thanks to us flights stopping off at shannon for preflight clearance of your passport the louonge can be found airside stuck after the fake but of course real irish pub in the middle of the consourse there are no windows but a couple of skylights do allow in some daylight often there are no lounge dragons on guard so access is available for all once you go through the rather blank shannon aer lingus lounge bardoor there is one central room with a small bar then at the far end a sort of sit down bar with some workstations but no computers food is non existant there are packets of nut mix but thats about it the bar equally limited there are two optics one with vodka and the other with a whisky and a gin one lone bottle of red is on the worktop and one bottle of white is in the fridge along with mini cans of coke and tonic in the fridge are the obligatory cans of guinness and large cans of bud  heiniken aer lingus history the name aer lingus is an anglicisation of the irish form aer loingeas which means air fleet when founded in 1936 the airline opened its first service between dublin and bristol using a sixseater de havilland biplane in 1940 a new airport was completed in the dublin suburb of collinstown and aer lingus moved their operations to the new aviation centre apart from a new dc3 service to liverpool and an internal service to shannon the airlines services were curtailed during world war ii shannon aer lingus lounge workstations in 1945 services were resumed with flights to london aer lingus had exclusive traffic rights in exchange for a 40 holding by boac  bea in the 1950s aer lingus started new routes to brussels amsterdam  rome in 1960 it started flying to new york with 707s and in 1966 the route from shannon to montreal and onward to chicago began by 1968 it began flights from belfast to new york but these were soon suspended due to the beginning of the troubles london lhr aer lingus a321the airlines worst disaster occurred in 1968 when a vickers viscount aircraft en route from cork to london crashed near tuskar rock in the waters off the south east coast of ireland all 57 passengers and four crew perished the crash is generally known as the tuskar rock air disaster the cause of the crash is still unknown with some highly debateable reports suggesting that british missile tests were to blame in 1970 aer lingus took delivery of three boeing 747s however one was promply leased out when the airline worked out it was not profitable for the company to fly 747s across the atlantic on a frequent basis 1974 saw a new livery of two different colours of blue and one green and the word international disappeared from the fuselage titles on aer lingus planes in 1994 aer lingus started direct services between dublin and the united states using the new airbus a330 this led to the phasing out of the boeing 747 the late 1990s saw aer lingus return to belfast with a service to new york via shannon newark was also added briefly added before these flights were suspended in 2001 aer lingus business was severely reduced due to attacks on the us the airline has now bounced back largelythrough a new strategy involving lowering the airlines cost base updating the fleet with modern airbus equipment and developing new routes to mainland european destinations it is now positioning it as direct rival to nofrills airlines like ryanair both short haul and for intercontinental flights there are no meals perks or even business class on anything other than long haul flights and the trademark aquamarine uniforms are to be dropped in favour of casual poloneck shirts aer lingus hints  tips operational upgrades one of the common questions is how do i get an upgrade on aer lingus to business or club class alas getting upgraded to business class on aer lingus really isnt that easy the airline has the western rather than american model for upgrades longhaul which is to say youll only get an upgrade if your paid for class is full and then upgrades are processed accordingly to a pecking order of elite frequent flyer status you are very unlikely to ever get an upgrade unless you are at least a gold circle prestige member to start with make sure you are a frequent flyer and you do fly frequently after all if aer lingus are going to upgrade anyone they will upgrade those passengers who fly with them pretty regularly and hence will enjoy the upgrade enough to put more business aer linguss way then if the flight is full in economy and someone needs to be moved up the check in staff will look at gold circle prestige members another thing that aer lingus look at is how much you paid for your ticket its much more likely to happen with a full fare ticket although occasionally you can get lucky with a discounted economy ticket on aer lingus the airline has heard  probably hundreds of times a day  requests for an upgrade the general consensus seems to be that if you ask for an upgrade youre more likely to get it although opinions differ on an upgrade strategy for aer lingus as always my advice on dressing properly in the pages on how to get an upgrade applies aer lingus website the aer lingus website is pretty basic but it does the job of letting you book a flight and tells you some limitted information on the company main website wwwaerlinguscom seatmaps cara the inflight magazine aer lingus food aer lingus is a very much a low cost airline when it comes to food for flights around europe there is a menu at the back of the inflight magazine and you get what you pay for transatlantic there is limited free food there is no service at all on the sole domestic flight from dublin to shannon hot ham and cheese panini a panini sandwich which is toasted it contains one layer of ham between two layers of cheese this certainly does the job  particularly if all the early morning full english breakfasts have gone you need to order it from the trolley  it is then taken to the galley and heated for you although if you last to be served on the plane youll only have about five minutes to eat it before the plane lands €500chicken  pesto wrap a light flowery pancake type wrap which has been sliced in two it contains diced chicken with mayo mixed with pesto this isnt great  if only because all it contains is just lots of diced chicken mixed up with a little mayo in a pesto sauce all in all it looks like something youd get in a cheap filling station it tastes like it too €500savoury snack pack one slab of cheddar one triangle of soft processed cheese one packet of two jacobs crackers one packet of cheese biscuits on the inflight menu card this looks great  with lots of cheese and biscuits when you get it its a real disapointment there is very little content and in reality you could buy this lot for about 50 cents in tesco €300aer lingus drinks if you are in economy  its going to cost you even transatlantic aer lingus like to charge for their beer along with wine and spirits in business class long haul its all free white wine woodbridge sauvignon blanc pretty decent  although you pay for it from the usual stable of woodbridge winesin california this is crisp and lively woodbridge sauvignon blanc displays vibrant citrus pear and tropical fruit character with hints of mineral and lemongrass135 €450red wine woodbridge zinfandel red great deep and dark rich velvety layers of ripe black cherry wild berry and peppery spice unfold in our woodbridge zinfandel and end in a velvety finish barrel aging lends mature flavors and integrates warm vanilla tones with the expressive zinfandel character14 €450sparkling wine nicolas feuillatte sparkling wine great sparkling wine this is a very good sparkling wine and its a delight to find it on a plane even the bottle says quality with a true foil top the content is light and very fizzy with an elegant and well balanced floral nose a delicate blend of 20 chardonnay 40 pinot noir and 40 pinot meunier it comes from a vineyard near chouilly close to epernay12 €12beer beer comes in just one variety too  heineken its the usual tame stuff you get on the ground in a 330ml tin 4€350note that all reviews and opinions on aer lingus ei food service seats planes upgrades lounges the gold circle club and the frequent flyer scheme is soley at my judgement no legal liability is accepted if you take my advice drag this link onto your home button to make this your home page
