antivirus program on their computer learn about the signs symptoms and other information about this nasty virus what is the google installer virus google is the company that claims their motto is “don’t be evil however the google installer virus otherwise known as the google updateexe or later as the google redirect virus and the google chrome virus has certainly performed a lot of evil on computers while google itself did not make promote or spread the virus some users believed the company did because many google update and installer files showed an error upon opening the chrome browser and google updateexe were particularly affected because every time a user with this infection would attempt to install or use the browser it would close it would display an error message stating that google installer encountered an error and needed to close these were the words that made users believe google distributed the virus the writers of the virus disguised its signature to appear as google files which is how they probably remained on some peoples systems for so long the underlying trojanrootkit called “rtkttdss bb primarily makes up the virus and allows it to wreak havoc on a computer known by various names depending on which antivirus or antimalware program is used this particular infection was first discovered in the beginning of august 2008 the underlying trojanrootkit has a low infection rate but a dangerously high damage rate and continues to infect computers worldwide what does the google installer virus do some of the more common names for this virus when detected by various security programs include rtkttdss bb trend micro backdoor tidserv hacktool rootkit symantec trojrootkitfm sophos trrootkit gen avira trojan win32 tdssuqa kaspersky backdoor w32tdss fsecure and others this infection creates its own registry keys as well as most infections do and include the following hkcusoftwaremicrosoftwindowscurrent versionrun

random valuedatsystemtdss random valuedl this installer virus also attempts to access the internet creating a backdoor in the spoolsvexe process which can be found in the task manager of windowsbased computers with a printer installed the infection injects the malicious code into this process thus granting the infection access to the internet after this process is completed the infection will attempt to connect to websites where a bot is ready to deploy more malware to the users computer by this point the infection is firmly rooted and very difficult to remove installer virus symptoms the google installer virus is a very damaging infection if left unchecked like all trojans and rootkits this one can steal personal information stop your internet from working and crash your computer as well not to mention infect all other computers that may be on the local network some of the specific actions that the underlying trojanrootkit are known for include browser takeover which redirects address bar entries to advertising pages and malware infected websites and excessive popups of the same advertisements additionally the chrome browser eventually crashes with the error message stating “google installerexe has encountered a problem and needs to close with recurrences of the message every few minutes this is why the infection received the name “google installer virus inability of the user to visit security advice blogs forums or websites and the users inability to download any files even if files are downloadable they are corrupted meaning the user is either unable to run them or execution of the files causes the browser or computer to hang or crash this is especially true of antivirus and antimalware programs additionally any security program already installed on the computer may not open and if it does hangs until the process must be ended with the task manager the installer virus is not limited to these specific activities they are simply some of the most common actions taken by the google virus however if any of these symptoms appear the computer with these symptoms probably has the google installer infection and the user should perform an infection removal immediately to prevent any further damage google virus removal now comes the fun part after symptoms appear or if the user’s current antivirus solution recognizes the installer virus signatures as a detected threat the user should remove the threat as soon as possible simply quarantining the threat and deleting it might work however because this infection is coupled with a rootkit it is more than likely that the removal of the infection simply removes the trojan not the rootkit if this happens the rootkit will download reinstall the infection and continue to cause havoc using a removal tool such as malwarebytes or symantec’s removal tool may do the trick if using either of these tools or any other security program of choice be sure to rename the files so the infection does not “know’ that it is a security program to do this when the “save dialogue box appears for malwarebytes simply change the file name from “mbamsetupexe and the symantec removal tool from “fix tdssexe to “boohooexe or a similar name follow the prompts to install and run the programs and then again to delete the detected threats if these tools do not work manual infection removal may be the only option basic protection the google installer virus has created massive frustration to computer users everywhere while the threat of infection is minimal once a user is infected the harm that can come from it is immense the best way to prevent this — or any — infection is to always keep antivirus and antimalware up to date additionally because of the complicated nature of many viruses of late a simple antivirus may not detect all types of threats using a security program made especially for detecting rootkits spyware viruses trojans and more is recommended for the most comprehensive protection
