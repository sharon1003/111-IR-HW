references8 external links81 official links82 additional links theme  editalthough the details of the backstory vary from park to park all follow the same general story arcs some time in the late 1800s gold was discovered on big thunder mountain in the american southwest overnight a small mining town became a thriving one the name of the town varies from ride to ride in the california ride the town is known as rainbow ridge in the florida version the town is known as tumbleweed and in paris the town is known as thunder mesa mining was prosperous and an extensive line of mine trains was set up to transport the ore unknown to the settlers the mountain was a sacred spot to local native americans and was cursed 1before long the settlers desecration of the mountain caused a great tragedy which depending on the park is usually depicted to be an earthquake in the paris and california versions of the ride a tsunami in the tokyo version of the ride a flash flood in the florida version of the ride which befell the mines and town and the town was abandoned a man was wandering around and boarded an already moving car interested he was known to be quite bold and hung on tight as the train went very fast and he had a wild ride when he finished he had many handfuls of gold and proudly left with his riches some time later the locomotives were found to be racing around the mountain on their own without engineers or a crew the big thunder mountain railroad was founded in the old mining camp to allow wanderers to take rides on the possessed trains inspired by reallife bryce canyon the hoodoos of big thunder in disneyland as seen from the big thunder trail that passes behind the ride the detailed backstory while present in park literature and training materials is not communicated to park guests directly the station buildings on all four versions of the ride are themed to appearance of a mining company office from the mid to late 19th century in the disneyland ca park there is music and laughing in one of the saloons and a typewriter is heard from a newspaper office the mountains themselves are themed to the red rock formations of the american southwest the rock work designs in the california version are based on the hoodoos of bryce canyon national park in utah in the florida tokyo and paris versions of the ride the rockwork designs are based on the rising buttes that are located in utah and arizona s monument valley special care was taken by the imagineers to make it appear that the rocks were there originally and the track was built around the rocks unlike a number of earlier mine rides which were built the other way around by sculpting the rocks around the tracks there is also a dinosaur skeleton that the train passes by built into the side of the mountain a cracked eggshell is nearby and there is a pleasant lake with water that is shot up while the train passes on the warmer days 2 sound effects of a typical locomotive operation are piped into the surrounding scenery to add realism to guests viewing the ride from observation platforms including the steam whistle sounding even though there is no whistle displayed on the locomotives history  editbig thunder mountain railroad was designed by imagineer tony baxter and ride design engineer bill watkins the concept came from baxters work on fellow imagineer marc davis s concept for the western river expedition a westernthemed pavilion at the magic kingdom designed to look like an enormous plateau and contain many rides including a runaway mine train roller coaster however because the pavilion as a whole was deemed too expensive in light of the 1973 construction and opening of pirates of the caribbean baxter proposed severing the mine train and building it as a separate attraction the big thunder mountain railroad project was put on hold again in 1974 as resources and personnel were being diverted to work on constructing space mountain in tomorrowland but this delay may have ultimately produced a smoother ride as the use of computers in attraction design was just beginning when the project was resumed big thunder mountain railroad was one of the first disney rides to utilize computeraided design 2 the attraction first opened at disneyland in 1979 and the magic kingdoms larger version in florida opened in 1980 tokyo disneylands version opened in 1987 and disneyland paris opened with its version in 1992 the paris versions layout and structure were mostly based on the florida version of the ride but with several significant differences the revised european ride takes the form of a large island in the center of the rivers of the far west accessed from its riverside station by tunnels underneath the water the attraction in disneyland paris is the only big thunder mountain to have been an openingday attraction at its park hong kong disneyland does not have a big thunder mountain railroad attraction or a westernthemed frontierland for that matter however grizzly gulch has a theme similar to frontierland the main attraction big grizzly mountain runaway mine cars carries a similar theme to big thunder mountain railroad timeline

track similar to the space mountain refurbishment new trains new scenery and new effects  citation neededtributes to predecessor  editat disneyland big thunder mountain railroad was built on the land the mine train through natures wonderland used to occupy several tributes to the former attraction are present in the disneyland version a scaleddown western town sits adjacent to the queuing lines and tracks near the station a western saloon hotel assayers office and mercantile appear among the buildings this is the village of rainbow ridge which used to overlook the loading platform of the sedate mine train through natures wonderland many of the animal animatronics throughout the attraction are animatronic animals from the previous attraction other allusions to the mine train through natures wonderland include the rainbow caverns glowing pools of water by the first lift hill and precariously balanced rocks in the third lift hill tunnel the name of the ride itself big thunder was originally the name of a large waterfall the old mine train passed on its tour little thunder was located nearby name  editat the magic kingdom and at disneyland the ride is known by its full name of big thunder mountain railroad the tokyo and paris versions would drop the word railroad in favor of the name big thunder mountain tokyo disneylands big thunder which is almost identical to the magic kingdoms opened in 1987 five years after the park opened at magic kingdom and disneyland the name of the ride is sometimes shortened to big thunder mountain thunder mountain railroad thunder mountain or even just thunder kidney stones  editin the october 2016 journal of the american osteopathic association a paper entitled validation of a functional pyelocalyceal renal model for the evaluation of renal calculi passage while riding a roller coaster was published 3 the papers author dr wartinger found that patients of his had passed kidney stones after riding big thunder mountain railroad at walt disney world on vacation including one who passed three stones on three separate occasions the doctor then tested this result with the permission of disney with a 3d model of a kidney by riding the ride over 20 times the study found nearly 70 of the time the kidney stone was passed with results varying depending on which row they were in 3 4 the study also found that the space mountain and rock n roller coaster starring aerosmith failed to cause this result 5ride experience  editdisneyland version  editbig thunder mountain railroad at disneyland while the design of the walt disney world version of this roller coaster was done first disneylands version was the first one to open 6 the track layout was mirrored placing the attraction to the right of rivers of america if viewed from the central hub in walt disney world the attraction is located to the left of rivers of america to better fit with the adjacent fantasyland areas of the theme park the original walt disney world design had to be replaced with something more appropriate for disneyland the florida tokyo and paris versions of the ride use sharpedged mountains and the vibrant colors of monument valley arizona while disneylands version was developed with more rounded features and muted colors resembling the bryce canyon hoodoos in utah 7upon entering the attraction the queue winds through a narrow rock wall and passing by the tracks the surrounding walls were originally created from 100 tons of gold ore from rosamond 8leaving the outdoor station trains enter a batinfested tunnel make a right hand turn then a left hand turn before climbing the first lift hill which takes trains through a cavern full of stalactites leaving the lift hill the train drops away to the right then levels out and makes a left hand turn the track then crosses under the second lift hill drop before making a right hand turn the sounds of coyotes can be heard howling at the train as it dives into an underground cave at the end of the tunnel the train hits a trim brake exits the tunnel and climbs the second lift hill at the top of the lift an animatronic goat bleats at passing guests as the train drops away to the right crosses under the lift hill and rises up into a downward spiraling clockwise helix leaving the helix the train shoots through a small canyon then drops down into a mining camp where it hits another trim brake the train then makes a left hand turn enters another tunnel and climbs the third lift hill as the train climbs the lift the tunnel is dynamited and artificial smoke is blasted in guests faces as the train crests the lift and exits the tunnel the train then drops to the right towards the river then makes a right hand turn and passes through a short tunnel after crossing over the drop the trains make a left hand turn as they pass through the ribcage of a trex skeleton hit a trim brake then make a right hand turn into the final brakes the train then travels by the buildings of rainbow ridge as it returns to the station californias version of the ride is the only version of the ride to feature an outdoor station all of the other versions feature an indoor station on january 7 2013 the ride was closed for an extensive refurbishment that included a new track trains scenery and new effects on the third lift hill the attraction reopened on march 17 2014 9 the new track was fabricated by dynamic structures the company that had previously rehauled the coaster track in space mountain 10magic kingdom version  editbig thunder mountain railroad at the magic kingdom for the most part the track layout of the magic kingdoms version is a mirror image of the disneyland version riders board the trains in an enclosed loading station on a hillside leaving the station trains make a left hand turn into a batinfested tunnel make a slight right turn and climb the first lift hill at the top of the lift hill trains pass under a waterfall and drop to the left this is followed by a right hand turn after which the track crosses under the second lift hill and drop after crossing under the second lift hill drop the track goes through a 270 degree clockwise spiral and passes through a short tunnel trains emerge from the tunnel and pass through the flooded town of tumbleweed the train passes over a decaying trestle where the track is slightly banked from side to side before entering davy jones mine where it hits a trim brake trains then make a left hand turn and climb the second lift hill at the top of the second lift hill trains drop to the left and cross under the lift hill before rising into a 540 degree downhill counterclockwise helix passing over a broken trestle leaving the helix trains shoot up across a small hill make a slight right turn then drop through another tunnel and hit a trim brake the trains then make a right hand turn into a tunnel and climb the third lift hill as the train climbs the lift an earthquake hits and makes the train cars sway from side to side the effect achieved by slightly banking the track leaving the lift trains emerge from the tunnel crest a small rise and drop to the left towards the rivers of america after traveling along a short section of straight track the ride then makes a left hand turn through a short tunnel and crosses a short bridge the train then makes a right hand turn and passes through the ribcage of a trex skeleton as it hits the final trim brake makes a left hand turn past some geysers and hot springs and rises into the final brakes the train then coasts back to the station the florida version was allocated more space in the park and so the monument valleyinspired ride structure assumes 25 acres 25 percent larger than the disneyland version 11tokyo disneyland version  editbig thunder mountain at tokyo disneyland big thunder mountain at tokyo disneyland is similar to the florida ride but there are some differences in the ride layout instead of tumbleweed the track makes a left turn and dives into an underground cave mirroring the california version of the ride more significantly the final segment of the ride is different instead of crossing back over the drop from the third lift hill the track makes a 180 degree turn to the right before dropping out of a tunnel through the boneyardgeyser scene into a short tunnel the track then makes a right hand turn into the final brakes the trains pass in front of the station building and then turn back into the loading area disneyland paris version  editbig thunder mountain at disneyland paris while primarily based on the florida version pariss version is unique as it is situated on an island in the middle of the rivers of the far west where tom sawyers island would normally sit it is also the only version of the ride to be an opening day attraction the paris version underwent a year long refurbishment from november 2015 to december 2016 as part of the renovation the track was overhauled some of the scenery was repainted and a few elements from the california version were added rainbow pools of water on the first lift hill cave new sound effects for the mine elevator on the second lift hill new mapping effects for the blasting scene on the third lift hill interactive games were also installed in the queue 12guests board the trains at a station on the mainland immediately upon leaving the station trains dive into a tunnel that transports them under the rivers of the far west to the island where the ride is located the train makes a right hand turn and makes a quick steep rise before starting up the first lift hill as trains climb out of the darkness of the underwater tunnel stalactites and stalagmites can be seen growing next to the track along with several rainbow colored pools of water the sounds of bats swooping up above can also be heard during warmer months a waterfall parts around the track at the top of the hill trains pop out of the tunnel leave the lift hill and drop around a left hand turn pass through a small cave then make a swooping right turn if the trains are being dispatched timely when the train goes through this curve it will appear to make a near miss with a train in the 540 degree helix after this turn the trains pass under the second lift hill and its drop making a slight hop before making a left hand turn onto a trestle the train runs along the rivers of the far west across the water from phantom manor then makes a slight right hand turn and suddenly falls through a washed out section of the trestle the trestle drop also contains an onride camera after dropping down to the water level with water jets on the sides of the track simulating a splashdown the trains go around a left turn and hit the base of the second lift hill as trains start up the lift hill two tied down donkeys can be seen to the right side of the track braying at passing trains with an empty watering pail in front of them a goat can be seen pulling on a shirt hanging on a clothesline to the riders left as the trains pass a parked steamroller and mine elevator and travel under a water tower at the top of the lift it is possible for guests to catch a glimpse of the twilight zone tower of terror at walt disney studios paris on the horizon before the trains drop around a left turn and cross back under the lift hill coming out of the drop the track goes over another rise and passes a sign warning of a broken trestle mounted to the water tower post cresting the hill trains cross over the broken trestle and spiral down through a 540degree counterclockwise helix exiting the helix the trains pass through a short cave and go over a quick airtime hill as they shoot down a canyon as the trains drop through the tunnel and pass over a trim brake a loud gust of wind is heard trains then make a right hand turn on another trestle enter a tunnel with signs warning of blasting over the portal and climb the third lift hill as the train starts up the third hill the tunnel is dynamited and artificial smoke is blasted in guests faces as the train crests the lift and exits the tunnel the train crests a small hill then drops to the left onto a straightaway alongside the river speeding up as it enters the return tunnel the train encounters a swarm of bats in the tunnel as it makes another sharp counterclockwise turnaround and goes down a steep drop to cross under the water the trains continue to accelerate through the dark until it pops out of the exit portal on the mainland the train then coasts past the station through the loading dock and then turns around to reenter the station in other media  editin film  editthe sounds of disneylands big thunder mountain railroad trains were recorded and used as sound effects for the mine cart chase sequence in steven spielberg and george lucas  1984 film indiana jones and the temple of doom 13 disneyland would later get its own indiana jones attraction in 1995 and the walt disney company would go on to acquire the indiana jones
