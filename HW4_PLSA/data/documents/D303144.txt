scientists have been surprised by the discovery that magnesium plays an essential role in supporting brain plasticity which is the sign of a youthful flexible brain primed for optimal learning memory and cognitive function 1the good news is that raising brain magnesium levels has been proven to restore critical brain plasticity and improve cognitive function 1 in a justpublished landmark human study researchers showed that they could reverse brain aging by as much as nine to 14 years in magnesium supplemented people 2scientists at the massachusetts institute of technology mit found a novel way of overcoming the problem of getting magnesium loaded into the brain due to poor absorption 1these researchers tested a unique compound called magnesiumlthreonate and found it boosted brain magnesium levels by an approximate 15 1when comparing various forms of magnesium they found that magnesiumlthreonate had the highest bioavailability and brain magnesiumloading ability as a result studies show that magnesiumlthreonate improves brain plasticity leading to direct and significant improvements in memory learning and cognition 3the foundation of learning and memory the human brain is capable of forming new connections between neurons when we take in new information an electrochemical signal is sent across the space between neurons called the synaptic space this ability of the brain to form new connections or neural pathways to communicate with each other is often referred to as brain plasticity think of it as the ability to learn a new skill like a dance move our brains generate new neural pathways or “wires” to master the particular skill on the contrary when these “wires” become faulty or deteriorate memories start fading and individuals can forget simple things like names or phone numbers brain plasticity is now understood to be the very foundation of learning and memory 4 this means that changes in memory including the formation of new memories and learning of new concepts requires changes in those synaptic connections hence the term plasticity as you are reading this article your brain is forming and reforming new neural connections with aging we lose brain plasticity which results in a loss of cognitive function 5 that’s why a young person with an active flexible brain easily latches on to new ideas and simply thinks faster than an older person whose brain has lost plasticity and is more fixed in its patterns as recently as a decade ago scientists thought that loss of vital brain plasticity was inevitable due to age but they were wrong recent studies have shown that increasing brain magnesium levels can reverse deteriorating brain plasticity the result is considerable restoration of cognitive function both in healthy adults and in those with neurodegenerative diseases 168what you need to know magnesium improves brain plasticity brain plasticity the ability to remodel connections between brain cells is the physical foundation of memory and cognition loss of memory and cognitive function in old age and in neurodegenerative diseases is the result of lost brain plasticity studies show that raising brain magnesium levels restores lost plasticity and improves cognitive function in aging animals and in models of neurodegenerative diseases but conventional magnesium supplements fail to significantly raise brain magnesium levels a novel form of magnesium magnesiumlthreonate has been developed which is capable of rapid absorption and superior delivery to brain tissue raising brain magnesium levels by up to 15 animal studies reveal marked and significant improvements in memory learning and cognition with magnesiumlthreonate supplementation and lab studies show corresponding improvements in synaptic structures that correlate with improved brain plasticity new human data shows promising results in older adults with cognitive impairment after supplementing with magnesiumlthreonate regular supplementation with magnesiumlthreonate is essential for anyone concerned about agerelated loss of cognitive function or neurodegenerative diseases the magnesium connection magnesium is absolutely critical for maintaining healthy brain plasticity this is because magnesium regulates how brain cells form those critical connections that are the foundation of learning and memory in fact magnesium ions control tiny electrical switches technically “ion channels” in brain cells 9 the more signals that these electrical switches transmit the stronger the connections between cells and the stronger the formation of the resulting memory thus magnesium concentrations are an essential part of brain plasticitythe ability to add remove or revise celltocell connections to regulate learning and memory numerous studies demonstrate the dangerous impact of insufficient magnesium on brain health910 lab studies show us that depriving brain cells of sufficient magnesium impairs their ability to participate in optimal plasticity 1011 in animals and humans we are now able to see that this loss of plasticity leads directly to a poorer performance on tests of memory 1213the reason memory is impacted is because low levels of magnesium create decreases in the strengthening of connections between brain cells that lead to memory formation 10in addition to impacting memory chronically low calcium and magnesium levels in the diet have also been shown to correlate with a high incidence of neurodegenerative diseases 14basic lab studies have shown that boosting magnesium concentrations at excitatory synapses can enhance brain plasticity 15 in brain cells cultured from the hippocampus the part of the brain where we store and retrieve memories these changes led to more permanent enhancements of brain plasticity demonstrating longlasting improvement 15 it is important to note that the levels of magnesium needed to improve plasticity are well within the normal physiological range not exceedingly high studies in diabetic rats provide further support for magnesium’s ability to reverse losses in brain plasticity and restore cognitive function 11like diabetic humans these rats have a high risk of developing alzheimer’s disease researchers found that elevating brain magnesium levels with injected magnesium protected learning and memory in diabetic rats with spontaneous alzheimer’slike symptoms elevating brain magnesium levels also reversed impairments in synaptic function and longterm potentiation the cellular equivalent of learning11these studies make it clear that elevating brain levels of magnesium helps to improve cognition by improving plasticity the ability to make connections between brain cells and longterm potentiation the strengthening of those connections but one of the biggest challenges that researchers have encountered is delivering sufficient amounts of magnesium into the brain fortunately scientists at the massachusetts institute of technology mit have found a solution a breakthrough form of magnesium scientists at mit set out to find a betterabsorbed form of magnesium that also could boost concentrations of the mineral in the brain1 after testing numerous compounds they found what they were looking for in a unique compound called magnesiumlthreonate this is a complex of magnesium along with threonic acid a breakdown product of vitamin c 116figure 1 shows the dramatic results of treating rats with magnesiumlthreonate mg t compared with untreated control animals and with those supplemented with two other forms of magnesium1 only magnesiumlthreonate proved capable of significantly raising magnesium levels in spinal fluid which is a measure of brain magnesium magnesiumlthreonate’s effects were even more remarkable on short and longterm memory performance in live rats figure 2 compared with the other forms of magnesium the animals that were supplemented with magnesiumlthreonate demonstrated significantly greater memory retention over 10 minutes and 12 hours refer to figure 2 charts on next page 1in addition to short and longterm memory improvements rats supplemented with magnesiumlthreonate demonstrated enhanced learning abilities and enhanced working memory which are essential for normal cognitive function 1and in aged rats supplemented animals were better at pattern completion ability to retrieve memories based on incomplete information compared with control animals 1microscopic examination of brain tissue explained the reason for these dramatic improvements as expected the rats supplemented with magnesiumlthreonate had higher densities of synaptic proteins associated with memory formation especially in the hippocampus these findings correlated with the animals’ improved memory performance on testing 1in addition the magnesium increased the number of release sites at the presynaptic nerve endings but reduced their overall probability of releasing neurotransmitters this reconfiguration enabled synapses to more finely tune their transmissions resulting in greater plasticity the synapses were in effect “trained” to respond only to the “right” stimuli producing improved memories in the live animals 1finally the increase in brain magnesium levels enhanced longterm potentiation which is the process that refers to the strengthening of connections between brain cells based on recent patterns of activity that is associated with enhanced learning and memory 110new findings for posttraumatic stress disorder while alzheimer’s is the most urgent demonstration of restoration of brain plasticity by magnesiumlthreonate it is far from the only potential application for this supplement researchers also found that magnesiumlthreonate has beneficial effects for those suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd 6sometimes when our brains form connections they aren’t good ones for example certain objects or events linked with a previous danger triggers fear memories in healthy people these fear memories fade in time as the object triggering them is experienced in a safe environment perhaps this is the likely scientific explanation for the phrase “time heals all wounds”for example if you experienced a house fire hearing fire engines could reproduce the feelings of fear experienced from the fire itself in time that feeling will fade when the triggering event is experienced in a safe environment unfortunately in people who suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder that fear response does not fade with time this is likely due to the fact that posttraumatic stress disorder induces a sharp reduction in brain plasticity 2124exciting research has demonstrated that magnesiumlthreonate can help speed up this recovery process in people suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder scientists studied magnesiumlthreonate in rats with conditioned fear responses the animal equivalent of posttraumatic stress disorder amazingly the magnesiumlthreonate treatment helped the fear memory fade with time without impacting the original memory 625research shows that magnesiumlthreonate enhances brain plasticity in specific regions of the brain most affected by traumatic events 6 because of these dramatic results scientists are suggesting that magnesium could be a novel supplement for those suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder anxiety or depression 625what is magnesium magnesium the fourth most abundant mineral in the body is known to be a cofactor for more than 300 reactions catalyzed by enzymes including those essential for energy release from food and conversion to cellular work through formation of adenosine triphosphate or atp in mitochondria magnesium is also required for the synthesis of dna and rna 27magnesium is especially important in all of our bodies’ electrical and electrochemical activities including muscle contractions heart rhythm nerve conduction and brain cell activity 27the most common disturbance of magnesium in our bodies is hypomagnesemia or low blood magnesium levels which is widely recognized as a cause of seizures hypertension stroke migraine headaches attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and metabolic conditions such as insulin resistance and type ii diabetes 27in addition to all of these known functions magnesium has been found to be the controlling and essential factor in regulating synaptic plasticity in the brain which is the physical process that underlies what we perceive as learning and memory 1recent human study a remarkable human study on magnesiumlthreonate was released late in 2015 with compelling results that corroborate and extend all of the previous laboratory findings 2men and women aged 50 to 70 who reported cognitive problems eg memory and concentration were enrolled in the study they were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or a supplement containing magnesiumlthreonate subjects took 15 grams per day of the supplement if they weighed less than 154 pounds and 2 grams per day if they weighed more subjects were evaluated before starting the supplement and again at weeks six and 12 end of the study at each evaluation subjects participated in a series of tests of cognitive function while blood and urine tests were performed to calculate total body magnesium status 2by 12 weeks lab results showed that magnesiumlthreonate was effective at loading magnesium into the body as well as into cells red blood cells were used because it is impossible to safely sample brain cells in humans 2this form of magnesium was shown to be effective at loading magnesium into the brain and at enhancing brain function this was made clear by results of cognitive testing already by week six supplemented subjects demonstrated significantly increased speed in tests of executive function eg reasoning problemsolving and planning by week 12 that increased speed reached an approximate 20 improvement over baseline while placebo recipients experienced no significant change2there was also a significant 131 improvement in supplemented subjects’ working memory the memory we use for example to remember where we put things and a significant 376 improvement in episodic memory for example the ability to put new faces and names together and composite scores of overall cognitive ability rose significantly from baseline and compared with placebo at both weeks six and 12 2tellingly magnesium loading into red blood cells was significantly correlated with enhancement in overall cognitive ability in supplemented patients this was a strong validation of earlier animal studies in which raising brain magnesium levels boosted cognitive function 1an unexpected benefit was also demonstrated when the researchers examined fluctuations in cognitive performance over time such a fluctuation is known to be an early sign of impending cognitive impairment 226 not only did supplemented patients experience less cognitive fluctuation but the changes that they did experience were primarily positive performing better than usual all of these data provide impressive support for the use of magnesiumlthreonate to improve cognitive function but the real shocker comes with an analysis of this study’s subjects in the context of normal brain aging the researchers compared results of their study with data from a second study of cognitively normal subjects they determined that cognitive performance fell about 104 per year in the cognitive normal subjects researchers established that baseline performance in the first study was about 10 lower than that of agematched controls but after 12 weeks of supplementation the average increase in performance was 103 essentially restoring performance to that of agematched people without cognitive decline 2a still more remarkable finding became evident when researchers used the normal cognition study to assign a “brain age” to each of their own study subjects using this calculation for example a 50yearold with a 10 worse performance on cognitive testing would have a brain age equivalent to that of a cognitively normal 60yearold approximately 1 function loss per year 2using that calculation the researchers found that even though the average chronological age of subjects who completed their study was 578 years their average brain age at baseline was 683 years but by 12 weeks the brain age of the supplemented subjects had fallen by an average of 94 years while that of placebo recipients fell by less than a year 2in other words supplementation with magnesiumlthreonate resulted in an effective reversal of brain age to near normal the brain age reversal in subjects who had significant increases in red blood cell magnesium was still higher at 146 years moving those individuals into a brain age in fact younger than their actual age in yearssummary the loss of brain plasticity is at the heart of agerelated loss of cognitive function as our brains lose flexibility we lose the ability to learn new concepts to make sharp judgments and to develop new skills loss of brain plasticity is implicated in both the “natural” loss of brain function with aging and with accelerated cognitive decline as seen in alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases restoring brain plasticity has become a major focus of neuroscientists aiming to slow or eliminate the loss of brain function over time studies show that boosting brain magnesium levels dramatically renews the ability of brain cells and in animals to form new memories and discriminate between existing ones but conventional magnesium supplements are inadequately delivered to brain tissue challenging our ability to effectively raise brain magnesium levels the development of magnesiumlthreonate appears to have shattered that barrier studies show that this compound enters brain tissue more effectively than other magnesium preparations and is significantly more effective at restoring memory functions and brain plasticity in numerous animal models including those of alzheimer’s disease recent new human data on magnesiumlthreonate shows promising results in older adults with cognitive impairment those interested in preventing cognitive decline and in restoring active flexible brains should consider daily supplementation with magnesiumlthreonate no other magnesium preparation comes close to its
