ask casey large eggs vs extra large eggs jun 16 2010 · by casey barber i was planning on making one of the barefoot contessa’s recipes the other night when i noticed she called for three extra large eggs instead of three large eggs i didn’t have any extra large on hand—what is the difference and should i be buying two sizes of eggs for my recipes the short version is no you shouldn’t be bothered with keeping two different sizes of eggs in your fridge unless you’re a baking maniac or a rabid ina garten fan large eggs are the baking standard measuring about 2 oz by weight extra large eggs weigh in at 225 oz by comparison barely anyone but the barefoot contessa who apparently has a major jones for the xl size i have cooked probably one of her recipes in my lifetime so i trust you readers to back me up on this specifically calls for extra large eggs in their recipes pastry geniuses dorie greenspan gale gand johnny iuzzini and the incomparable david lebovitz all specify the large size in their recipes as david explained to me “in restaurants large eggs are the norm at least where i’ve worked so many recipes tend toward large eggs”any volume issues caused by that additional quarter ounce found in an extra large egg really only come into play when baking and even then pretty much only when the recipe calls for a lot of eggs subbing in a large for an extra large egg or vice versa in a recipe that only calls for a solo egg won’t make much of a difference however if you’re looking at a recipe for angel food cake pot de crème or another dessert that depends mainly on eggs for flavor and structure and which calls for five or more eggs then you can either stick to the recipe as written or make a slight adjustment based on the size eggs you’ve got in your fridge think of it this way cracking 4 extra large eggs into a bowl gives you nearly the volume equivalent of 5 large eggs by weight both will be hovering around 10 oz so the recipe substitution would break down as5 large eggs 10 oz  4 extra large eggs 9 oz  2 tbsp water 6 large eggs 12 oz  5 extra large eggs 1125 oz  35 tbsp water 7 large eggs 14 oz  6 extra large eggs 135 oz  1 tbsp water 8 large eggs 16 oz  7 extra large eggs 1575 oz  12 tbsp water 9 large eggs 18 oz  8 extra large eggs 18 oz and so on but let’s not get carried away with this substitution business while a dozen jumbos could make for some deliciously oversized deviled eggs or superduper omelets i’d stick to buying whatever you’re used to unless you’re a conversion genius who has figured out how save a few pennies by subbing in fewer jumbo eggs for their largesized counterparts the bottom line is that it matters a whole lot less whether you’re using large or extra large eggs than you think again listen to david lebovitz “for me it’s more like what’s available or what people will likely have on hand” so stop fretting put down the calculator and start baking stumped by the difference between caramel and butterscotch sauces wondering why a sane person would ever need a potato ricer or a mushroom brush i think about these things so you don’t have to send your questions to ask casey at casey atgoodfoodstoriescom ask casey pantry basicsbaking david lebovitz dessert eggs pastry substitution
