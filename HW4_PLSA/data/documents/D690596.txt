productivity18 tricks to make new habits stick scott h young wouldn’t it be nice to have everything run on autopilot chores exercise eating healthy and getting your work done just happening automatically unless they manage to invent robot servants all your work isn’t going to disappear overnight but if you program behaviors as new habits you can take out the struggle with a small amount of initial discipline you can create a new habit that requires little effort to maintain here are some tips for creating new habits and making them stick1 commit to thirty days – three to four weeks is all the time you need to make a habit automatic if you can make it through the initial conditioning phase it becomes much easier to sustain a month is a good block of time to commit to a change since it easily fits in your calendar2 make it daily – consistency is critical if you want to make a habit stick if you want to start exercising go to the gym every day for your first thirty days going a couple times a week will make it harder to form the habit activities you do once every few days are trickier to lock in as habits3 start simple – don’t try to completely change your life in one day it is easy to get overmotivated and take on too much if you wanted to study two hours a day first make the habit to go for thirty minutes and build on that4 remind yourself – around two weeks into your commitment it can be easy to forget place reminders to execute your habit each day or you might miss a few days if you miss time it defeats the purpose of setting a habit to begin with5 stay consistent – the more consistent your habit the easier it will be to stick if you want to start exercising try going at the same time to the same place for your thirty days when cues like time of day place and circumstances are the same in each case it is easier to stick6 get a buddy – find someone who will go along with you and keep you motivated if you feel like quitting7 form a trigger – a trigger is a ritual you use right before executing your habit if you wanted to wake up earlier this could mean waking up in exactly the same way each morning if you wanted to quit smoking you could practice snapping your fingers each time you felt the urge to pick up a cigarette8 replace lost needs – if you are giving up something in your habit make sure you are adequately replacing any needs you’ve lost if watching television gave you a way to relax you could take up meditation or reading as a way to replace that same need9 be imperfect – don’t expect all your attempts to change habits to be successful immediately it took me four independent tries before i started exercising regularly now i love it try your best but expect a few bumps along the way10 use “but” – a prominent habit changing therapist once told me this great technique for changing bad thought patterns when you start to think negative thoughts use the word “but” to interrupt it “i’m no good at this but if i work at it i might get better later”11 remove temptation – restructure your environment so it won’t tempt you in the first thirty days remove junk food from your house cancel your cable subscription throw out the cigarettes so you won’t need to struggle with willpower later12 associate with role models – spend more time with people who model the habits you want to mirror a recent study found that having an obese friend indicated you were more likely to become fat you become what you spend time around13 run it as an experiment – withhold judgment until after a month has past and use it as an experiment in behavior experiments can’t fail they just have different results so it will give you a different perspective on changing your habit14 swish – a technique from nlp visualize yourself performing the bad habit next visualize yourself pushing aside the bad habit and performing an alternative finally end that sequence with an image of yourself in a highly positive state see yourself picking up the cigarette see yourself putting it down and snapping your fingers finally visualize yourself running and breathing free do it a few times until you automatically go through the pattern before executing the old habit15 write it down – a piece of paper with a resolution on it isn’t that important writing that resolution is writing makes your ideas more clear and focuses you on your end result16 know the benefits – familiarize yourself with the benefits of making a change get books that show the benefits of regular exercise notice any changes in energy levels after you take on a new diet imagine getting better grades after improving your study habits17 know the pain – you should also be aware of the consequences exposing yourself to realistic information about the downsides
