place where drinks and or a meal would be included would be preferred but not a must we are going to be in port in july 2016 on the ncl breakaway and would like to use resort facilities instead of hanging at public beaches any ideas thank youraj bermudaattractionscom february 2016hi coco reef resort on elbow beach paget offers day passes that includes 2course lunch  a glass of wine plus beach towel to enjoy their private beach 69 per person for age over 12 elbow beach hotel offers day pass to enjoy their private beach it includes one umbrella two beach chairs and towels 75 note that the
