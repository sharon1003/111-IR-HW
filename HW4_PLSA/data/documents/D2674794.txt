who is zadara and what does it mean by a virtual private storage array we reckon its a bit like a vm for servers by chris mellor 7 aug 2014 at 0845 share ▼analysis storage upstart zadara supplies a vpsa a virtual private storage array to managed and cloud service providers what is a vpsa it is a 4u rackmount node containing dual x86 controllers and three types of storage media 200gb ssds 600gb 10k rpm sas drives and 72k rpm sata drives storing up to to 5tb each there are 36 drive slots 24 in the front and 12 in the back and it’s possible to have allflash vpsas if you wish maximum capacity with 5tb drives is 180tb these nodes scale out into effectively clustered resources using dual 10gbit e links and more than 200node configurations are possible there are four basic configurations baby  base cache 1gbits iobasic  double cache 2gbits ioboost  quad cache 4gbits ioblazing  octuple cache 8gbits ioa cluster can have nodes storage engines with different cpus and storage configurations older ones use quadcore xeons with newer ones using 6 and 8core ones zadara vpsa hardware that’s zadaras underlying hardware the real interest lies in the software however which is described as a virtualising storage resource abstraction layer zadara’s operating system let’s call it zos for short takes this aggregated set of nodes as its base platform and carves it up as virtual arrays for each user or tenant in a multitenant environment each virtual array is thus specific to a tenant or user hence private hence vpsa and can present itself as an i sci block resource or nfs or cifs smb file resource or both file and block each vpsa can be given a defined amount of cpu resource memory storage capacity in one or more of the three tiers and a protection policy such as raid 1 or 10 meaning a minimum of two nodes or raid 5 or 6 with a minimum of three nodes other protection capabilities include snapshots highavailability and disaster recovery are both present data can be encrypted inflight and at rest data is tiered with auto migration thats nondisruptive and ssd readwrite caching ssd cache is automatically added to every volume unless explicitly turned off by the user and the ssd cache size is selectable in real time by the user it can grow or shrink with no disruption any one vpsa can be scaled up in these respects or scaled down ondemand in real time  you can see why cloud service providers would like this and billing is on a payasyouuse basis  you can see why customers anxious to avoid capital expenditure on storage arrays might like this opexminimising idea a vpsa gets a defined quality of storage service qo s and the zos software prevents it going beyond that thus solving the “noisy neighbour” problem where one storage resourceaccessing client hogs too much resource and impoverishes the other array users in terms of storage qo s a vpsa is a virtual storage machine we think that in many ways this is conceptually equivalent to a server virtual machine net app has a roughly similar idea of virtual storage arrays or machines based on its fas arrays via ontap the hardware is built by zadara while the software which uses open stack code for orchestration and management has also been produced by zadara this is not just a business model we can view the zadara array as a hybrid array comparable to those from nimble tegile and tintri however their collective idea is to provide something like 90 per cent of flash data access speed for disklike costs zadara came from a different point of view wanting to offer cloud economics and cloudstyle consumption models we might think that the vmax cloud edition is a roughly similar system we understand that zadara has 25 employees there are more than 100 customers and it has had three consecutive quarters of doubled revenues quarteronquarter it was founded in february 2011 and toshiba has invested more than any other investor there was a 7m around and a toshiba 3m additional round which doesnt have a letter total funding is around 20m there is no deduplication or compression available today in zadaras products vaai support is coming personally id think the addition of object storage access is another possibility – perhaps using open stack software id also wonder about infini band or the faster 40gbits ethernet being supported in the future ®sponsored learn how to transform your data into a strategic asset for your business by using the cloud to accelerate innovation with net app tips and corrections post a comment sign up to our newsletter get it in your inbox daily
