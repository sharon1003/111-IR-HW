pulmonary embolism not what youre looking for start new search about causes diagnosis treatmentwhat is a pulmonary embolism a pulmonary embolism pe is a blood clot that develops in a blood vessel in the body often in the leg it then travels to a lung artery where it suddenly blocks blood flow a blood clot that forms in a blood vessel in one area of the body breaks off and travels to another area of the body in the blood is called an embolus an embolus can lodge itself in a blood vessel this can block the blood supply to a particular organ this blockage of a blood vessel by an embolus is called an embolism the heart arteries capillaries and veins make up the bodys circulatory system blood is pumped with great force from the heart into the arteries from there blood flows into the capillaries tiny blood vessels in the tissues blood returns to the heart through the veins as it moves through the veins back to the heart blood flow slows sometimes this slower blood flow may lead to clot formation what causes a pulmonary embolism blood clotting is a normal process to prevent bleeding the body makes blood clots and then breaks them down under certain circumstances the body may be unable to break down a clot this may result in a serious health problem when blood clots in a vein it may be due to the slowed blood flow an abnormality in clot forming or from an injury to the blood vessel wall blood clots can form in arteries and veins clots formed in veins are called venous clots veins of the legs can be superficial veins close to the surface of the skin or deep veins located near the bone and surrounded by muscle venous clots most often happen in the deep veins of the legs this is called deep vein thrombosis dvt once a clot has formed in the deep veins of the leg there is a potential for part of the clot to break off and travel through the blood to another area of the body often the lung dvt is the most common cause of a pulmonary embolism other less frequent sources of pulmonary embolism are a fat embolus often linked to the breaking of a large bone amniotic fluid embolus air bubbles and a deep vein thrombosis in the upper body clots may also form on the end of an indwelling intravenous iv catheter break off and travel to the lungs who is at risk for a pulmonary embolism risk factors for pulmonary embolism include genetic conditions that increase the risk of blood clot formation family history of blood clotting disorders surgery or injury especially to the legs or orthopedic surgery situations in which mobility is limited such as extended bed rest flying or riding long distances or paralysis previous history of clots older age cancer and cancer therapy certain medical conditions such as heart failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd high blood pressure stroke and inflammatory bowel disease certain medicines such birth control pills and estrogen replacement therapy during and after pregnancy including after cesarean section obesity enlarged veins in the legs varicose veinscigarette smoking what are the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism the following are the most common symptoms for pulmonary embolism pe however each person may experience symptoms differently sudden shortness of breath most commonchest pain usually worse with breathinga feeling of anxiety a feeling of dizziness lightheadedness or fainting irregular heartbeat palpitations heart racingcoughing andor coughing up blood sweating low blood pressure you may also have symptoms of deep vein thrombosis dvt such as pain in the affected leg may happen only when standing or walkingswelling in the leg soreness tenderness redness andor warmth in the leg sredness andor discolored skin if your healthcare provider thinks you have a pe he or she will check your legs for signs of deep vein thrombosis the type and extent of symptoms of a pe will depend on the size of the embolism and whether you have heart andor lung problems the symptoms of a pe may look like other medical conditions or problems always talk with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis how is pulmonary embolism diagnosed pulmonary embolism pe is often difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of pe are a lot like those of many other conditions and diseases along with a complete medical history and physical exam tests used to look for a pe may include chest xray this imaging test is used to assess the lungs and heart chest xrays show information about the size shape contour and anatomic location of the heart lungs bronchi large breathing tubes aorta and pulmonary arteries and mediastinum area in the middle of the chest separating the lungs ventilationperfusion scan vq scan for this nuclear radiology test a small amount of a radioactive substance is used to help examine the lungs a ventilation scan evaluates ventilation or the movement of air into and out of the bronchi and bronchioles a perfusion scan evaluates blood flow within the lungs pulmonary angiogram this xray image of the blood vessels is used to evaluate various conditions such as aneurysm bulging of a blood vessel stenosis narrowing of a blood vessel or blockages a dye contrast is injected through a thin flexible tube placed in an artery this dye makes the blood vessels show up on xray computed tomography ct or cat scan this is an imaging test that uses xrays and a computer to make detailed images of the body a ct scan shows details of the bones muscles fat and organs ct with contrast enhances the image of the blood vessels in the lungs contrast is a dyelike substance injected into a vein that causes the organ or tissue under study to show up more clearly on the scan magnetic resonance imaging mri this imaging test uses a combination of a magnetic field radiofrequencies and a computer to make detailed images of organs and structures within the body duplex ultrasound us this type of vascular ultrasound is done to assess blood flow and the structure of the blood vessels in the legs blood clots from the legs often dislodge and travel into the lung us uses highfrequency sound waves and a computer to create images of blood vessels tissues and organs lab tests blood tests are used to check the bloods clotting status including a test called ddimer level other blood work may include testing for genetic disorders that may contribute to abnormal clotting of the blood arterial blood gases may be checked to see how much oxygen is in the blood electrocardiogram ekg this is one of the simplest and fastest tests used to evaluate the heart electrodes small sticky patches are placed at certain spots on the chest arms and legs the electrodes are connected to an ekg machine by lead wires the electrical activity of the heart is measured interpreted and printed out how is a pulmonary embolism treated treatment choices for pulmonary embolism pe include anticoagulants also described as blood thinners these medicines decrease the ability of the blood to clot this helps stop a clot from getting bigger and keep new clots from forming examples include warfarin and heparin fibrinolytic therapy also called clot busters these medicines are given intravenously iv or into a vein to break down the clot these medicines are only used in lifethreatening situations vena cava filter a small metal device placed in the vena cava the large blood vessel that returns blood from the body to the heart may be used to keep clots from traveling to the lungs these filters are generally used when you cant get anticoagulation treatment for medical reasons develop more clots even with anticoagulation treatment or when you have bleeding problems from anticoagulation medicines pulmonary embolectomy rarely used this is surgery done to remove a pe it is generally done only in severe cases when your pe is very large you cant get anticoagulation andor thrombolytic therapy due to other medical problems or you havent responded well to those treatments or your condition is unstable percutaneous thrombectomy a long thin hollow tube catheter can be threaded through the blood vessel to the site of the embolism guided by xray once the catheter is in place its used to break up the embolism pull it out or dissolve it using thrombolytic medicine an important aspect of treating a pe is preventive treatment to prevent formation of additional embolisms what are the complications of a pulmonary embolism a pulmonary embolism pe can cause a lack of blood flow that leads to lung tissue damage it can cause low blood oxygen levels that can damage other organs in the body too a pe particularly a large pe or many clots can quickly cause serious lifethreatening problems and even death treatment of a pe often involves anticoagulation medicines or blood thinners these medicines can put you at a risk for excessive bleeding if they thin your blood too much excessive bleeding is bleeding that wont stop after you apply pressure for 10 minutes other symptoms of bleeding to watch for include signs of bleeding in the digestive system bright red vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds bright red blood in your stool or black tarry stools abdominal pain signs of bleeding in the brain severe headache sudden vision changes sudden loss of movement or feeling in your legs or arms memory loss or confusion if you have any of these you need to get treatment right away can a pulmonary embolism be prevented because pulmonary embolism pe is often caused by a blood clot that originally formed in the legs and because it is often difficult to detect a dvt before problems start the prevention of dvts is key in the prevention of pe a healthy lifestyle is one key to pe prevention it includes such things as engaging in regular exercise maintaining a healthy weight eating a balanced diet taking medicines as prescribed not smoking treatment to prevent dvts includes noninvasive mechanical measures ways to prevent dvt without medicine include compression stockings elastic stockings that squeeze or compress the veins and prevent blood from flowing backwardpneumatic compression devices sleeves on the legs that are connected to a machine that provides alternating pressure on the legs to keep blood movinggetting up and moving as soon as possible after surgery or illness movement can help keep clots from forming by stimulating blood circulation medicine anticoagulants and aspirin are often given to help prevent dvt many people remain at risk for developing dvts for a period after they are either discharged from the hospital it is important that treatment to prevent dvts continue until the risk has been resolved usually about 3 to 6 months key points about pulmonary embolisms a pulmonary embolism pe is a blood clot that develops in a blood vessel elsewhere in the body often the leg travels to an artery in the lung and suddenly forms a blockage of the artery abnormal blood clots can form due to problems such as sluggish blood flow through the veins an abnormality in clot forming factors andor an injury to the blood vessel wall a wide variety of conditions and risk factors have been linked to pes sudden shortness of breath is the most common symptom of a pe pe is often difficult to diagnose because the signs and symptoms of pe are a lot like those of many other conditions and diseases imaging tests and blood tests are used to look for a pe an important aspect of treating a pe is preventing additional clots medicines filters to keep clots from getting to the lungs and surgery are used to treat pes a pe particularly a large pe or many clots can quickly cause serious lifethreatening consequences and death next steps tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen before your visit write down questions you want answered bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you at the visit write down the name of a new diagnosis and any new medicines treatments or tests also write down any new instructions your provider gives you know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed and how it will help you also know what the side effects are ask if your condition can be treated in other ways know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure if you have a followup appointment write down the date time and purpose for that visit know how you can contact your provider if you have questions not what
