prev  next 1  4left right at long last ford has finally unveiled its new shelby gt350 billed as an “all day track car that’s also streetlegal” the new shelby gt350 features a naturally aspirated 52l v8 which ford says is its most powerful naturally aspirated production engine ever in a press release highlighting the new shelby ford says the engine will make more than 500 horsepower with a peak torque above 400 ftlbs also notable the engine utilizes a flatplane crankshaft—a first in a production ford v8 engine usually found in racing applications or exotic european sports cars a flatplane crank has the connecting rods attached to it at evenly spaced 180degree intervals as opposed to the traditional 90degree spacing this layout permits a cylinder firing order that alternates between cylinder banks reducing the overlap of exhaust pulses made to handle the most challenging roads the new shelby gt350 is built off the new sixthgeneration ford mustang design which offers 28 percent more torsional stiffness than the previous design the gt350 uses a combination of increased cuttingedge magne ride dampers increased spring rates and reduced ride height to enhance the gt350’s overall handling take a look at the pics by scrolling through the slideshow above and check out ford’s official press release below for more details los angeles ca– one of the most iconic performance mustang nameplates of all time is returning ford confirmed today with the reveal of the allnew shelby® gt350 mustang the original shelby gt350 introduced in 1965 established mustang’s performance credentials the allnew shelby gt350 mustang featuring the most powerful naturally aspirated ford production engine ever is a worldclass performance vehicle designed to tackle the planet’s most challenging roads – an allday track car that’s also street legal the new gt350 builds on carroll shelby’s original idea – transforming a great everyday car into a dominant road racer–by taking advantage of a dramatically improved sixthgeneration mustang to create a truly special driving experience driving enthusiasts behind the wheel of a shelby gt350 can expect to be treated to the most balanced nimble and exhilarating production mustang yet ford engineers took an innovative approach with gt350 rather than develop individual systems to perform well independently every component and shape is optimized to work in concert balance is the key while paying rigorous attention to detail the team pushed the envelope with cuttingedge materials and technologies“when we started working on this car we wanted to build the best possible mustang for the places we most love to drive – challenging back roads with a variety of corners and elevation changes – and the track on weekends” said raj nair ford group vice president global product development “every change we made to this car was driven by the functional requirements of a powerful responsive powerplant–nimble precise handling and massive stopping power”tracktuned driveline early in development of the gt350 it was decided a highrevving naturally aspirated v8 engine would best suit a trackfocused mustang“the final product is essentially an allnew powerplant unique to gt350–and one that takes true advantage of the new chassis dynamics of the mustang platform” said jamal hameedi chief engineer ford global performance vehicles the new 52l engine is the firstever production v8 from ford with a flatplane crankshaft an architecture typically found only in racing applications or exotic european sports cars unlike a traditional v8 where the connecting rods are attached to the crankshaft at 90degree intervals this design evenly spaces all crank pins at 180degree intervals the 180degree flatplane layout permits a cylinder firing order that alternates between cylinder banks reducing the overlap of exhaust pressure pulses when combined with cylinderhead and valvetrain advancements this permits better cylinder breathing further extending the performance envelope of the v8 the result is the most powerful naturally aspirated production ford engine ever at more than 500 horsepower with a torque peak above 400 lbft the track capability is enhanced by the output characteristics of the engine – the 52l v8 features an exceptionally broad torque curve combined with its highrevving ability the flatplane 52l v8 gives drivers an enormous amount of performance and flexibility within each gear of the lightweight sixspeed manual transmission a standard fordtuned torsen limitedslip differential optimizes cornering grip and straightline traction“make no mistake this is an american interpretation of a flatplane crankshaft v8 and the 52l produces a distinctive throaty howl from its four exhaust tips” said hameedi balanced dynamics the new mustang platform is the strongest in the history of the brand with torsional stiffness increased 28 percent over the previous model that stiff structure ensures the suspension geometry remains consistent even under hard driving on back roads and tracks front stiffness is further improved on gt350 with a cuttingedge injectionmolded carbon fiber composite grille opening and optional lightweight towertotower brace the front track has been increased while spring rates and bushings have been recalibrated all around with ride height reduced compared to mustang gt for optimum handling the wheels need to respond quickly to the contours of the road and driver input reducing unsprung mass is key to improving that response but a balance must be struck between taking mass out of a suspension and delivering truly capable braking performance due to the significant speeds the car can develop gt350 features the most trackcredible brake system ever offered on a ford vehicle in terms of absolute stopping power fade resistance and brake pedal feel the brakes are twopiece crossdrilled iron discs mounted to aluminum hats at the front are massive 394millimeter rotors clamped by brembo sixpiston fixed calipers with integrated caliper bridges while 380millimeter rotors at the rear utilize fourpiston calipers gt350 makes use of extrastiff 19inch aluminumalloy wheels – 105 inches wide in front 110 inches in the rear – clad in stateoftheart michelin pilot super sport tires with gt350specific sidewall construction tread face and compound the custom tires are designed to deliver maximum grip on the road or at the track ultraquick responsiveness to changing conditions is provided by the firstever ford application of continuously controlled magne ride dampers the dampers are filled with a hydraulic fluid impregnated with iron particles when an electric current is passed through the fluid a near instant adjustment of the suspension performance can be made with wheel position sensors monitoring motion thousands of times per second combined with other vehicle data changes can be made to each corner independently every 10 milliseconds for optimum handling performance this is a system designed not just to make the car handle better but to instill greater confidence in even the best driver obsession to detail “everything we changed on gt350 is purely functionaldriven design with the goal of improving the overall performance of the car” said chris svensson ford design director the americas “we optimized the aero shape of the car and then finetuned what was left to increase downforce and cooling airflow” all bodywork from the windshield forward is unique to this high performance model and up to two inches lower than mustang gt the new aluminum hood has been lowered and sloped compared to the base mustang tightly wrapped around the engine for the smallest possible aerodynamic signature front and rear aero elements have been balanced to work together on the track the fascia has been resculpted to provide the aggressive lower front splitter with maximum pressure and a ducted belly pan delivers significant downforce the hood outlet acts as a heat extractor while also reducing underhood lift at high speed at the rear much of the engineering was focused on creating an aggressive functional diffuser doing double duty to increase downforce and provide cooling air to the optional differential cooler and a subtle lip spoiler across the trailing edge of the decklid increases downforce without adding excess drag the athletic stance of the allnew mustang is further accentuated with recontoured aluminum front fenders to accommodate the wider front track and wider wheel arches front fender vents work with vented inner fenders to draw out turbulent air in the wheel wells and smoothly direct it down the side of the car the forwardangled grille is designed with individual openings to draw air through the radiator highpressure engine air intake cooling ducts for the front brakes and optional with the track pack an engine oil cooler and a transmission cooler focusdriven cockpit changes like everything else about gt350 the interior has been optimized for driving beginning with the specially designed recaro sport seats with a unique cloth hundreds of hours and many prototypes went into a seat that is both comfortable in daily driving and capable on the track a flatbottom steering wheel makes it easier for the driver to get in and out and is more ergonomic on the racetrack gauges are upgraded to reflect the enormous performance capability of the car chrome and bright finishes have been reduced or eliminated to prevent sun glare that may distract the driver the advanced technology inherent to mustang has been deployed for duty in the shelby gt350 an allnew integrated driver control system allows selection of five unique modes that tailor abs stability control traction control steering effort throttle mapping magne ride tuning and exhaust settings depending on driver preference to achieve maximum performance drivers are invited to test them all drivers interested in comfort convenience and entertainment upgrades may select the tech pack which includes power leathertrimmed seats shaker audio 8inch my ford touch® lcd touch screen and dual zone electronic temperature control to name a few features“we took the best ford mustang yet and massaged every aspect of the car that affects the performance driving experience” said hameedi “we tested endlessly on the most challenging roads and tracks in the world and we believe serious drivers will love the shelby gt350 mustang”share this tweet share on tumblr email related ford announces limited run of shelby gt350gt350r models for 2015april 28 2015in automotive
