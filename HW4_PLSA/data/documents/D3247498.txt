apr 28 2016 at 1255 pm‘normal america’ is not a small town of white people by jed kolko filed under demographics the precise location of normal america getty images earlier this week jim vande hei a former executive editor of politico wrote an oped article for the wall street journal accusing the washington political establishment of being out of touch with “normal america”“normal america is right that establishment america has grown fat lazy conventional and deserving of radical disruption” he wrote citing his regular visits to oshkosh wisconsin and lincoln maine as his credentials of normality it’s a familiar accusation in a year in which most presidential candidates are trying to pretend they have nothing to do with the coastal elite and after one — ted cruz — spent weeks attacking “new york values” even pbs a standardbearer of the media elite recently featured a quiz designed to assess intouchness with “mainstream american culture” with questions about fishing pickup trucks and living in a small town but that sense that the normal america is out there somewhere in a hamlet where they can’t pronounce “acela” is misplaced in fact it’s not in a small town at all i calculated how demographically similar each u s metropolitan area is to the u s overall based on age educational attainment and race and ethnicity 1 the index equals 100 if a metro’s demographic mix were identical to that of the u s overall 2by this measure the metropolitan area that looks most like the u s is new haven connecticut followed by tampa florida and hartford connecticut all of the 10 large metros that are demographically most similar to the u s overall are in the northeast midwest or center of the country with the exception of tampa two of them — new haven and philadelphia — are even on amtrak’s acela that’s “uhsellah” line none is in the west though sacramento california comes close at no 12 the large metros least demographically similar to the u s include mc allenedinburgmission and el paso both in texas both of which are younger less educated and more latino than the u s overall and honolulu where asianamericans and pacific islanders together are the majority oshkosh by the way clocks in with a score of 71 and maine’s penobscot county where lincoln is has a score of 67 both places deserve less of a claim to “normal america” than the majority of large metros do 3metro similarity to u s overall1 new havenmilford ct 9322 tampast petersburgclearwater fl 9163 hartfordwest hartfordeast hartford ct 9024 oklahoma city ok 8945 springfield ma 8936

image of the real america is a small town you might be thinking of an america that no longer exists i used the same method to measure which places in america today are most similar demographically to america in 1950 when the country was much whiter younger and lesseducated than today of course nearly every place in the u s today looks more like 2014 america than 1950 america but the large metros that today come closest to looking like 1950 america are lancaster pennsylvania ogden and provo in utah and several in the midwest and south metro similarity to u s overall in 19501 ogdenclearfield ut

american community survey u s census bureau but the places that look today most like 1950 america are not large metros but rather smaller metros and rural areas looking across all of america including the rural areas the regions that today look most demographically similar to 1950 america are the portion of eastern ohio around the towns of cambridge and coshocton and the cumberland valley district in southeastern kentucky these misconceptions affect our politics an outdated view of “normal america” is baked into the presidential election process iowa and new hampshire which vote first in the primary season and therefore have disproportionate influence rank 37th and 41st respectively in their similarity to the u s overall the states that look demographically most similar to america are illinois and new york followed by new jersey connecticut and virginia downstate illinois and upstate new york are worlds apart from chicago and new york city as native rochesterians like me know well

places may turn out to be bellwethers for a future america that will be older more educated and more racially and ethnically diverse than today and some of those places are especially deserving of public attention and investment because they worse off than most other places but if you’re trying to get outside of your bubble and get in touch with “normal america” skip the small towns of your actual or imagined past and instead start with new haven or tampa correction 710 pm april 28 an earlier version of this article omitted tampa when describing the regions of the country containing metro areas demographically similar to the u s overall
