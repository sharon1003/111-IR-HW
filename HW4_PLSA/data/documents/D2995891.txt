now and i wish people would just listen do not feed tortoises or any reptillian herbivorelettuce i mean its not a hard peice of advice to follow yet people keep saying feed it lettuce despite the evidence lettuce is mostly water has pretty much no nutrional value and on top of it all animals fed alot of lettuce are hard to swap on to other veg it tastes nice and end up basically staving to death while still feeding well on the aweful stuff feed greens like collard radish or dandilion greens many garden weeds can also be fed to torts long with different grasses and some herbs here this

tortoise you have although theyre all vegetarians their diets can vary most live off of various grasses some are fed some greens such as collard greens i dont know of any that are fed onions and peppers edit your question to include the species or a picture of it if you dont know and someone can give you the proper diet for your specific tortoise heres a good website on russian tortoises also known as horsefields which gives plenty of food items you can feed your tortoise httprussiantortoiseorgmadsnakeman · 9 years ago4 0 comment it varies some by species in general though most east grasses most tortoises i have worked with do not eat onions they seem to stay away from veggies that have very strong odors most tortoises enjoy tomatoes greens occasional apples be careful of the high sugar content dandelions prickly pear cactus minus the thorns carrots pumpkin lettuce cabbage i have worked with over 10 different species of tortoises and this is just a general list a more thorough list could be given if the species was known also if the tortoise is small make sure the piece of food you give them are small as they might not be able to eat some foods that are in large chunks i am not sure how small your tortoise is but what i have done with new born baby tortoises is take the frozen mixed veggies has carrots peas etc thaw it till its room temperature then mash it up and give it to them l hope this helps source s tortoise ownerjusthavingfun1014 · 9 years ago0 2 comment my concern is youve already got the tortoise without knowing what to feed it  it would have been kinder for the tortoise to have done some research before you got it  one thing i will say though  is do not feed it lettuce as a main food  lettuce is mainly water and has almost no nutritional value whatsoever snakeman  · 9 years ago0 0 commentthe best diet is a natural weed diet here is a site that you can download a booklet on the edible weeds to feed it has pictures so you can look in your garden an see which ones are growing most gardens with grass will have dandelions and plantains growing so they will not be hard to find but you can feed peppers but not onions you can also feed grated carrots romaine lettuce red and green leaf lettuce endive escarole radicchio chicory turnip greens mustard green kale collards spring mix mixed salad greens you can also feed a treat of a fruit salad melonapplepearstrawberries but limit it to about once a month as too much fruit is bad for them they will eat tomatoes but these too are a fruit so should not be fed too often you can feed cucumber as well all these listed things should be fed as a supplement to a natural weed diet a calcium supplement should be fed once a week twice for juveniles here is a site that will help you with the care of your tortoise httpwwwrussiantortoiseorg another excellent site to keep as a reference is this site httpwwwtortoisetrustorg the articles are really good so are worth a look hope this helps best of luck honey source sowned and loved herman and spur thigh for over 30 yearsfruitcake · 9 years ago0 0 comment you need to go online and type in what kind of tortoise you have you will then be able to gather a list of appropriate foods definitely stay away from iceberg lettuce any vegetable with the word green after it should be fine kale collards etc leafy plants are excellent too keylabex · 9 years ago0 0 comment lettuce not iceburg as it is mainly just water i know that potatoes arent good for them and too much broccoli can give them a thyroid problem but i now that squash carrots if theyre cut up small enough for them cucumber cactus green peppers green beans spinach cauliflower mushrooms eggplant some broccoli not too much you can pretty much give a tortoise anything and theyll eat it ive never given radishes or onions to my tortoise i dont know what it will do to them but i know they wont eat strong smelling foods fruits should be kept to a minimum because its too high in sugars for them you can feed her some fruits about once every other week they love red foods raspberries watermelon tomatoes strawberries etc they can eat other fruits that arent red as well like blackberries blueberries bananas kiwi and apples etc but like i said keep that to a minimum hope that helped good luck source s ive had turtles and tortoises for 9 years and still counting

even boost your brain health and energy levels you may have heard all over the news that the paleo diet has been found to be one of the best methods of achieving all of these benefits compared to any other popular fad diets out there go here httpstinyurlima hmaz the truth is that the paleo diet will never be considered a fad because its just simply the way that humans evolved to eat over approximately 2 million years and eating in a similar fashion to our ancestors has been proven time and time again to offer amazing health benefits including prevention of most diseases of civilization such as cancer heart disease alzheimers and other chronic conditions that are mostly caused by poor diet and lifestyle one of the biggest misunderstandings about the paleo diet is that its a meateating diet or a super lowcarb diet this is not true amira · 2 years ago0 0 comment1 2 3 next perhaps you would like to learn more about one of these should you donate your car how to order
