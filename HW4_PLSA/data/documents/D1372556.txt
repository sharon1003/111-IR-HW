is cell phone insurance worth it by guest author posted in insurance spending and saving technology share 8 tweet 22 pin comments 42nowadays it’s nearly impossible to leave the house without seeing someone check their email play a quick game of angry birds or look up reviews for a restaurant on their phone thanks to the many innovations in mobile technology over the last five years or so smartphone usage has become ubiquitous however along with their impressive functionality smartphones come with a higher price tag fortunately the majority of these costs are absorbed by your carrier that 200 i phone or android you paid for would be closer to 600 if you bought it completely unsubsidized without committing to a twoyear contract but unfortunately there’s a lot that can happen to your phone during your contract period it could fall into the toilet slip out of your hand and onto the pavement or accidentally get left behind somewhere never to be seen again ordinarily when this happens you’re on the hook for replacing your phone – which could cost hundreds of dollars ouch so how can you mitigate the cost of replacement if you lose or break your phone the obvious answer is to sign up for cell phone insurance when you get your new phone for approximately 7 a month depending on your carrier you get your phone replaced if anything happens to it whether or not it’s your fault seems like a great deal right not exactly why you shouldn’t buy cell phone insurance anyone who can do basic math might notice that the 7 per month you pay for insurance adds up very quickly over the course of your contract you’d end up paying 168 for a service that you may never use“that’s fine” you say “i’ll just ‘accidentally’ lose my phone a year in so that i’ll take advantage of my insurance and get a brand new device” better think twice about that too when you get your phone replaced you’re required to pay a deductible which can range anywhere between 50 and 200 and you’re not guaranteed to get a newer or better phone in return in fact it’s not even guaranteed you’ll get the same phone or even an unused one so at this point you’ve paid for two years of insurance 168 plus your deductible probably 100 all for a device that might not be as good as the one you started out with now to some people this may still sound like a good deal if you’re shelling out 268 instead of 600 you’re up 332 – if that’s how you want to think about it there are  however a number of better and more economical alternatives to consider cell phone insurance alternatives get a personal articles insurance policy many people don’t realize that they can get their phones insured elsewhere instead of paying 84 a year a regular insurance agency may offer to cover your phone at a price that’s less than half of that simply call an agent and ask to take out what’s called a “personal articles policy” on your phone one other benefit to going this route is that more often than not you won’t even have to pay a deductible once you file a claim you’ll simply receive a check to use toward the purchase of your replacement phone another advantage is that you’ll likely choose which phone to replace your old one with or at the very worst you’ll get the same model back but if you take out a policy provided by your carrier you may end up with a notquiteasgood refurbished model that said make sure you understand how this type of policy works before you sign terms can be slightly different depending on the insurance agency you go with and the premium so ask your agent a few questions first will there be a deductible what kind of losses are covered if you drop your phone and it shatters will it be replaced what about water damage how will your phone be replaced will you receive a check for the same amount you paid for it or something less to account for depreciation don’t insure your phone at all even though taking a personal articles policy might be great for peace of mind at a reasonable price it’s still a sunk cost if you’re generally careful with your possessions especially ones as expensive as most smartphones are nowadays in general i assume most people fall into this category i personally have never lost a cell phone and can probably count on one hand the number of people i know who have still accidents happen even among the best of us what do you do then1 buy a used phone instead of shelling out your hardearned money for a brand new phone think about purchasing one secondhand for considerably less let’s say you own google’s nexus s phone off contract as of this writing a new one will set you back 530 from best buy which is the only place you can buy it new that’s a pretty hefty chunk of change however if you’re willing to buy a preowned one it’s not difficult at all to find one under 225 in likenew condition with zero scratches on sites like craigslist swappacom and e bay all it takes is a few minutes of your time to dig up some great deals2 pay yourself the monthly insurance cost another alternative is to pay yourself the monthly insurance cost to create a small cushion in case you do need to replace your phone ie emergency fund  this may not cover the entire expense of replacement but then you still have the money if you make it through the entire twoyear contract with phone in hand final word long story short just think of cell phone insurance as those evil green pigs that are out to get you in angry birds you’re ultimately better off without it in all likelihood but if you absolutely must get your phone insured elsewhere have you ever bought cell phone insurance if so have you ever had to use it what other alternatives are there in case you lose your phone this is a guest post by kenny kraisornkowit who offers shopping advice
