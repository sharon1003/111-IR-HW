replace a bathtub including new tile plumbing etc i just had a consultation with a guy from home depot home services and he put it at over 3100 this is for a normal 60x33 tub its part of a larger remodelling job estimate and that is coming out much higher than id anticipated unfortunately i need to get back to him before this evening to get a 10 discount on the overall cost of the project the time deadline has me a little stressed at the moment so any advice about the item above or home depots home services department would be really appreciated thanks marcos sponsored links banned rule

existing tub install a new tub install vapor barrier concrete backer underlayment install new control valves and drain plumbing including a shower stand pipe retile the walls i would say it would be in line but not knowing where you live puts us at a handicap since prices for labor vary greatly from location to location is he furnishing the tub plumbing fittings control valve drain etc when he tells you that you have to get with him at a certain time in order to get a special discount thats bunk and a rapid sales ploy that should never be used on good customers it is called pressure member join date mar 2007posts 1251ct112607 0144 pm  3  permalinkcwbuff i would call the guy and tell him to stuff his time sensitive bid thats nothing but a pressure tactic designed to stress you out jerks like that dont deserve your business you dont need to use big box contractors to get a deal on material prices ask around for legitimate contractors in your area get at least three bids on your job

atlantas real estate prices and cost of living are fairly cheap compared to most metro areas its nothing like new york or california the price he quoted was all inclusive but im not sure all that would have been necessary as far as i know no walls should need to be torn apart as im just replacing a tub with another similar sized tub i know the greenboards behind the tiles likely need replacing as i have mold issues but i dont know of any reason why walls would have to be torn apart if the new tub is the same size as the old im assuming the visible fixtures can be changed out without opening up the wall if im off base here id love for someone to enlighten me with an overall pricetag of 11k that doesnt even include replacing the double vanity that would have been another 5k  im definately going to look at other contractors i know i know i should do that anyways but i was hoping to get a deal i could live with from home depot and save myself the hassle the 10 discount thing i know is a pretty common and effective sales tactic but ive resisted it if i end up going with them after all ill try to get it anyways but as of right now im going to take my time and gather up multiple estimates ideally id like to keep the whole remodel to under 7500 as that would fit under the rule of thumb that dictates a bathroom remodel should be less than 5 the value of the home this is for a 150k townhouse so i dont want to go crazy im prepared to go higher but not as high as this would drive the project its hard to know whats appropriate as i keep getting mixed signals between online sources and friends  family my parents had a slightly smaller bathroom done with top tier materials for 7k in miami and my bosss jaw dropped when i told her what the home depot estimate came out to shes already given me the numbers of the contractors she used for her own remodel regards marcos edit you posted while i was typing up my post cwbuff yeah id been warned about the time sensitive bid crap but as far as i knew it was a tactic typically used by less reputable contractors i was surprised to see a big name like home depot using this tactic and to be honest i wasnt mentally prepared for it member join date nov 2007posts 4ga112607 0514 pm  5  permalinkmvsuero actually you know what ive been thinking about the overall price he gave me and i cant imagine that 3100 line item included everything about the bathtub he came up with a list of around 810 items of which that one was the largest i never asked him to explain what everything else was but since wed eliminated the vanity and repainting from the quotes the only other things items would have been the flooring and a toilet replacement i find it hard to believe that could have accounted for the other 8000 of the total cost

they hd have sales or promotions that are for specific time periods so if you did not have your measure done before this date they do not have to give you the 10 off most managers mods will give you the discount anyways banned rule andor policy violation join date dec 2005posts 39968ga112607 0625 pm  7  permalinkchandler marcos i am close to you n ga so i agree with the col thing but i just finished a bathroom and i know what my part was and know they put 40k in it but that is an extreme my thinking on your job is rr the tub remove all the wall covering in the wet area and replace with vapor barrier and cbu install tile on walls and on floor furnishing materials would be around your figure but i am not sure what all else you are planning on the job and what hd was going to do aside from the tub rr anyway get your 3 estimates it is always best i even encourage my clients to do so even if i am first on the job for estimate purposes id rather them know what to expect sure i get lowballed but make up for it when the customer calls me to the job to redo what the lowballer failed to do member join date mar 2007posts 1251ct112707 0824 am  8  permalinkcwbuff my understanding was

one here can really tell you if it is or it isnt you already have the right advice get a couple more estimates from reputable contractors in your area its the only way youll know if you are getting what you need and getting what you are paying for that hd contractor already has a strike against him in my book the discount if you sign now crap is as low as low can get banned rule andor policy

doors installed 1012 years ago by a contractor arranged through hd he was independent but had a percentage arrangement with hd you are correct the contractors are not employeed with hd like any other large retailer these jobs go to the lowest bidder and has a high enough insurance policy since these contractors are not getting paid alot they often do a poor job installing member join date nov

been around 8 months or so so actually he and the contractors that would have come in actually were home depot employees he stressed that they would all be drug tested and background checked the sign right now discount wasnt the only thing that raised my suspicions about what the guy was telling me ive heard a couple sources say a bathroom remodel should stay under 5 the value of the house i told him that and he said no no its 1015 he took one look at the wallpaper in the bathroom and said that i probably would need to remove all the drywall didnt offer a particular reason he just made it sound as if it was standard procedure he said maybe i could get it off by renting a steamer and using it to loosen the adhesives a little odd that 3 times he mentions the older more difficult and mostly obsolete technique without saying a word about using chemicals that wasnt part of the bid btw as we decided to leave that part off im no expert so maybe im just misinformed but there was too much about this that didnt smell right by the end it was quite obvious i wasnt dealing with a consultant but a salesman if id known that i would have gone into it with a different frame of mind and wouldnt have let the deadline pressure affect me another big turn off was that they only deal with a limited selection you cant just ask them to use whatever home depot sells his selection of granite was a whopping 67 pieces whereas if you actually go to the store theres dozens it was the same thing with the vanity i had decided to go with one that id seen in their store and he told me that if i did that they would actually charge me the same as if they had custom built the vanity themselves on top of actually buying the vanity from the vendor thats why we removed that from the bid as well of course he kept stressing that all their offerings were all higher quality than anything home depot sells in their stores apparently anyways thanks for the advice all member join date mar 2007posts 1251ct112807 0701 am  12  permalinkcwbuff marco  i hope youve reached the point of walking away from this guy the granite thing is absolutely dishonest he sounds like the reason many of the posters here are inveterate diyers there are way too many guys like this in the home improvement field your best bet is to ask around for legitimate contractors there are probably dozens in your area that will give you an honest bid for the work you want done option 2 is to act as a gc for the work and sub out those trades you arent comfortable doing yourself plumbing and electrical come to mind stuff like installing vanities tiling etc are all weekend warrior work member join date nov 2007posts 110nd120207 0950 am  13  permalinkretired guy just had a partial bath remodel new tub and surround and
