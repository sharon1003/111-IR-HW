edit article how to buy cattle buying cattle is an essential part of raising cattle and adding money to your business knowing what to look for and finding the best deals available when purchasing cattle can present a bit of a challenge especially if you dont know whats involved or how to go about buying cattle there are two main ways cattle can be purchased by auction or by private treaty or oneonone this article doesnt go into the deep specifics rather it presents you with the initial basics of what youll need to do to start out buying cattle steps1 know what kind of cattle you are looking for you need to already know what breed age weight class and type of cattle youre looking for the type of cattle youre looking for determines what breed or composite youre interested in type  beef or dairy class  agesex group for a particular kind of livestock in this case cattle classes for sale cattle include the following bulls bull calf weanerweanling bull yearling bull 2year old bull mature bull bologna bull cows bred cow open cow threeinone cow bred with calf at side cutter cow canner cow slaughter cow heifer bred heifer feeder heifer open heifer heiferette weaned heifer heifer calf steer feeder steer dairy steer steer calf weight is always approximate rounded to 100 pounds 45 kg a word about breeds with large horns be aware that large horns mean an increased risk of harming yourself when handling the cattle as well as intimidating other animals including horses be sure you want to own cattle with large horns they look good but theyre harder to transport and to tether2 decide how much youre willing to spend this is always important as you dont want to be buying an animal that you cant pay up front right away its also important to have a firm limit in mind when attending an auction to avoid getting carried away of course if you dont have the money right on hand you will have to make arrangements to pay later preferably as soon as possible so you dont forget3 choose where you wish to buy your cattle you have two main options private sale or auction wherever you wish to buy is your choice just remember that the auction located at a local auction mart or sale barn is usually for selling culled or slaughteronly animals you will need to be very vigilant and not wear your heart on your sleeve when picking and choosing which animal s to bid on and ultimately buy you also wont be able to talk to or even get to know the owner of the animals going through the auction ring there are exceptions though farm or herddispersal auctions quite often are those that sell quality breeding stock to other producers to purchase the cows heifers and bulls being sold are what the owner had worked hard to raise and because of retirement or switching to a different enterprise a choice to sell them via auction is the best solution and many auction marts or sale barns sell weaned steers that are quite healthy though their destination is to be turned into beef not as breeding stock privatetreaty may be the best choice as you have a chance to look at and study the animals you are wanting to buy and to talk to the owner as well if you have any questions it also means a much reduced potential for exposure to disease that would occur in a generalized place of sale other places for purchasing cattle include breed registry or the breeders websites state province or county fairs online auction sitesforumsemail lists buyer beware local media and magazines and possibly your local veterinarianagricultural teacherother professionals involved in agriculture4 make arrangements to see the animals of interest phone the owner to explain that youre interested in coming over to look at his or her animals ask what time and date you should be expected to be there for the auction you will have to phone the auction mart to get times on sale dates and what cattle are being sold on what date5 go to the farm or ranch and have a look at the owners animals you should be able to get a look at the other animals the owner has on hisher farm to see the overall condition and health theyre in ask questions about breed breeding calving weaning age health history etc for the auction you should be able to have a look at the cattle in their pens prior to the start of sale and when they go through the ring to make a quick judgement call on whether theyre worth buying or not particular signs to look for include eyes should be bright clear and not runny no discharge crusty or bloodshot nose should be cool moist muzzle with frequent licking breathing should be regular and not labored beware of nasal discharge coughing wheezing or irregularshallow breathing coat glossy clean and generally unmatted especially for longhaired breeds free of extensive tag or dried feces over the body exceptions can be made if theres some tag on the rump though tails covered in tag need to be questioned beware of hair coats that appear mangy with some or a lot of hairloss have crusty lesions typically ringworm or appear dull andor dry weight cattle should look to be at their average weight for their breeding beware of severely emaciated or thin cattle even with dairy cattle if you can plainly see their ribs theyre likely undernourished or overly fat ones note though that judging body condition can be subjective attitude curious alert and contented beware of cattle that stand apart from the herd seem disinterested in you or show signs of aggressiveness no matter how subtle those signs are check the location of the whorl on the forehead––the lower the whorl the less flighty the animal 1mobility walking should be smooth and free of limps legs and feet should look normal and free of sores swelling or lesions beware of uneven gaits or subtle signs of injury by how the animal stands and walks on placement of hind feet to front feet is especially important with breeding stock but not so much with stock being raised for meat udder for dairybreeding it should be healthy size isnt necessarily an indicator of a good udder but rather placement of both front and hind ligaments it should sit forward and square not sag too much either in the front and rear quarters and not be too meaty or appear to have too many fat deposits observe the cow when she walks––the udder should not show too much sideways movement teats should be small and neatly grouped under the udder not too large andor sticking at odd angles6 negotiate a price it is helpful to know what is a good price for the animals that are being sold beforehand to avoid getting ripped off paying more than what theyre worth or worse most cattle sold by private treaty are either sold according to current prices on a cwt one hundred weight basis except for purebred stock which may be a little more expensive in the auction you have to have a maximum price you can bid up to for a particular animal and keep bidding until either it gets sold to you or the price is too high for you to bid on if the animal s arent worth your time or not to your expectations neither buy nor bid on them for buying cattle oneonone tell the owner youre just shopping around and exchange other small talk then say a friendly thanks for letting me look at your animals when negotiating the price dont just think about cash and cattle also request expertise as part of the price namely the ability to call the owner for a set time in the future to ask questions or seek help especially where problems might arise ask to see––and then check––the relevant registration papers before signing for purchase also ask to see vaccination deworming and production records7 purchase the cattle youve chosen if theyre worth it and the owner and you agree on a price for them buy them when paying for the cattle dont bring your credit card debit card or any other card with you cash or cheque check is best for this sort of purchase most auctions are an exception though as normally they will accept debit or even credit cards in addition to cash or cheque check ask if there is a guarantee not all sellers are willing to give this but where the seller is get it in writing8 bring the cattle home normally the person buying the livestock should have a trailer to take them home in if you dont have a trailer as of yet you can arrange with the seller to haul them home for you once home settle them into their new surrounds gradually feeding them well and keeping a close eye on them for the first few days until they seem contented always have a separate area set up for new cattle being brought home this gives them a chance to acclimate to their new space see your existing cattle without actually having to meet them immediately and generally feel comfortable while settling in if bringing home a bottle calf have his or her milk replacement ready if this is your first time for owning cattle already know who your vet will be and have his or her contact details somewhere easily accessible also have a halter and lead adequate food grooming gear and appropriate shelter youre helping people by reading wiki howwiki hows mission is to help people learn and we really hope

know conformation and body condition scoring information before purchasing this knowledge will help you immensely especially if youre looking to start or expand a breeding herd of cows and heifers and possibly a bull it is possible to nurse a sick animal back to health but in making this choice you need to be aware of the possible consequences––money may be lost other animals may be infected your time will need to be put toward the care and the end result may still be a sick or dead animal if you take on this challenge do so with your eyes open on the positive side it can sometimes be a very rewarding thing to do dispersal sales are the best sales to go to in order for you to find and buy some worthwhile breeding stock for your herd avoid buying sicklooking or emaciated cows cattle with a hot temper scrawny calves etc you may end up buying an animal that will cost you a lot more in what you paid the owner also consider your existing animals an illtempered or potentially dangerous animal being brought back to the farm can affect other cattle and even animals from other species warnings dont buy based on emotional value of a particular animal you should be more interested in its productivity and use to your farm and cow herd not whether it looks cute or if you feel sorry for it because it looks sick or terribly thin or even based on coat color however it should also be mentioned that there can be exceptions to this rule especially with the coatcolor and possibly the cuteness factor above all dont bring a contagious animal back to your own ranch––if in doubt its better to spend the money on a vet check before purchase or leave it altogether beware of scams and spammers though this is more rare in the cattle industry than any other industry you still need to be cautious beware of sellers who ask you for cash only and no cheque check request to pay before sending animals out especially if you dont have a trailer to bring them home with ask for your bank account number credit card number or anything else related to finances and banking that the seller has no business knowing these type of people are ones to avoid and to keep well away from most importantly if they do ask for such information do not give it out instead either tell them that youll pay them face to face after youve got the animals in your trailer or tell them i would but id have to phone the authorities first keep a look out for owners that seem to be getting impatient defensive offended or even telling seemingly talltales or lies about a particular animal youre asking about people who are just getting into the cattle business and dont have a good idea of how to negotiate prices ask the right questions or even how to watch the person you are buying cattle from for signs of falsehoods may get swindled more easily than those who are more experienced buying cattle oneonone if this may be the case and if you are that person bring a friend with you particularly a
