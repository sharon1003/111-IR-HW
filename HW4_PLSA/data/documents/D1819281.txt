in recent years people have become increasingly interested in where their food comes from and how it is produced and unfortunately despite a 20year record of safety and almost 2500 independent global scientific reviews and approvals of gmo crops there is still conflicting and confusing information about gmos monsanto toxicologist shawna lemke discusses her role in food safety talking about food safety your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  201we realize you may have questions about the safety of our products and following are answers to 10 of the questions we most commonly receive please feel free to contact us with other questions about monsanto and our contribution to the food system what are biotechnology genetic engineering genetic modification and gmos and why does monsanto use it we use agricultural biotechnology or genetic engineering of plants to develop new varieties of plant seeds with a range of desirable characteristics such as being able to resist certain insects or harsh weather conditions genetically modified crops – also known as genetically modified organisms gmos ge crops or biotech crops – include one or more genes from another organism such as a bacterium or other microbe or other plant species for plants the inserted gene results in a beneficial characteristic in the plant such as the ability to tolerate environmental pressures from damaging insects or drought gmo is commonly used to refer to gm plants as well as the food or ingredients from gm plants as a seed company monsanto studies breeds grows and sells gm seeds – as well as conventional seeds – to farmers around the world our research teams use traditional and advanced breeding techniques to develop new varieties they use biotechnology to give those varieties an additional desirable characteristic or beneficial trait that often cannot be effectively developed through breeding practices alone the gm traits we develop typically help farmers increase yields on their farmland while conserving resources such as soil and water examples of these traits are herbicide insect and drought tolerance however we also work to develop traits that can contribute to an improvement in our diets such as soybeans that produce fatty acids that provide better nutrition are foods and ingredients developed through biotechnology or gmos safe to eat yes plants and crops with gm traits have been tested more than any other crops—with no credible evidence of harm to humans or animals as consumers ourselves we place the highest priority on the safety of our products and conduct rigorous and comprehensive testing on each in fact seeds with gm traits have been tested more than any other crops in the history of agriculture – with no credible evidence of harm to humans or animals governmental regulatory agencies scientific organizations and leading health associations worldwide agree that food grown from gm crops is safe to eat the world health organization the american medical association the u s national academy of sciences the british royal society among others that have examined the evidence all come to the same conclusion consuming foods containing ingredients derived from gm crops is safe to eat and no riskier than consuming the same foods containing ingredients from crop plants modified by conventional plant improvement techniques ie plant breeding who makes sure biotech crops are safe to eat and safe for the environment independent scientists and the companies that develop biotech crops conduct tests for food feed and environmental safety scientists at regulatory agencies review this data and are responsible for regulating the crops independent scientists at regulatory agencies worldwide review the data for each potential product and make their own scientific assessment of its food feed and environmental safety there is broad global agreement among food scientists toxicology experts and regulatory food safety officials on how to evaluate the safety of gm foods and this strong regulatory framework has successfully ensured the safety of gm seeds since 1996 when the first gm crops were widely commercialized 19962014 over 60 different countries have granted over 3083 commercial use approvals on 357 different gm traits in 27 crops the majority 1458 of approvals on gm crops have been on the food safety of the product monsanto makes submissions to regulatory agencies in countries where we plan to sell our seed or where the crop is commonly imported regulatory agencies in each country must approve a potential product before it can be sold to farmers or imported for food andor animal feed in their country in the united states for example three agencies share responsibility for overseeing and approving gm crops based on their specific areas of scientific expertise the food and drug administration fda is responsible for the safety and appropriate labeling of food and feed products grown from gm crops this includes a review of nutrient composition nonnutrient composition and the potential presence of allergens the department of agriculture usda is responsible for ensuring that gm crops are safe for agriculture usda oversees and regulates field testing as well as the movement of gm crops and seeds the environmental protection agency epa is responsible for the safety of pesticides and so is responsible for reviewing gm plants that produce proteins to protect the plants from insect pests and disease the epa oversees field testing as well as the sale and distribution of pestprotected crops to ensure public and environmental health can consumers avoid gm foods in the grocery store if desired yes consumers can look for and choose those products that are labeled “certified nongm product” or “certified organic” products are foods and ingredients developed from genetically modified gm crops labeled many countries have different approaches to food labeling both on gm ingredients and other things in the united states all ingredients must be listed and when there is a meaningful difference in the safety composition or nutrition of the crop from which they were derived that difference is properly reflected on the label each country establishes its own food labeling laws within the united states the fda requires the labeling of ingredients if there is a meaningful difference in the safety composition or nutrition of the crop from which the ingredients were derived the fda could require additional information be added to the label this is not the case for gm ingredients recently the american medical association reaffirmed that there is no scientific justification for special labeling of foods that contain gm ingredients the american association for the advancement of science stated a similar stance we support these positions and the fda’s approach however we also support a food company’s right to voluntarily label its products to highlight or market attributes that are important to its customers such as products that are certified organic or products labeled as not containing gm ingredients fda’s labeling laws allow for voluntary labeling as long as the information is accurate truthful and avoids misleading consumers about the food we support voluntary labeling and a consumer’s right to choose products based on the attributes that meet their individual preferences do gm crops provide any benefits yes gm crops can improve yields for farmers reduce draws on natural resources and fossil fuels and provide nutritional benefits as demonstrated by the unprecedentedly rapid adoption of this technology among farmers gm crops can provide farmers with the means to improve yields under weed and insect pressure decrease tillage to protect soil and water resources and reduce pesticide applications thereby decreasing the use of fossil fuels some benefits such as decreased insecticide applications also are benefits recognized by consumers and environmentalists in addition some gm crops provide nutritional benefits for example certain gm crops produce more nutritious oils ie high oleic soybean oils which can help people replace solid fat in their diets potentially reducing saturated fat intake another example includes stearidonic acid sdacontaining soybeans that produce healthful long chain omega3 fatty acids like epa in 2004 fda issued a letter of enforcement discretion regarding use of the qualified health claim statement “supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of epa and dha omega3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease” docket no 2003q0401has anyone studied the longterm health effects of gm crops gmos many studies are conducted to assess health effects of gm crops since farmers first began growing biotech crops in 1996 there has been no credible evidence of harm to humans or animals in addition the following two studies assessed the longterm safety of gmos in december 2010 the european commission published a report summarizing the results of 50 research projects addressing the safety of gmos for the environment as well as for animal and human health these projects received funding of €200 million from the eu and are part of a 25year long research effort on gmos in announcing the report the commission stated “…there is as of today no scientific evidence associating gmos with higher risks for the environment or for food and feed safety than conventional plants”in 2012 a literature review of welldesigned longterm and multigenerational animal feeding studies comparing gm and nongm potatoes soy rice corn and triticale found that gm crops and their nongm counterparts are nutritionally equivalent and can be safely used in food and feed in addition to animal feeding studies are human clinical trials used to test the safety of biotech gm crops there are not currently any human clinical trials used to test the safety of gm crops this is not unusual no existing food or ingredient – gm or otherwise – has been the subject of human clinical trials however there is broad global agreement among food scientists toxicology experts and regulatory food safety officials on how to evaluate the safety of gm foods we follow these expert recommendations the starting point is identifying differences between gm crops and their conventional counterparts the experts agree that components of gm crops that are the same as existing foods do not require testing as a result the focus is on what is different in the gm crop – the inserted dnarna and the proteins resulting from gene insertion dna and rna are a normal part of every plant and animal and therefore in virtually every meal we eat dna and rna carry no dietary hazard and are “generally recognized as safe” gras in the united states and are considered safe by food safety experts globally proteins are also a normal part of the human diet are extensively digested and generally present no hazards but that must be confirmed for the specific proteins introduced in gm crops to do this an analysis of protein structure and function is performed and testing of digestibility is conducted to establish safety of the introduced proteins as long as the introduced gene protein is determined safe an initial step in the safety assessment and the gm and nongm crops are alike in all respects the gm crop is said to be substantially equivalent or “equal to” their conventional counterparts and are not expected to pose any health risks experts in the field of food safety are satisfied that this approach is sufficient and reliable to assure the gm crops are as safe their conventional counterparts this expert community does not see a need and thus does not recommend longterm tests in humans in order to establish food safety further it is quite difficult and somewhat impractical to design a longterm safety test in humans these types of tests using whole foods would require for example dietary intake of significantly large amounts of a particular food – amounts not typically consumed – over a very large span of time this is in part why no existing whole foods—whether from organic conventional or gm production – have been subjected to longterm human clinical trials is food grown with or developed from biotech seeds contributing to allergies in america the process of gm development has safeguards to prevent the introduction of new allergens there is no evidence of any new allergens being introduced in gm foods like anyone with products connected to food we take food allergies very seriously the process of gm development has safeguards to prevent the introduction of new allergens there is no evidence of any new allergens being introduced in gm foods it is important to note that there are hundreds of thousands of different proteins in the human diet and only a tiny fraction of these are significant food allergens thus the risk of a new protein being a food allergen is very low regardless in the initial stages of product development monsanto researchers avoid sources of known allergens such as nuts and eggs as potential gene sources for gm crops no matter the source of the gene though we assess every new protein for certain characteristics to help avoid the introduction of potential allergens into a gm crop assessing for potential allergenicity of introduced proteins is an fdarequired component of the safety assessment of gm crops i’ve seen reports of studies showing gm crops are safe and others saying they aren’t who and what do i believe it’s true that there is a lot of conflicting information out there but when it comes to the scientific community that has studied the issue there really isn’t any conflict – the broad consensus among scientists who have looked closely at gm crops is that they are as safe as any other crop when considering and comparing scientific data there are several things we take into account is the study designed and executed well and according to accepted methods is it in alignment with other data on the same topic do the results make scientificbiological sense is the scope of the conclusions supported by the data what is the opinion of credible scientific organizations such as regulatory agencies ama national academy of sciences there is a large body of documented scientific testing showing that the gm crops being grown and harvested are safe center for environmental risk assessment these studies focus on the wholesomeness and nutritional value of gm crops and upon the safety of the specific varieties used
