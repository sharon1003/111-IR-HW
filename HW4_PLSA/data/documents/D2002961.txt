the indian removal act became a law in 1830 and was signed by president andrew jackson the law was passed because some states were greedy about getting land that belonged to the indian tribes the law did not make the indians leave the land but was supposed to offer them a trade of something for their lands the lands that the government wanted were east of the mississippi river and the indians were supposed to move to lands that were west of the river because of the louisiana purchase the united states government had a lot of land that was west of the mississippi river at that time a lot of the land that was offered to the native americans was outside the borders of the united states the act was not supposed to force american indians off their lands they were supposed to be able to stay if they did not want to leave sometimes part of a tribe agreed to move and part did not this happened with the cherokee tribe some of the elders agreed to move but the real tribal leadership did not the cherokees were eventually forced to move and 4000 of them died as on the way to oklahoma the united states government sometimes only talked to the indian leaders who agreed to move and it ignored the indian leaders who did not some of the tribes did not agree to move and some of the tribes didn’t move from their territories as a result wars broke about between the u s government and indian tribes there were two short wars the black hawk war of 1832 and the second creek war of 1836 there was also a longer war called the second seminole war 1835–1842
