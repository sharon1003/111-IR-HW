security the blinking lights on a router are talking to you a little upfront research can prepare you for internet access failures and other computer networking problemsby michael horowitz july 11 20071055 am pdtcant get on the internet cant print to network printer its bound to happen sooner or later wired ethernet networks are pretty reliable wireless ones can be brutally finicky but no matter what type youre using its good to be prepared for networking failures in the future when there is a networking problem the knee jerk reaction may be that there is something wrong with the computer perfectly understandable but the first step in debugging a networking problem should not involve any of the computers rather you should look at the lights on the box es sitting at the hub of the network the hardware is talking to you and may have something useful to say the box es may be a number of things often there is a broadband modem cable or dsl and a separate router there may even be a third box for voip to which a normal telephone is connected on the other hand all these functions may be combined in a single box the advice is the same either way before trouble strikes look at the box es holding your network together and make a note of the normal state of every light while the network is functioning properly is the light on or off green or amber solid or blinking so that its always at hand i suggest keeping this cheat sheet right next to the device in question maybe even tape it to the box so it cant get lost now when the network fails the first thing to check is the lights on the box es thats step one step two is to examine each box and make a note of the vendor and model number then go online to learn what every light can tell you its one thing to know that a certain light is normally green but exactly what does it mean when the light is amber or blinking green instead of solid green i try to find the manual for the device at the web site of the hardware manufacturer in addition i try to find documentation on the lights at the website of the broadband provider cable and dsl modems can be modified by an isp so their documentation may be more accurate than that from the hardware manufacturer if you were given a manualbookletpamphlet with the device and can still find it great but this would be my last choice for information as it may not be up to date may cover multiple models or may not reflect customizations made by the isp if at your isps web site you cant find anything documenting the meaning of each light then contact your isp and ask them someday you may be very thankful you did share your voice1 comment tags security close be respectful keep it clean and stay on topic we delete comments that violate our policy which we encourage you to read discussion threads can be closed at any time at our discretion next article congress to grill facebooks zuckerberg over data mining election meddling
