skin health acne causes  risk factors what causes a pimple how acne breakouts develop by angela palmer updated october 09 2017share pin email print tassiiegetty acne is a chronic disorder of the sebaceous glands while sometimes it seems pimples appear overnight the development of an acne breakout is actually an extended process that begins at the cellular level all pimples begin as a blockage of the hair follicle or pore gaining an understanding of why a blockage begins and how a pimple develops will ultimately help you in treating your acne the epidermis the outermost section of the skin the part you see every day is called the epidermis the epidermis consists of five layers the deepest layer of the epidermis is the stratum germinativum it is composed of a single layer of cells cell division or mitosis takes place in the stratum germinativum the new cells begin their journey up through epidermis to the skins surface first they are pushed up through the stratum mucosum then the stratum spinosum these three layers stratum germinativum mucosum and spinosum together are called the basal layer as the skin cells travel further they reach the stratum granulosum in this layer the cells begin dying and hardening giving them a granular appearance by the time the cells reach the stratum corneum they are dead the stratum corneum is made up of these tightly packed dead skin cells which are continuously falling off and being replaced this process is called desquamation it takes approximately 28 days from cell birth to sloughing off to occur the dermis the dermis is the deepest or inner section of your skin and is made up of tough connective tissue the dermis nourishes and supplies blood to the epidermis it is also what gives the skin its elasticity the dermis is much thicker than the epidermis but has just two distinct layers the papillary layer and the reticular layer within the dermis you will find blood and lymph vessels nerves arrector pili muscles the muscles that make your hair stand on end sudoriferous sweat glands sebaceous oil glands and hair follicles it is within the hair follicle and sebaceous glands that acne begins the hair follicle the hair follicle is a small tubelike opening in the skin through which hair and sebum reach the skins surface the follicle consists of the pore opening hair root and bulb sebaceous duct and sebaceous gland although it is contained within the dermis the epidermis lines the inside of the hair follicle in a normal functioning follicle the sebaceous glands secrete oil or sebum into the pore typically sebum and dead cells shed from the stratum corneum emerge at the skins surface through the pore opening in those with acne however this process goes awry in acneprone skin sebum and dead skin cells easily become trapped within the follicle this accumulation of cellular debris and sebaceous matter forms a hard plug that obstructs the pore opening this obstruction is called a comedo it manifests itself as noninflamed bump or blackhead on the skins surface propionibacteria acnes propionibacterium acnes pacnes is the bacterium responsible for inflamed acne breakouts p acnes are regular residents within the hair follicle normally they are harmless however in acne prone skin the p acnes population grows out of control when a comedo blocks the pore opening it creates an anaerobic environment or a lack of oxygen within the follicle this anaerobic environment along with excess sebum within the pore creates a favorable environment where p acnes bacteria can thrive as the follicle becomes filled with sebum dead cells and bacteria it begins to swell the follicle wall ruptures and spills into the dermis white blood cells rush in to fight the bacteria redness and swelling occur and pus is created a pimple has now formed if the rupture in the follicle wall happens near the surface the pimple is usually minor and heals quickly it is when the break occurs deep within the dermis that more severe lesions such as nodules and cysts develop
