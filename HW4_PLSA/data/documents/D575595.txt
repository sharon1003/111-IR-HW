with the band the 2003 album elephunk featuring hey mama and where is the love was a smash hit and the foursome— william apldeap taboo and their new powerhouse vocalist fergie—were off and running frank micelottagetty images once fergie was front and center again however there came the question sowhats she been up to which turned out not to be that simple of a question globe photoszumapresscomi was constantly working as a child fergie recalled to radiocom last december i was working in school and then i would go to summers and it was fun work it was what i wanted to be doing but i was constantly always on a schedule always being professional all of that i rebelled a little bit in later life and acted like a child but thats okay i figure im about 10 years immature then i wanted a year off from show business just to be normal thats when i was 14 and then at 15 years old my friend calls me and says hey this manager wants to start this girls singing group so i started at 15 after school driving out to the san fernando valley with my mom and going to these rehearsals with these girls and was in this girl group for 11 years called wild orchid by now its pretty wellknown that fergie spent a year of that time between child stardom and black eyed peas fame barely hovering above the abyss she sat down with oprah winfrey for oprahs next chapter in 2012 and reflected on how just over a decade prior she was broke with a drug problem and a career in shambles her substance of choice was crystal meth sometimes considered flippantly as a party drug or as the costar of breaking bad but which in actuality ravages the brain it does a lot of things fergie acknowledged when winfrey remarked on meths known effects its not good it can make you crazy what got me through it was a lot of therapy soulsearching discovering why i took the drugs in the first place—because thats really what it is the singer said why then did she start doing meth jeff kravitzfilm magic she had spent the 90s making music and the occasional guest spot on tv but by the end of the decade she was downright demoralized wild orchid—fergie renee sands and stefanie ridel sands best friend from high school—had formed in 1990 originally as nrg which stood for new rhythm energy and with a couple other girls at first but despite taking meeting after meeting they didnt get a single out until 1996s at night i pray off their selftitled debut album wild orchid garnered two billboard music award nominations and they spent 1997 doing promotions and even toured with 98 degrees and n sync  they released the 1998 album oxygen featuring be mine and followed that up with more touring and appearances at highprofile events such as the macys thanksgiving day parade in 1999 they had a performance cameo on beverly hills 90210 singing at the peach pit after dark but somewhere during the making of their third album fire the group started to unravel or at least fergie did i think that initially when we broke up which you know we were all needing to break up it was hard ridel now stefanie fair a star of there goes the motherhood  recalled to bravos daily dish last year about the eventual demise of wild orchid there were a handful of years where i think all of us were kind of likeit was hard to talk about we were disappointed and we all wanted to go our separate ways now its like this 90s nostalgia fabulousness and i am so proud of what we created what we did band breakups  shakeupsit just wasnt working fergie recalled to winfrey and they tried to make us do different things and it just started being she paused feeling inauthentic and wasnt really the style that i felt that i wanted to go for and i wasnt being myself and what i should have done was said girls you know its really time for me to go on my own i need to fulfill this dream of mine to have a solo album and i didnt know how to do that i didnt know how to deal with that that confrontation i wanted to please them so you tried drugs instead winfrey said so hey why not try some meth fergie selfdeprecatingly laughed i didnt know how to deal so i got into a scene i started going out and taking ecstasy and you know from ecstasy it went to crystal meth celebrity rehabbers scott griesimage directgetty images by 2000 i spent all my childhood actor money she said in a 2006 interview with entertainment weekly and i had collection agents after me because i built up credit card debt in 2001 wild orchid performed at a show in minneapolis put on by a local radio station that also featured the black eyed peas which at the time had released two albums to little fanfare fergie got to talking with william about a solo album she was working on and he showed interest in producing it contact info was exchanged—which came in handy when rca dropped wild orchid from the label that september but in the meantime fergie was getting herself sorted out with any drugs everything is great at the beginning she told oprah then slowly your life starts to spiral down she eventually was using every day her weight dipped to 90 pounds at one point the life picture collectiongetty imagesi was suffering from chemically induced psychosis and dementia i was hallucinating on a daily basis she told the u ks i news just this week it took a year after getting off that drug for the chemicals in my brain to settle so that i stopped seeing things id just be sitting there seeing a random bee or bunny when oprah asked what her rock bottom was she replied in 2012 my brain had been playing a lot of tricks on me i thought the fbi was after me youre kind of living in this alternate reality its very strange and i started getting really paranoid so i went one day into this church and i thought that the fbi and the swat teams were outside the church this is what the drug was telling me she declined to tell the whole story of the dancing ninja on my balcony so i had a conversation with god in the church she continued im very close with my higher power i have a very strong connection with it and i said all right if i go out there and the fbi and the swat teams not out there then its the drugs and im stopping fergie was actually asked to leave the church and there was no swat team she said no fbi just me and god she kept her promise and that very day in 2001 she quit hypnotherapy helped her stay clean as did leaving wild orchid for good sands and ridel soldiered on as a duo until 2003 and moving home with her family to regroup i was hustling—using the frequent flier miles that i earned from wild orchid to work with whatever producers i knew that had a home studio she told ew  she joined the black eyed peas in 2002—another stroke of luck considering nicole scherzinger had originally passed on the opportunity to join but obviously meant to be kevin wintergetty images to this day she considers herself lucky that her brush with the dark side was relatively brief that she only lost about a year of her life im actually lucky i went crazy because that made me stop she said once fergie was in the black eyed peas the dream life became a reality after reading in a magazine that josh duhamel had a mad crush on her fergie ended up meeting him on the set of his show las vegas in 2004 when the band had a cameo they hit it off and ended up getting married in 2009 son axl was born in 2013 photos fergie and josh duhamel romance rewind kevin mazurwireimage meanwhile the bep put out three more platinum albums together  monkey business  the e n d and the beginning  won six grammys and headlined the 2011 super bowl halftime show in 2010 being interviewed by katie couric for glamour fergie was asked how she maintained her faith that things would turn out alright through all the ups and downs of her career well for some lucky reason or gift from god ive known what i wanted to do since i was a little girl the singer replied and even through disappointments and rejection there was something inside of me that wouldnt give up im a survivor and im very driven ethan millergetty images fergie also clarified to couric that while she had stayed off drugs since quitting cold turkey she wasnt sober in the sense that she abstained from all substances well im not claiming to be sober she said i think that that would be misleading i drink alcohol my father has a vineyard and the wine is really delicious by the way promising to send couric a bottle she added anyway for most addicts they would advise never to have any sort of substance i just have my own journey and i am very blessed to this day to be alive buoyed by her black eyed peas success the artist whod been singing since she was a little girl finally released that solo debut shed been hoping for too the dutchess in 2006 though hard feelings would have been understandable the ladies of wild orchid actually stayed friends with stefanie and renee cowriting the dutchess track losing my ground we live very close to each other stefanie told the daily dish her son axl is a year younger than my son rocky i just saw renee well first of all me and fergie lived together for four years back in the day we moved out we had an apartment together and then we were a band the three of us together for 11 years so in those years of teenage to late 20s we will always be connected in a way we shared just the amazing memories yeah were forever bonded whether we like it or not and i still love the girls to this day theyre like my sisters fergie also said last year weve been through a lot of experiences just like i have with the black eyed peas boys rachel murraywire image in 2013 with the black eyed peas still on the indefinite hiatus they had announced at the end of 2011 fergie announced that she was finally working on her second solo album the albuminprogress was announced again in 2014 and tentatively slated for a 2015 release obviously that didnt come to pass nor did fergie reunite with bep for their 2015 song awesome which was used in commercials for the nba finals that year nor for the single yesterday still they insisted she hadnt left the group but was rather focusing on her own album in 2016 fergie released her first new single in two years m i l f along with a starstudded video and that november came life goes on all off the then still yettobefinished new album she recently told rolling stone about what turned into an 11year gap between album releases i really thought i was going to come with that song 2014s l a love and have the album right afterwards it just wasnt ready i didnt realize how long things take—especially having a kid ive never done this before but i wasnt proud of it yet steve jenningswire image about the black eyed peas taking a 20thanniversary lap without her fergie told radiocom last december they were doing their 20th anniversary thing and its like they know i put everything into being a mom and being a wife and doing this album i know theyre in the studio making music and you know what i am so happy for anybody who needs to make music in their life they need to do that and we just need to be happy for each other having just released the upbeat but still somewhat melancholy life goes on she talked about working on it with cowriter toby gad  hes one of those guys that hes very softspoken she said hes like fergie whats going on in your life tell me whats going on i just feel safe with him to kinda just dump everything that im going through hes just one of those people in my life for me and its like a therapy session when i go to him gad isnt the type to write songs like m i l f or fergalicious with she added hes one i feel totally safe with just going to that deeper level of vulnerability and emotion and just kind of letting my guard down and letting my journals just create a song follow through and create a song which made one wonder what exactly she was going through the sweet highs and scandalous lows of fergie and josh duhamels 13year relationship twitter sadly just as her longawaited followup double dutchess was released in september so came the news that fergie and duhamel had separated after eight years of marriage with absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year they said in a joint statement to give our family the best opportunity to adjust we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public we are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family fergie was in the middle of a flurry of promotional appearances and just days beforehand hadnt given any indication of what was going on behind closed doors but sitting down with wendy williams in october she admitted that her world had been turned upside down it wasnt my plan i wanted to stay married forever she told williams  i love josh hes the father of my child we forever have that project together and were doing the best we can you made me cry gosh two minutes in and youre getting me tearing up as for making the announcement fergie said theres no right time its such a weird thing having to announce to the public because when youre in show business you have to do an announcement we wanted to be sure and really just find our footing and get all the crazy hurt stuff privately before the whole barrage of media and so as she heads into 2018 an entirely new chapter begins for fergie shes still willing to share her story about hitting rock bottom hoping she can prevent others from falling down the same hole but the heights shes climbed since are hopefully turning that year of despair into an increasingly distant memory tags fergie  meltdowns  comebacks  music  black eyed peas  drugs  features  featured  apple news  top stories show commentslatest news the big
