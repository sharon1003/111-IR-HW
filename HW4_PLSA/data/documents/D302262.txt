by alex oagana on march 2 2016 1000the koenigsegg one1 was extreme but koenigsegg took it one step further with the koenigsegg regera the regera is what you would consider the ultimate evolution of the automobile boasting 11 megawatts of power or 148852 ponies in horsepower terms from its hybridized drivetrain and v8 engine in comparison to cars like the agera rs and the one1 the regera is more luxurious and has more technology but is significantly lighter with a dry weight of 3130 pounds and a curb weight of 3589 pounds it also showcases a number of firsts for the koenigsegg brand it is fully robotized via lightweight hydraulics and has the world’s first fully foldable active topmounted rear wing only 80 examples of the regera are slated for production with an estimated price tag of 2 million aside from the firsts associated directly with the regera it also entered production while koenigsegg was still in the production phase for another model – marking the first time that the company has had more than one model in production at one time that’s a pretty big deal for a small manufacturer like koenigsegg either way the regera is koenigsegg’s latest model as of 2017 considering the power improvements and weight reduction over the one1 we’re already starting to wonder what koenigsegg will do to oneup itself again with something better until that happens let’s take a closer look at the regera and what makes it such an amazing vehicle updated 03022016 koenigsegg dropped the final specifications figures for the production version regera at the 2016 geneva motor

which itself is a restyled version of the cc8s ccr ccx and ccxr that went before it that said the new model sports enough design modifications to be worthy of the moniker and propulsion changes even though most of its design features are nearly identical to its predecessors the new model sports enough design modifications to be worthy of the moniker and propulsion changes even though most of its design features are nearly identical to its predecessors the front features a pair of new headlights a much deeper aerodynamic front splitter for more downforce and less drag and some differently shaped air intakes three nacalike air ducts have been fitted on the front hood right under the windshield the side profile looks quasiidentical with other koenigsegg models with the trademarked dihedral synchrohelix actuation doors being retained as well on the other hand the rear is quite different than its predecessors with a pair of restyled led taillights accompanying a reshaped rear wing that is hydraulically actuated another koenigsegg trademark that hasn’t been retained is the single oversized central exhaust splitting the diffuser since the regera seems to feature two exhaust exits a number of extra aerodynamic winglets and side splitters tested on the one1 have found their way onto the regera along with a restyled version of koenigsegg’s proprietary carbonfiber wheels last but certainly not least the fuel filler cap is accompanied by an electric socket while the side air intakes have been reshaped as well the package is completed by new rearview mirrors and a bunch of extra air intakes and outlets probably used to cool off the battery and electric motors the regera also features koenigsegg’s autoskin feature that allows the driver to open both doors front hood and rear hood remotely with the keyfob or from inside the car with the autoskin buttons on the center console and in addition to the rear and side view cameras an optional forward facing camera can also be installed enabling the driver to have a birdseye view of the car when parking or maneuvering in confined areas interior as with some of the exterior details i didn’t expect to find an allnew cockpit inside the regera but koenigsegg surprised everyone by finally introducing a redesigned center console entry is still made via the cool doors which the swedish carmaker insists on calling by their official name on every occasion while the seats and almost every touchable surface is engulfed in leather alcantara and carbon fiber a few touches of machined aluminum on the new center console and air conditioning vents make for a classier atmosphere compared to other koenigseggs even though the flatbottomed steering wheel and lcdbased instrument cluster look like the ones from the agera only with better clothing apple car play comes standard with the regera’s infotainment system as does wi fi connectivity eliminating the need to drag a usb cord along with you inside the car inductive charging also comes standard so as long as you’re in the car your phone won’t discharge the heated seats feature electrical adjustment with memory functions for each driver drivetrain taking everyone by surprise koenigsegg announced that the regera will also feature 700 horsepower electrical motors and an impressive 800 volt 45 k wh liquid cooled battery pack in layman’s terms and knowing how powerful the one1 is the size of that battery and that huge amount of electric power tells us that the upcoming model is plugin hybrid hypercar with a total output of over 1341 horsepower in other words koenigsegg finally beat bugatti to the punch by being the first to launch the fastest and mostpowerful hybrid hypercar excuse me megacar in the world koenigsegg finally beat bugatti to the punch by being the first to launch the fastest and mostpowerful hybrid hypercar excuse me megacar in the world having started as a supercharged ford modular v8 koenigsegg’s internal combustion engine has transformed over the years into a twinturbocharged 50liter v8 that has been developed mostly inhouse by swedish engineers every model from the swedish carmaker has sported a version of this powerplant and the regera will also only this time it will be augmented by three electric motors just like the porsche 911 turbo and some modern turbodiesels koenigsegg’s engine features variablevane turbochargers giving it more lowend torque and improved throttle response at lower revs and economical cruise since it is paired with 700 horsepowerworth of electric motors it doesn’t need to be as powerful as its predecessors delivering only 1100 horsepower and 922 poundfeet of torque on regular pump gas and a bit more than that on e85 on the electric propulsion front the regera has 700 horsepower and 664 poundfeet of torque courtesy of three electric motors that said the total system output is of at least 1500 horsepower and 1475 poundfeet of torque all of it being sent to the rear wheels through the socalled koenigsegg direct drive a patentpending technology that replaces the car’s traditional gearbox with an electric motor somewhat similar to the hybrid setup in the toyota prius unlike the prius the regera also uses two extra electric motors – one for each rear wheel – both of them getting their juice from an 800 volt 45 k wh liquid cooled battery pack that can also be charged from the outside with a power cord the hybrid setup translates into mindblowing performance numbers with 0 to 62 mph taking 28 seconds 0 to 124 mph taking 66 seconds and 0 to 186 mph taking 20 seconds furthermore 93 to 155 mph acceleration takes only 39 seconds drivetrain specifications combustion engine power 1100 hp on 91 octane din or 95 octane ron a bit more on e85combustion engine

27 seconds koenigsegg has yet to reveal pricing for the regera but an announcement posted by the company’s u k dealer on german carbuying site mobilede suggests the supercar will cost €21 million in europe which translates to around 237 million in the united states this sticker would make it significantly more expensive than most of its competitors competition pagani huayra while horacio pagani doesn’t necessarily see koenigsegg as a direct competitor the truth is that both the huayra and the upcoming regera will be marketed to similar types of customers sporting active aerodynamics more traditional gullwing doors and a body constructed from aerospacegrade carbon fiber and titanium the huayra is truly a 21st century successor to the gorgeous zonda named after the inca empire’s god of winds the latest pagani is from most points of view a fourwheeled work of art with technology and soul being mixed to create a masterpiece the huayra is powered by a bespoke twinturbocharged mercedesamg v12 that is hand built by a single engineer in affalterbach where almost all other amg engines are born with 720 horsepower and 738 poundfeet of torque on tap from the 60liter powerplant the model can accelerate from naught to 60 mph in a little over three seconds making it slightly slower than all current koenigsegg models including the much more powerful regera read our full review here hennessey venom gtbased largely on the lotus exige the hennessey venom gt is the most powerful production supercar to ever come out of the united states its 70liter lsx v8 has been twinturbocharged to develop 1244 horsepower and a tireshredding 1155 poundfeet of torque which the car then sends to the rear wheels via a sixspeed manual transmission from ricardo the venom gt is not all show and no go though since the model established a guinness world record for the fastest production car from 0186 mph back in 2013 an unofficial record for the 0200 mph run was also broken which is somewhat ironic since it had been previously held by the koenigsegg agera r thanks to its enormous power output the regera shouldn’t have a tough time taking back those records but keep in mind that hennessey is currently working on a more powerful successor for the venom gt called venom f5 read our full review here conclusion however powerful and goodlooking the koenigsegg regera ended up being the model arrives in a severely distorted marketplace for hypercars i say this because koenigsegg is no longer battling just bugatti for the world’s fastest car title but it also needs to cater to the tastes of customers who ended up buying ecohypercars like the mc laren p1 porsche 918 spyder or the ferrari la ferrari a first good step is probably the model’s name since it manages to sound both cool and descriptive especially if you know your swedish in a surprising turn of events the regera not only sports a plugin hybrid powertrain but the overall output is over 50 percent higher than the aforementioned ecohypercar trio with bugatti already announcing that the veyron successor will have a hybrid powertrain it looks like the koenigsegg is actually the first one to bring such a hybrid monster to the market i’ll reserve further opinions on the matter for when we see both models going headtohead but from where i’m standing it looks like bugatti should be pretty worried can you imagine going from 83 mph to 155 mpg in a tad over three seconds in something other than a top fuel dragster love it awesome name insane amount of power world’s fastest hybrid contenter leave it highly expensive a lot of good rivals to beat update history updated 06112015 a sales ad on german website mobilede lists the koenigsegg regera at €21 million find out more about it below updated
