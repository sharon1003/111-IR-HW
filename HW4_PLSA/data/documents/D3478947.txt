damage human wellbeing on a global scale 2 even crippling or destroying modern civilization 3 an event that could cause human extinction or permanently and drastically curtail humanitys potential is known as an existential risk 4potential global catastrophic risks include anthropogenic risks technology governance and natural or external risks 3 examples of technology risks are hostile artificial intelligence and destructive biotechnology or nanotechnology insufficient or malign global governance creates risks in the social and political domain such as a global war including nuclear holocaust

global priority 5global catastrophic vs existential  editphilosopher nick bostrom classifies risks according to their scope and intensity 5 a global catastrophic risk is any risk that is at least global in scope and is not subjectively imperceptible in intensity those that are at least transgenerational affecting all future generations in scope and terminal  clarification needed in intensity are classified as existential risks while a global catastrophic risk may kill the vast majority of life on earth humanity could still potentially recover an existential risk on the other hand is one that either destroys humanity and presumably all but the most rudimentary species of nonhuman lifeforms andor plant life entirely or at least prevents any chance of civilization recovering bostrom considers existential risks to be far more significant 6similarly in catastrophe risk and response richard posner singles out and groups together events that bring about utter overthrow or ruin on a global rather than a local or regional scale posner singles out such events as worthy of special attention on costbenefit grounds because they could directly or indirectly jeopardize the survival of the human race as a whole 7 posners events include meteor impacts runaway global warming grey goo bioterrorism and particle accelerator accidents researchers experience difficulty in studying near human extinction directly since humanity has never been destroyed before 8 while this does not mean that it will not be in the future it does make modelling existential risks difficult due in part to survivorship bias other classifications  editbostrom identifies four types of existential risk bangs are sudden catastrophes which may be accidental or deliberate he thinks the most likely sources of bangs are malicious use of nanotechnology nuclear war and the possibility that the universe is a simulation that will end crunches are scenarios in which humanity survives but civilization is irreversibly destroyed the most likely causes of this he believes are exhaustion of natural resources a stable global government that prevents technological progress or dysgenic pressures that lower average intelligence shrieks are undesirable futures for example if a single mind enhances its powers by merging with a computer it could dominate human civilization bostrom believes that this scenario is most likely followed by flawed superintelligence and a repressive totalitarian regime whimpers are the gradual decline of human civilization or current values he thinks the most likely cause would be evolution changing moral preference followed by extraterrestrial invasion 4likelihood  editsome risks such as that from asteroid impact with a oneinamillion chance of causing humanitys extinction in the next century 9 have had their probabilities predicted using straightforward wellunderstood and in principle precise methods although even in cases like these the exact rate of large impacts is contested 10 similarly the frequency of volcanic eruptions of sufficient magnitude to cause catastrophic climate change similar to the toba eruption which may have almost caused the extinction of the human race 11 has been estimated at about 1 in every 50000 years 12the relative danger posed by other threats is much more difficult to calculate in 2008 an informal survey of small but illustrious group of experts on different global catastrophic risks at the global catastrophic risk conference at the university of oxford suggested a 19 chance of human extinction by the year 2100 the conference report cautions that the results should be taken with a grain of salt 13 in november 2017 a statement by 15364 scientists from 184 countries indicated that increasing levels of greenhouse gases from use of fossil fuels human population growth deforestation and overuse of land for agricultural production particularly by farming ruminants for meat consumption are trending in ways that forecast an increase in human misery over coming decades 3risk estimated probability for human extinction before 2100overall probability 19molecular nanotechnology weapons 5superintelligent

the global challenges foundation estimates that an average american is more than five times more likely to die during a humanextinction event than in a car crash 14 15there are significant methodological challenges in estimating these risks with precision most attention has been given to risks to human civilization over the next 100 years but forecasting for this length of time is difficult the types of threats posed by nature may prove relatively constant though new risks could be discovered anthropogenic threats however are likely to change dramatically with the development of new technology while volcanoes have been a threat throughout history nuclear weapons have only been an issue since the 20th century historically the ability of experts to predict the future over these timescales has proved very limited manmade threats such as nuclear war or nanotechnology are harder to predict than natural threats due to the inherent methodological difficulties in the social sciences in general it is hard to estimate the magnitude of the risk from this or other dangers especially as both international relations and technology can change rapidly existential risks pose unique challenges to prediction even more than other longterm events because of observation selection effects unlike with most events the failure of a complete extinction event to occur in the past is not evidence against their likelihood in the future because every world that has experienced such an extinction event has no observers so regardless of their frequency no civilization observes existential risks in its history 8 these anthropic issues can be avoided by looking at evidence that does not have such selection effects such as asteroid impact craters on the moon or directly evaluating the likely impact of new technology 5moral importance of existential risk  editsome scholars have strongly favored reducing existential risk on the grounds that it greatly benefits future generations derek parfit argues that extinction would be a great loss because our descendants could potentially survive for four billion years before the expansion of the sun makes the earth uninhabitable 16 17 nick bostrom argues that there is even greater potential in colonizing space if future humans colonize space they may be able to support a very large number of people on other planets potentially lasting for trillions of years 6 therefore reducing existential risk by even a small amount would have a very significant impact on the expected number of people who will exist in the future exponential discounting might make these future benefits much less significant however gaverick matheny has argued that such discounting is inappropriate when assessing the value of existential risk reduction 9some economists have discussed the importance of global catastrophic risks though not existential risks martin weitzman argues that most of the expected economic damage from climate change may come from the small chance that warming greatly exceeds the midrange expectations resulting in catastrophic damage 18 richard posner has argued that we are doing far too little in general about small hardtoestimate risks of largescale catastrophes 19numerous cognitive biases can influence peoples judgment of the importance of existential risks including scope insensitivity hyperbolic discounting availability heuristic the conjunction fallacy the affect heuristic and the overconfidence effect 20scope insensitivity influences how bad people consider the extinction of the human race to be for example when people are motivated to donate money to altruistic causes the quantity they are willing to give does not increase linearly with the magnitude of the issue people are roughly as concerned about 200000 birds getting stuck in oil as they are about 2000 21 similarly people are often more concerned about threats to individuals than to larger groups 20there are economic reasons that can explain why so little effort is going into existential risk reduction it is a global good so even if a large nation decreases it that nation will only enjoy a small fraction of the benefit of doing so furthermore the vast majority of the benefits may be enjoyed by far future generations and though these quadrillions of future people would in theory perhaps be willing to pay massive sums for existential risk reduction no mechanism for such a transaction exists 5potential sources of risk  editsome sources of catastrophic risk are natural such as meteor impacts or supervolcanos some of these have caused mass extinctions in the past on the other hand some risks are manmade such as global warming 22 environmental degradation engineered pandemics and nuclear war according to the future of humanity institute human extinction is more likely to result from anthropogenic causes than natural causes 5 23anthropogenic  editin 2012 cambridge university created the cambridge project for existential risk which examines threats to humankind caused by developing technologies 24 the stated aim is to establish within the university a multidisciplinary research centre centre for the study of existential risk dedicated to the scientific study and mitigation of existential risks of this kind 24the cambridge project states that the greatest threats to the human species are manmade they are artificial intelligence global warming nuclear war and rogue biotechnology 25artificial intelligence  editmain articles existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence ai takeover friendly artificial intelligence and technological singularity it has been suggested that learning computers that rapidly become superintelligent may take unforeseen actions or that robots would outcompete humanity one technological singularity scenario 26 because of its exceptional scheduling and organizational capability and the range of novel technologies it could develop it is possible that the first earth superintelligence to emerge could rapidly become matchless and unrivaled conceivably it would be able to bring about almost any possible outcome and be able to foil virtually any attempt that threatened to prevent it achieving its objectives 27 it could eliminate wiping out if it chose any other challenging rival intellects alternatively it might manipulate or persuade them to change their behavior towards its own interests or it may merely obstruct their attempts at interference 27 in bostroms book superintelligence paths dangers strategies he defines this as the control problem 28vernor vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans he calls this  the singularity  29 he suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans 30 this is discussed by a philosophy called singularitarianism physicist stephen hawking microsoft founder bill gates and space x founder elon musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that ai could evolve to the point that humans could not control it with hawking theorizing that this could spell the end of the human race 31 in 2009 experts attended a conference hosted by the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence aaai to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any sort of autonomy and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard they noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semiautonomy including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved cockroach intelligence they noted that selfawareness as depicted in sciencefiction is probably unlikely but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls 29 various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy and which pose some inherent concerns 32 33eliezer yudkowsky believes that risks from artificial intelligence are harder to predict than any other known risks he also argues that research into artificial intelligence is biased by anthropomorphism since people base their judgments of artificial intelligence on their own experience he claims that they underestimate the potential power of ai he distinguishes between risks due to technical failure of ai which means that flawed algorithms prevent the ai from carrying out its intended goals and philosophical failure which means that the ai is programmed to realize a flawed ideology 34biotechnology  editmain article biotechnology risk biotechnology can pose a global catastrophic risk in the form of bioengineered organisms  viruses bacteria fungi plants or animals  in many cases the organism will be a pathogen of humans livestock crops or other organisms we depend upon eg pollinators or gut bacteria  however any organism able to catastrophically disrupt ecosystem functions eg highly competitive weeds outcompeting essential crops poses a biotechnology risk a biotechnology catastrophe may be caused by accidentally releasing a genetically engineered organism escaping from controlled environments by the planned release of such an organism which then turns out to have unforeseen and catastrophic interactions with essential natural or agroecosystems or by intentional usage of biological agents in biological warfare bioterrorism attacks 35 terrorist applications of biotechnology have historically been infrequent 35 to what extent this is due to a lack of capabilities or motivation is not resolved 35exponential growth has been observed in the biotechnology sector and noun and chyba predict that this will lead to major increases in biotechnological capabilities in the coming decades 35 they argue that risks from biological warfare and bioterrorism are distinct from nuclear and chemical threats because biological pathogens are easier to massproduce and their production is hard to control especially as the technological capabilities are becoming available even to individual users 35given current development more risk from novel engineered pathogens is to be expected in the future 35 pathogens may be intentionally or unintentionally genetically modified to change virulence and other characteristics 35 for example a group of australian researchers unintentionally changed characteristics of the mousepox virus while trying to develop a virus to sterilize rodents 35 the modified virus became highly lethal even in vaccinated and naturally resistant mice 36 37 the technological means to genetically modify virus characteristics are likely to become more widely available in the future if not properly regulated 35noun and chyba propose three categories of measures to reduce risks from biotechnology and natural pandemics regulation or prevention of potentially dangerous research improved recognition of outbreaks and developing facilities to mitigate disease outbreaks eg better andor more widely distributed vaccines 35 see also natural pathogens below cyberattack  editmain article cyberattack cyberattacks have the potential to destroy everything from personal data to electric grids christine peterson cofounder and past president of the foresight institute believes a cyberattack on electric grids has the potential to be a catastrophic risk 38 peterson also identifies attacks on internet of things devices as potentially catastrophic global warming  editmain articles effects of global warming runaway climate change and avoiding dangerous climate change global warming refers to the warming caused by human technology since the 19th century or earlier global warming reflects abnormal variations to the expected climate within the earths atmosphere and subsequent effects on other parts of the earth projections of future climate change suggest further global warming sea level rise and an increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events and weatherrelated disasters effects of global warming include loss of biodiversity stresses to existing foodproducing systems increased spread of known infectious diseases such as malaria and rapid mutation of microorganisms it has been suggested that runaway global warming  runaway climate change might cause earth to become searingly hot like venus in less extreme scenarios it could cause the end of civilization as we know it 39environmental disaster  editmain article environmental disaster an environmental or ecological disaster such as world crop failure and collapse of ecosystem services could be induced by the present trends of overpopulation economic development 40 and non sustainable agriculture an october 2017 report published in the lancet stated that toxic air water soils and workplaces were collectively responsible for 9 million deaths worldwide in 2015 particularly from air pollution which was linked to deaths by increasing susceptibility to noninfectious diseases such as heart disease stroke and lung cancer 41 the report warned that the pollution crisis was exceeding the envelope on the amount of pollution the earth can carry and “threatens the continuing survival of human societies” 41most environmental scenarios involve one or more of the following holocene extinction event 42 scarcity of water that could lead to approximately one half of the earths population being without safe drinking water pollinator decline overfishing massive deforestation desertification climate change or massive water pollution episodes detected in the early 21st century a threat in this direction is colony collapse disorder 43 a phenomenon that might foreshadow the imminent extinction 44 of the western honeybee as the bee plays a vital role in pollination its extinction would severely disrupt the food chain mineral resource exhaustion  editromanian american economist nicholas georgescuroegen a progenitor in economics and the paradigm founder of ecological economics has argued that the carrying capacity of earth — that is earths capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earths finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use and consequently that the world economy as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse leading to the demise of human civilization itself 45 303f ecological economist and steadystate theorist herman daly a student of georgescuroegen has propounded the same argument by asserting that  all we can do is to avoid wasting the limited capacity of creation to support present and future life on earth 46 370ever since georgescuroegen and daly published these views various scholars in the field have been discussing the existential impossibility of distributing earths finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations this number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us as there is little way of knowing in advance if or when mankind will eventually face extinction in effect any conceivable intertemporal distribution of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point 47 253–256 48 165 49 168–171 50 150–153 51 106–109 52 546–549 53 142–145experimental technology accident  editfurther information grey goo and bioterrorism nick bostrom suggested that in the pursuit of knowledge humanity might inadvertently create a device that could destroy earth and the solar system 54 investigations in nuclear and highenergy physics could create unusual conditions with catastrophic consequences for example scientists worried that the first nuclear test might ignite the atmosphere 55 56 more recently others worried that the rhic 57 or the large hadron collider might start a chainreaction global disaster involving black holes strangelets or false vacuum states these particular concerns have been refuted 58 59 60 61 but the general concern remains biotechnology could lead to the creation of a pandemic chemical warfare could be taken to an extreme nanotechnology could lead to grey goo in which outofcontrol selfreplicating robots consume all living matter on earth while building more of themselves—in both cases either deliberately or by accident 62nanotechnology  editsee also grey goo and potential risks of nanotechnology many nanoscale technologies are in development or currently in use 63 the only one that appears to pose a significant global catastrophic risk is molecular manufacturing a technique that would make it possible to build complex structures at atomic precision 64 molecular manufacturing requires significant advances in nanotechnology but once achieved could produce highly advanced products at low costs and in large quantities in nanofactories of desktop proportions 63 64 when nanofactories gain the ability to produce other nanofactories production may only be limited by relatively abundant factors such as input materials energy and software 63molecular manufacturing could be used to cheaply produce among many other products highly advanced durable weapons 63 being equipped with compact computers and motors these could be increasingly autonomous and have a large range of capabilities 63phoenix and treder classify catastrophic risks posed by nanotechnology into three categories from augmenting the development of other technologies such as ai and biotechnology by enabling massproduction of potentially dangerous products that cause risk dynamics such as arms races depending on how they are used from uncontrolled selfperpetuating processes with destructive effects at the same time nanotechnology may be used to alleviate several other global catastrophic risks 63several researchers state that the bulk of risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war arms races and destructive global government 36 63 65 several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races compared to eg nuclear arms races a large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low 63the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will be cheap and easy to hide 63therefore lack of insight into the other parties capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes 63 66molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade 63 a potential peacepromoting factorwars of aggression may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield 63since selfregulation by all state and nonstate actors seems hard to achieve 67 measures to mitigate warrelated risks have mainly been proposed in the area of international cooperation 63 68 international infrastructure may be expanded giving more sovereignty to the international level this could help coordinate efforts for arms control international institutions dedicated specifically to nanotechnology perhaps analogously to the international atomic energy agency iaea or general arms control may also be designed 68 one may also jointly make differential technological progress on defensive technologies a policy that players should usually favour 63 the center for responsible nanotechnology also suggests some technical restrictions 69 improved transparency regarding technological capabilities may be another important facilitator for armscontrol a grey goo is another catastrophic scenario which was proposed by eric drexler in his 1986 book engines of creation 70 and has been a theme in mainstream media and fiction 71 72 this scenario involves tiny selfreplicating robots that consume the entire biosphere using it as a source of energy and building blocks nowadays however nanotech experts  including drexler  discredit the scenario according to chris phoenix a socalled grey goo could only be the product of a deliberate and difficult engineering process not an accident 73warfare and mass destruction  editfurther information nuclear holocaust world war iii and cold war iijoseph pennell s 1918 liberty bond poster calls up the pictorial image of an invaded burning new york city the scenarios that have been explored most frequently are nuclear warfare and doomsday devices although the probability of a nuclear war per year is slim professor martin hellman has described it as inevitable in the long run unless the probability approaches zero inevitably there will come a day when civilizations luck runs out 74 during the cuban missile crisis u s president john f kennedy estimated the odds of nuclear war at somewhere between one out of three and even 75 the united states and russia have a combined arsenal of 14700 nuclear weapons 76 and there is an estimated total of 15700 nuclear weapons in existence worldwide 76while popular perception sometimes takes nuclear war as the end of the world experts assign low probability to human extinction from nuclear war 77 78 in 1982 brian martin estimated that a us–soviet nuclear exchange might kill 400–450 million directly mostly in the united states europe and russia and maybe several hundred million more through followup consequences in those same areas 77nuclear war could yield unprecedented human death tolls and habitat destruction detonating large numbers of nuclear weapons would have an immediate short term and longterm effects on the climate causing cold weather and reduced sunlight and photosynthesis 79 that may generate significant upheaval in advanced civilizations 80beyond nuclear other threats to humanity include biological warfare bw and bioterrorism by contrast chemical warfare while able to create multiple local catastrophes is unlikely to create a global one world population and agricultural crisis  editmain articles malthusian catastrophe and human overpopulation the 20th century saw a rapid increase in human population due to medical developments and massive increases in agricultural productivity 81 such as the green revolution 82 between 1950 and 1984 as the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe world grain production increased by 250 the green revolution in agriculture helped food production to keep pace with worldwide population growth or actually enabled population growth the energy for the green revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers natural gas pesticides oil and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation 83 david pimentel professor of ecology and agriculture at cornell university and mario giampietro senior researcher at the national research institute on food and nutrition inran place in their 1994 study food land population and the u s economy the maximum u s population for a sustainable economy at 200 million to achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster the united states must reduce its population by at least onethird and world population will have to be reduced by twothirds says the study 84the authors of this study believe that the mentioned agricultural crisis will begin to impact us after 2020 and will become critical after 2050 geologist dale allen pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before 85 86wheat is humanitys 3rd most produced cereal extant fungal infections such as ug99 87 a kind of stem rust can cause 100 crop losses in most modern varieties little or no treatment is possible and infection spreads on the wind should the worlds large grain producing areas become infected then there would be a crisis in wheat availability leading to price spikes and shortages in other food products 88nonanthropogenic  editasteroid impact  editmain articles asteroidimpact avoidance and impact event several asteroids have collided with earth in recent geological history the chicxulub asteroid for example is theorized to have caused the extinction of the nonavian dinosaurs 66 million years ago at the end of the cretaceous no sufficiently large asteroid currently exists in an earthcrossing orbit however a comet of sufficient size to cause human extinction could impact the earth though the annual probability may be less than 10 −8 89 geoscientist brian toon estimates that a 60mile meteorite would be large enough to incinerate everybody 90 asteroids with around a 1 km diameter have impacted the earth on average once every 500000 years these are probably too small to pose an extinction risk but might kill billions of people 89 91 larger asteroids are less common small nearearth asteroids are regularly observed as of 2013 spaceguard estimates it has identified 95 of all neos over 1 km in size 92in 14 million years the star gliese 710 is expected to start causing an increase in the number of meteoroids in the vicinity of earth when it passes within 11 light years of the sun perturbing the oort cloud dynamic models by garcíasánchez predict a 5 increase in the rate of impact 93 objects perturbed from the oort cloud take millions of years to reach the inner solar system extraterrestrial invasion  editmain article alien invasion extraterrestrial life could invade earth 94 either to exterminate and supplant human life enslave it under a colonial system steal the planets resources or destroy the planet altogether although evidence of alien life has never been documented scientists such as carl sagan have postulated that the existence of extraterrestrial life is very likely in 1969 the  extraterrestrial exposure law  was added to the united states code of federal regulations title 14 section 1211 in response to the possibility of biological contamination resulting from the u s apollo space program it was removed in 1991 95 scientists consider such a scenario technically possible but unlikely 96an article in the new york times discussed the possible threats for humanity of intentionally sending messages aimed at extraterrestrial life into the cosmos in the context of the seti efforts several renowned public figures such as stephen hawking and elon musk have argued against sending such messages on the grounds that extraterrestrial civilizations are probably technologically far more advanced than humanity and could pose an existential threat to humanity 97natural climate change  editclimate change refers to a lasting change in the earths climate the climate has ranged from ice ages to warmer periods when palm trees grew in antarctica it has been hypothesized that there was also a period called  snowball earth  when all the oceans were covered in a layer of ice these global climatic changes occurred slowly prior to the rise of human civilization about 10 thousand years ago near the end of the last major ice age when the climate became more stable however abrupt climate change on the decade time scale has occurred regionally since civilization originated during a period of stable climate a natural variation into a new climate regime colder or hotter could pose a threat to civilization in the history of the earth many ice ages are known to have occurred more ice ages will be possible at an interval of 40000–100000 years an ice age would have a serious impact on civilization because vast areas of land mainly in north america europe and asia could become uninhabitable it would still be possible to live in the tropical regions but with possible loss of humidity and water currently the world is existing in an interglacial period within a much older glacial event the last glacial expansion ended about 10000 years ago and all civilizations evolved later than this scientists do not predict that a natural ice age will occur anytime soon cosmic threats  edita number of astronomical threats have been identified massive objects eg a star large planet or black hole could be catastrophic if a close encounter occurred in the solar system in april 2008 it was announced that two simulations of longterm planetary movement one at paris observatory and the other at university of california santa cruz indicate a 1 chance that mercury s orbit could be made unstable by jupiters gravitational pull sometime during the lifespan of the sun were this to happen the simulations suggest a collision with earth could be one of four possible outcomes the others being mercury colliding with the sun colliding with venus or being ejected from the solar system altogether if mercury were to collide with earth all life on earth could be obliterated entirely an asteroid 15 km wide is believed to have caused the extinction of the nonavian dinosaurs whereas mercury is 4879 km in diameter 98another cosmic threat is a gammaray burst typically produced by a supernova when a star collapses inward on itself and then bounces outward in a massive explosion under certain circumstances these events are thought to produce massive bursts of gamma radiation emanating outward from the axis of rotation of the star if such an event were to occur oriented towards the earth the massive amounts of gamma radiation could significantly affect the earths atmosphere and pose an existential threat to all life such a gamma ray burst may have been the cause of the ordovician–silurian extinction events neither this scenario nor mercurys orbit destabilizing threats are likely in the foreseeable future 99if the solar system were to pass through a dark nebula a cloud of cosmic dust severe global climate change would occur 100a powerful solar flare or solar superstorm which is a drastic and unusual decrease or increase in the suns power output could have severe consequences for life on earth if our universe lies within a false vacuum a bubble of lowerenergy vacuum could come to exist by chance or otherwise in our universe and catalyze the conversion of our universe to a lower energy state in a volume expanding at nearly the speed of light destroying all that we know without forewarning 101  further explanation needed such an occurrence is called vacuum decay geomagnetic reversal  editmain article geomagnetic reversal the magnetic poles of the earth shifted many times in geologic history the duration of such a shift is still debated theories exist that during such times the earths magnetic field would be substantially weakened threatening civilization by allowing radiation from the sun especially solar wind solar flares or cosmic radiation to reach the surface these theories have been somewhat discredited as statistical analysis shows no evidence for a correlation between past reversals and past extinctions 102 103global pandemic  editmain article pandemic numerous historical examples of pandemics 104 had a devastating effect on a large number of people the present unprecedented scale and speed of human movement make it more difficult than ever to contain an epidemic through local quarantines a global pandemic has become a realistic threat to human civilization naturally evolving pathogens will ultimately develop an upper limit to their virulence 105 pathogen with the highest virulence quickly killing their hosts reduce their chances of spread the infection to new hosts or carriers 106 this simple model predicts that  if virulence and transmission are not genetically linked  pathogens will evolve towards low virulence and rapid transmission however this is not necessarily a safeguard against a global catastrophe for the following reasons1 the fitness advantage of limited virulence is primarily a function of a limited number of hosts any pathogene with a high virulence high transmission rate and long incubation time may have already caused a catastrophic pandemic before ultimately virulence is limited through natural selection 2 in models where virulence level and rate of transmission are related high levels of virulence can evolve 107 virulence is instead limited by the existence of complex populations of hosts with different susceptibilities to infection or by some hosts being geographically isolated 105 the size of the host population and competition between different strains of pathogens can also alter virulence 108 3 a pathogen that infects humans as a secondary host and primarily infects another species a zoonosis has no constraints on its virulence in people since the accidental secondary infections do not affect its evolution 109naturally arising pathogens and neobiota  editin a similar scenario to biotechnology risks naturally evolving organisms can disrupt essential ecosystem functions an example of a pathogen able to threaten global food security is the wheat rust ug99 other examples are neobiota  invasive species  ie organisms that become disruptive to ecosystems once transported – often as a result of human activity – to a new geographical region normally the risk is a local disruption if it becomes coupled with serious crop failures and a global famine it may however pose a global catastrophic risk megatsunami  editmain article megatsunami a remote possibility is a megatsunami it has been suggested that a megatsunami caused by the collapse of a volcanic island could for example destroy the entire east coast of the united states but such predictions are based on incorrect assumptions and the likelihood of this happening has been greatly exaggerated in the media 110 while none of these scenarios are likely to destroy humanity completely they could regionally threaten civilization there have been two recent highfatality tsunamis—after the 2011 tōhoku earthquake and the 2004 indian ocean earthquake a megatsunami could have astronomical origins as well such as an asteroid impact in an ocean 111volcanism  editmain article supervolcano a geological event such as massive flood basalt volcanism or the eruption of a supervolcano 112 could lead to a socalled volcanic winter similar to a nuclear winter one such event the toba eruption 113 occurred in indonesia about 71500 years ago according to the toba catastrophe theory 114 the event may have reduced human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals yellowstone caldera is another such supervolcano having undergone 142 or more caldera forming eruptions in the past 17 million years 115 a massive volcano eruption would eject extraordinary volumes of volcanic dust toxic and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere with serious effects on global climate towards extreme global cooling volcanic winter if short term and ice age if long term or global warming if greenhouse gases were to prevail when the supervolcano at yellowstone last erupted 640000 years ago the thinnest layers of the ash ejected from the caldera spread over most of the united states west of the mississippi river and part of northeastern mexico the magma covered much of yellowstone park and extended beyond covering much of the ground from yellowstone river in the east to the idaho falls in the west with some of the flows extending north beyond mammoth springs 116according to a recent study if it were to erupt as a supervolcano again you’d get 1–3 millimeters thickness of ash right out to new york which is enough to “reduce traction on roads and runways short out electrical transformers and cause respiratory problems” there would be centimeters of thickness over much of the mid west enough to disrupt crops and livestock especially if it happened at critical time in the growing season and a meter of thickness out to quite a distance the worst affected in their list of cites is billings population 109000 which their model predicted would get an estimated 103 to 18 meters thickness of ash 117the main long term effect is through global climate change which reduces the temperature globally by about 5 15 degrees c for a decade together with the direct effects of the deposits of ash on their crops a large supervolcano like toba would deposit one or two meters thickness of ash over an area of several million square kilometers 1000 cubic kilometers is equivalent to a one meter thickness of ash spread over a million square kilometers if that happened in some densely populated agricultural area such as india it could destroy one or two seasons of crops for two billion people 118however yellowstone shows no signs of a supereruption at present and it is not certain that a future supereruption will occur there 119 120research published in 2011 finds evidence that massive volcanic eruptions caused massive coal combustion supporting models for significant generation of greenhouse gases researchers have suggested that massive volcanic eruptions through coal beds in siberia would generate significant greenhouse gases and cause a runaway greenhouse effect 121 massive eruptions can also throw enough pyroclastic debris and other material into the atmosphere to partially block out the sun and cause a volcanic winter as happened on a smaller scale in 1816 following the eruption of mount tambora the socalled year without a summer such an eruption might cause the immediate deaths of millions of people several hundred miles from the eruption and perhaps billions of deaths 122 worldwide due to the failure of the monsoon

deep underneath a craton such an event may be forceful enough to launch an extreme amount of material from the crust and mantle into a suborbital trajectory proposed mitigation  editplanetary management and respecting planetary boundaries have been proposed as approaches to preventing ecological catastrophes within the scope of these approaches the field of geoengineering encompasses the deliberate largescale engineering and manipulation of the planetary environment to combat or counteract anthropogenic changes in atmospheric chemistry space colonization is a proposed alternative to improve the odds of surviving an extinction scenario 123 solutions of this scope may require megascale engineering food storage has been proposed globally but the monetary cost would be high furthermore it would likely contribute to the current millions of deaths per year due to malnutrition  citation neededsome survivalists stock survival retreats with multipleyear food supplies the svalbard global seed vault is buried 400 feet 120 m inside a mountain on an island in the arctic it is designed to hold 25 billion seeds from more than 100 countries as a precaution to preserve the worlds crops the surrounding rock is −6 °c 21 °f as of 2015 but the vault is kept at −18 °c 0 °f by refrigerators powered by locally sourced coal 124 125more speculatively if society continues to function and if the biosphere remains habitable calorie needs for the present human population might in theory be met during an extended absence of sunlight given sufficient advance planning conjectured solutions include growing mushrooms on the dead plant biomass left in the wake of the catastrophe converting cellulose to sugar or feeding natural gas to methanedigesting bacteria 126 127global catastrophic risks and global governance  editinsufficient global governance creates risks in the social and political domain but the governance mechanisms develop more slowly than technological and social change there are concerns from governments the private sector as well as the general public about the lack of governance mechanisms to efficiently deal with risks negotiate and adjudicate between diverse and conflicting interests this is further underlined by an understanding of the interconnectedness of global systemic risks 128organizations  editthe bulletin of the atomic scientists est 1945 is one of the oldest global risk organizations founded after the public became alarmed by the potential of atomic warfare in the aftermath of wwii it studies risks associated with nuclear war and energy and famously maintains the doomsday clock established in 1947 the foresight institute est 1986 examines the risks of nanotechnology and its benefits it was one of the earliest organizations to study the unintended consequences of otherwise harmless technology gone haywire at a global scale it was founded by k eric drexler who postulated  grey goo  129 130beginning after 2000 a growing number of scientists philosophers and tech billionaires created organizations devoted to studying global risks both inside and outside of academia 131independent nongovernmental organizations ngos include the machine intelligence research institute est 2000 which aims to reduce the risk of a catastrophe caused by artificial intelligence and the singularity 132 the top donors include peter thiel and jed mc caleb 133 the lifeboat foundation est 2009 funds research into preventing a technological catastrophe 134 most of the research money funds projects at universities 135 the global catastrophic risk institute est 2011 is a think tank for all things catastrophic risk it is funded by the ngo social and environmental entrepreneurs the global challenges foundation est 2012 based in stockholm and founded by laszlo szombatfalvy releases a yearly report on the state of global risks 14 15 the future of life institute est 2014 aims to support research and initiatives for safeguarding life considering new technologies and challenges facing humanity 136 elon musk is one of its biggest donors 137 the nuclear threat initiative seeks to reduce global threats from nuclear biological and chemical threats and containment of damage after an event 138 it maintains a nuclear material security index 139universitybased organizations include the future of humanity institute est 2005 which researches the questions of humanitys longterm future particularly existential risk it was founded by nick bostrom and is based at oxford university the centre for the study of existential risk est 2012 is a cambridgebased organization which studies four major technological risks artificial intelligence biotechnology global warming and warfare all are manmade risks as huw price explained to the afp news agency it seems a reasonable prediction that some time in this or the next century intelligence will escape from the constraints of biology he added that when this happens were no longer the smartest things around and will risk being at the mercy of machines that are not malicious but machines whose interests dont include us 140stephen hawking is an acting adviser the millennium alliance for humanity and the biosphere is a stanford universitybased organization focusing on many issues related to global catastrophe by bringing together members of academic in the humanities 141 142 it was founded by paul ehrlich among others 143 stanford university also has the center for international security and cooperation focusing on political cooperation to reduce global catastrophic risk 144other risk assessment groups are based in or are part of governmental organizations the world health organization who includes a division called the global alert and response gar which monitors and responds to global epidemic crisis 145 gar helps member states with training and coordination of response to epidemics 146 the united states agency for international development usaid has its emerging pandemic threats program which aims to prevent and contain naturally generated pandemics at their source 147 the lawrence livermore national laboratory has a division called the global security principal directorate which researches on behalf of the government issues such as biosecurity counterterrorism etc 148see also  editextinction portal
