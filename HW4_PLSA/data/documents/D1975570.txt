the federal advisory committee act faca 5 u s c app 2 governs the process whereby the president or an administrative agency obtains advice from groups that include one or more nonfederal employees it places various limits on the formation of such groups and requires that group meetings be open to public attendance and permit at least a limited degree of public participation though congress has occasionally amended faca 1 the original framework of the 1972 act has essentially remained intact to the present day nevertheless faca has faced criticism with some contending that the act imposes excessive procedural burdens and others arguing that it does not require agencies to do enough to promote openness and transparency this recommendation offers proposals to congress the general services administration gsa and agencies that use advisory committees to alleviate certain procedural burdens associated with the existing regime clarify the scope of the act and enhance the transparency and objectivity of the advisory committee process overview of facacongress the president and administrative agencies each can create advisory committees advisory committees are classified as either “discretionary” or “nondiscretionary” “discretionary” advisory committees include those that an agency forms of its own initiative or in response to a statute authorizing the creation of a committee 2 “nondiscretionary” advisory committees include those formed by the president and those that congress by statute specifically directs the president or an agency to establish 3faca furthers three major goals first the act promotes transparency and public participation in the advisory committee process providing for open meetings and permitting interested members of the public to submit written andor oral comments to advisory committees 4 second the act seeks to ensure objective advice and limit the influence of special interests on advisory committees by requiring that the membership of an advisory committee “be fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee” 5 third the act seeks to preserve federal resources by requiring justifications for any new committees and periodic review of existing committees to ensure that they continue to serve a useful purpose 6in order to trigger faca an assemblage of individuals must include at least one nonfederal employee as well as meet the following requirements a work as a group b be “established” by statute or “established or utilized” by the president or an administrative agency and c provide “advice or recommendations” to the president or a federal agency 7 the courts have held that certain types of interactions do not meet this threshold for triggering faca specifically courts have held that a assemblages of persons providing advice to the government individually are not “groups” subject to faca 8 b groups formed by private contractors that are not subject to direct management or control by an administrative agency are not “utilized” by the agency so as to trigger faca 9 c subcommittees that report to a parent committee are not subject to faca’s open meeting requirements since the subcommittee does not itself provide “advice or recommendations” to the agency 10 and d groups in which the nongovernment members lack a formal vote or veto over the “advice or recommendations” the committee ultimately provides do not implicate faca 11all advisory committees subject to faca must comply with a number of procedural requirements 12 prior to the committee’s commencing its work an agency creating a discretionary committee must consult with the general services administration gsa regarding the need for the proposed committee and all committees must have a charter setting forth the committee’s mission 13 the members selected to serve on the proposed committee must reflect an appropriate balance of the points of view and fields of expertise relevant to the committee’s work 14 faca only requires that committees achieve balance on factors specifically relevant to the committee’s work but a number of agencies have adopted policies of achieving balance on additional factors committee members selected to provide individual expert advice are appointed as “special government employees” sges and must comply with ethics requirements similar to those applicable to regular government employees whereas members chosen to represent a particular interest group with a stake in the committee’s work are appointed as “representatives” and are not subject to ethics requirements 15 once a committee is formed the agency must announce any committee meetings in advance in the federal register permit interested members of the public to attend such meetings 16 and receive comments from individuals interested in the committee’s work 17 the public upon request must be given access to all documents presented to or prepared for or by the advisory committee 18 finally agencies must recharter each existing committee every two years and as part of that process show that the committee has continued relevance and that the costs of its continued existence do not outweigh the benefits it provides 19agencies are also subject to executive order 12838 issued by president clinton in 1993 which required agencies to reduce the number of their discretionary advisory committees by onethird 20 the office of management  budget then issued circular a135 which capped the number of agency discretionary committees at the reduced levels permitted by the executive order 21 administrative agencies collectively can maintain a total of 534 discretionary advisory committees without exceeding the cap in certain instances agencies may wish to form advisory committees consisting of representatives from different stakeholder communities to negotiate the text of a proposed rule 22 congress has specifically authorized this process known as “negotiated rulemaking” in the negotiated rulemaking act of 1990 23 in most instances negotiated rulemaking committees are subject to faca 24 except as modified by the negotiated rulemaking act or another statute the negotiated rulemaking act provides some of the same protections as faca requiring that the agency make certain findings regarding the need for a negotiated rulemaking committee 25 and that negotiated rulemaking committees be balanced to include representatives from all relevant stakeholder communities 26 however requirements pertaining to notices and openness of meetings stem from faca rather than from the negotiated rulemaking act research methodology both governmental agencies and private groups have criticized the existing faca regime many agencies contend that it is overly cumbersome and limits their ability to obtain outside advice numerous private groups have argued that the statute does not adequately promote transparency or preserve a role for the public to participate in the work of committees congress has also recently proposed various reforms to faca that would as a general matter extend the scope of the act and require agencies to undertake various steps to increase transparency in their use of advisory committees 27 in light of the recent interest expressed in reforming faca study of the act is timely in order to identify the problems driving these concerns and formulate potential solutions the conference undertook an extensive study seeking input from individuals and groups within and outside of the federal government the datagathering effort included a two separate surveys with one focusing on agency committee management officers cmos who are responsible for compliance with faca and the other focusing on “clients” of advisory committees such as agency program officers and general counsel’s offices b a workshop with approximately 50 participants including numerous agency representatives with extensive experience in the use of advisory committees and members of nongovernmental organizations that promote government transparency and c dozens of interviews of faca experts not limited to cmos both within and outside of the federal government research results the data gathered suggest that faca andor its implementation by administrative agencies has given rise to at least three types of problems 1 procedural burdens that inhibit the effective use of advisory committees without substantially furthering the policies of the act 2 confusion about the scope of the statute that may discourage agencies from using committees or induce them to engage in “workarounds” to avoid triggering its requirements and 3 agency practices that either undermine or fail to fully promote the transparency and objectivity of the advisory committee process the recommendations below propose reforms to address these problems the first group of recommendations seeks to alleviate barriers and perceived barriers 28 to the government’s use of advisory committees by proposing a simplified process by which agencies create advisory committees and select their members and by recommending the removal of the arbitrary cap on the number of advisory committees 29the second set of recommendations seeks to clarify the act’s scope in light of cases interpreting the act and in anticipation of congressional amendments recently under consideration that might inhibit agencies’ use of advisory committees or lead to use of alternative procedures to avoid triggering the act one such amendment would require subcommittees to comply with all provisions of faca other than chartering including the open meeting requirements 30 the conference recommends that if congress eliminates the subcommittee exemption then it should codify what is currently a regulatory exemption allowing agencies to conduct preparatory work in closed meetings without a requirement of advance public notice 31 the conference also recommends that gsa clarify the act’s applicability to “virtual meetings” conducted via web forum to ensure that agencies are not chilled from using this technique and that congress clarify the applicability of faca principles to negotiated rulemaking committees the third set of recommendations proposes that both congress and agencies adopt certain procedures that would enhance the transparency and objectivity of the advisory committee process without imposing onerous procedural or financial burdens on the agencies these include “best practices” related to committee formation and operation such as posting committee documents online webcasting committee meetings and soliciting input on potential committee members and recommendations related to the classification of committee members for purposes of applying ethics standards recommendationalleviating procedural burdens that inhibit the effective use of advisory committees1 congress should amend the federal advisory committee act “faca” and the general services administration “gsa” should amend its faca implementing regulations to eliminate any requirement that agencies consult with the administrator of gsa prior to forming or renewing an advisory committee or implementing a major change to the charter of an existing committee specifically congress should delete the phrase “after consultation with the administrator” from section 9 a 2 of faca and gsa should eliminate or suitably revise 41 c f r §§ 102360 102385 a which currently require such consultation with gsa’s committee management secretariat 32 agencies should still be required to prepare and file committee charters and should be permitted but not required to consult with gsa to obtain advice regarding preparation of the charter or other aspects of committee formation agencies should also still be required to file charters as under current law 33 including filing with gsa for informational purposes and for inclusion in the faca database gsa should continue to post all committee charters online2 agencies should identify and prioritize those factors for achieving balance among committee members that are directly relevant to the subject matter and purpose of the committee’s work the committee charter should include a description of the committee’s mission and the most relevant balance factors3 whenever congress creates an advisory committee through legislation it should indicate its intent as to the mission estimated duration budget and preferred membership balance for the committee whenever such committees are exempted from the biennial review process congress should provide guidance concerning the intended duration of each such committee or alternatively a clear explanation of the committee’s mission and a provision that the committee should terminate upon completion of that mission4 the president and the office of management and budget should eliminate the cap on the number of discretionary advisory committees established by executive order 12838 and circular a135 clarifying the scope of faca5 congress should not eliminate the exemption for subcommittees that report to parent committees currently stated in 41 c f r § 102335 unless it codifies an exemption providing that members of committees or subcommittees may meet to conduct “preparatory work” without complying with the notice and open meeting requirements of the act the statutory definition of “preparatory work” should be similar to that currently provided in faca’s implementing regulations at 41 c f r § 1023160 a congress andor gsa should also consider including a clearer list of activities that constitute “preparatory work” than that currently contained in the implementing regulations including activities such as i drafting documents for consideration at a committee meeting ii conducting research or preliminary analysis on topics for discussion at a committee meeting iii engaging in predecisional deliberations iv choosing meeting topics and v considering future projects for the committee to undertake6 gsa should amend section 1023140 e of the faca implementing regulations to clarify that in addition to holding teleconferenced or webconferenced meetings agencies also may host virtual meetings that can occur electronically in writing over the course of days weeks or months on a moderated publicly accessible web forum agencies with advisory committees should be aware that they have the option of holding committee meetings via such online forums to the extent they conduct meetings by web forum agencies should monitor the process and determine whether it is an efficient and transparent means of hosting meetings7 congress should amend the negotiated rulemaking act 5 u s c § 561 et seq to provide that committees engaged in negotiated rulemaking are exempt from faca but that such committees should be required to announce full committee meetings in advance and open them to public attendance the amendments should codify existing procedures that allow caucuses or other subgroups of committee members to meet privately provided that such caucuses or subgroups make no final decisions on behalf of the full committee in the event that congress does eliminate the faca exemption applicable to subcommittees of advisory committees 41 c f r § 102335 but does not exempt negotiated rulemaking committees from faca it should create a carveout allowing negotiated rulemaking caucuses or other subgroups to continue to hold meetings privately so long as they do not make final decisions on behalf of the full committee enhancing transparency and objectivity8 congress and agencies should adopt the following procedures with respect to the ethics requirements applicable to advisory committee members a in creating statutory advisory committees congress should specify the intended classification of committee members for purposes of applying federal ethics laws congress should explicitly classify as “representatives” not subject to ethics standards those members who are selected to represent the perspective or interests of a particular group with a stake in the work of the advisory committee it should explicitly classify as “special government employees” sges subject to specified federal ethics laws and rules members who are chosen to provide individual independent expert advice b congress and individual agencies should prevent misuse of the “representative” designation by limiting it to individuals selected to represent some entity or group with a stake in the committee’s work and should not apply that designation to persons who by virtue of their expertise might be said to “represent” a field of study or discipline but do not represent the views of a particular interest group such members are more appropriately classified as sges 34 c agencies that grant conflict of interest waivers under 18 u s c § 208 b should post such waivers on their websites without awaiting a public request for releasing them 35 agencies should make appropriate provisions for redacting from such waivers information that they may keep confidential pursuant to 18 u s c § 208 d 19 agencies should post on a committee website documents “which were made available to or prepared for or by each advisory committee” ie documents that must be made publicly available on request under section 10 b of faca and that reflect the substantive work of the committee agencies should attempt to post documents relevant to upcoming meetings eg draft reports recommendations or meeting agendas as early as possible in advance of the meeting to which they relate and other materials that document the events of past meetings eg minutes or transcripts as quickly after the meeting as possible10 agencies should provide live webcasts of open committee meetings andor post recordings following such meetings unless the costs are prohibitive when selecting a webcasting technology agencies should assess the likely level of public interest in their committees’ work the cost of different technologies as well as the cost savings such technologies can create and their available resources 3611 upon creating a new advisory committee agencies should announce the committee’s mission in the federal register andor on the agencies’ website and invite nominations for potential committee members from the public from expert communities with experience in the subject matter of the committee’s assignment andor from groups especially likely to be affected by the committee’s work
