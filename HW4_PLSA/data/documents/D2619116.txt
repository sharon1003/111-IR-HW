completing your site design and development you re ready to publish the results publishing puts your site on a ftp sftp or web dav server so you and others can see it using a browser the net objects fusion publishing process generates html files for the sites pages and associated assets net objects fusion transfers the generated html files to the server you use for web hosting you can control the location of your site directing net objects fusion to save it to a local disk drive so only you can see it or to a remote server so others can see it too when you re sure the site is ready for the web you publish it to a web server so everyone in the world can visit your site sites published with net objects fusion work with any web server on any operating platform no special webserver extensions are required if your site contains special components also installed on the server including net objects fusion form handler cgi scripts or thirdparty components it requires extra steps to set up to publish on a server the publishing process the net objects fusion publishing process involves two basic steps generating html files and then transferring the generated html files to the web server when you select publish site net objects fusion converts your site into html pages and associated assets using the site structure page design content links and assets information in the sitenamenod file these generated html files are used by browsers to display your website you specify where the generated html files are saved a typical scenario is to publish the html files locally onto your computers hard disk where you can then open run and test the site in your browser without connecting to the internet when the site is exactly right you re ready to transfer it to a web server selecting transfer files to server from the publish menu copies the locally published html files to the server you use for web access to speed the transfer process net objects fusion uses its own builtin ftp program you must use net objects net objects fusion to transfer your sites html and asset files from one location to another you cannot move generated html files from one location to another nor can you rename the files in windows explorer renaming the files or moving them to a new location breaks links because the file locations are different from those specified in the generated html files net objects fusion s default publish setting local publish is preconfigured to publish the html files on your local disk you do not have to do additional setup however when you re ready to publish to a remote web server you must set up a publish profile for your isps web server you can create as many publish profiles as you need but you can only log on to one server at a time if you re working on a companys intranet and want a few site visitors to test the site before you transfer it to the internet you can publish the html files to one or more private intranet servers then when its ready to share with the world you can publish the site directly to your companys web server additional publishing notes sites published with net objects fusion work with any web server on any operating platform no special web server extensions are required when you republish your site for example to update pages or add new information net objects fusion overwrites existing files as needed you can also remove old files or obsolete assets from local or remote directories by selecting viewdelete server contents from the publish menu net objects fusion does not automatically publish through firewalls or to proxy servers see publishing with firewalls or proxy servers if net objects fusion has difficulty storing your site on a remote web server make sure your system is online and has a valid connection to your network or the internet make sure the server is not down or offline make sure your publish profile settings are correct test the remote server account name and password settings displayed in the publish settings dialog by using them to log on to the server using a separate ftp or telnet application make sure your account has the appropriate permissions and that sufficient storage space for your site is available on the server if your company uses a proxy server or has established firewalls for security make sure the server settings are appropriate for the proxy or firewall if you define publishing settings for a site and then export that site as a template those settings travel with the template if you are sharing a template with colleagues who can use the same publish settings you can save time by configuring the publish settings in advance exporting them with a template and then distributing the template you have the ability to keep track of your sites visitors using the site traffic option available in net objects fusion  this service is provided by google analytics you will be provided with periodical tracking statistics of your site see setting site traffic options exploring publish view you use net objects fusion publish view to publish a site publish view looks similar to microsoft windows explorer or windows nt file manager the local view presents a representation of the file structure that will be created when you publish your site it does not represent the existing structure for your site on your hard disk or server therefore changing the directory structure in publish view does not affect the page relationships in site view and likewise changing the page relationships in site view does not affect the representation in publish view changes that you make to the directory structure in publish view only affect your sites current directory structure when you publish your site the dropdown list in the local view displays the directory structure of your site as it will be published on your server click a directorys plus sign to expand the display to show the subdirectories beneath it click a directorys minus sign to collapse the display and hide the subdirectories beneath it or click the folder next to the dropdown box to navigate up one level the remote view on the right displays the contents of the remote directory you are currently connected to if you are not connected to a remote server you will see dropdown list of available remote profiles you can delete rearrange or rename the directories shown in the local and remote panes and you can create new subdirectories at any level below the root locked components and their related assets signified by a black lock image on their icons cannot be renamed or rearranged for each local and remote directory page or asset displayed the local and remote pane displays its name type attributes and the date and time of the last local and remote publish or modification you can sort the content files and folders by clicking a column heading and you can resize the columns by dragging the column heading border the icons associated with different file types are set in the windows file types registry publishing locally while developing a site you should publish it at least once to your local hard disk to check that the site works as intended after the site is published to your hard disk net objects fusion launches your browser so you can view the site and see how it will appear to site visitors on the web if after publishing the site to your hard disk you make changes to the site in net objects fusion republish the site depending on the complexity of the site you may publish several times to get the site working as desired then when the site works perfectly publish it to your web server or isp server so everyone in the world can appreciate your handiwork setting up to publish locally in publish view click the settings button on the views bar the publish settings dialog appears in the server dropdown list choose localnetwork check the folder name by default net objects fusion preconfigures the local location to documents and settings user my documentsnet objects fusionuser sites sitename local publish also make sure the local disk drive has sufficient space for your publishedsite files if you want to publish the site to a different directory do one of the following enter the drive and directory path you want to use this path can point to an existing directory or create a new directory to publish to a different machine on your local network create a new local publish profile and browse to that machine click browse and select the folder you want to use or create a new folder to create a new folder select the folder in the browse dialog in which you want to create the new folder then click ok enter the name of the new folder at the end of the path in the directory field to prevent your sites html files from getting mixed in with other files you should always use an empty directory the first time you save the files click advanced publish settings select the options for your sites pages home page file name index is the default page name recognized by most web servers select current page name to set the home page to use the same name as in site view select home or default to set the page as in homehtml and defaulthtml file extension for html pages select htm html or shtml depending on the page extension your browser recognizes click the browse button to enter a page extension that is not available in the dropdown list make sure you use a page extension that your browser recognizes or it might not display the page properly if you used the custom names dialog in site view to assign a file name extension for an individual page that customized extension overrides the site default for that page click close setting html options net objects fusion includes a variety of options to control html format and generation in any view from the tools menu choose options  current site the current site options dialog appears on the general tab click html options the html options dialog appears set the html formatting options these settings do not affect the appearance of your site the settings only affect the html code that is created when you publish the site indentation select tabs or a specific number of spaces to indent lines of the code so it is easier to read maximum compression select this option if you do not want site visitors to easily read your html code if this option is selected line breaks tabs and unnecessary spaces that make the code more readable are stripped from the generated html code the generated html code uses as few characters as possible and the code will be unintelligible to restore compressed code so you can read it clear this option and republish the site line breaks choose pcunix or mac to set the line breaks in the code for the platform you expect to use to view the code your choice of line breaks does not affect the browsers interpretation of the code regardless of the computer platform being used to view your site word wrap select the number of characters per line of code before it wraps to the next line this option enhances readability of the html code in text editors that do not automatically wrap text however this can cause text to wrap in the middle of an html tag which prevents the code from working properly and for some java script code you may need to deselect this option so the lines do not wrap html tags select whether the html tags are in uppercase or lowercase such as h1 or h1 in the generated html code attributes select whether the tag attributes are in uppercase or lowercase such as bgcolor or bgcolor in the generated html code generate nofspecific attributes the additional code generated does not meet html 401 standards encode external links select this option if you want net objects fusion to encode the external links that are used in your project use transparent gif as spacer select this option if you want net objects fusion to use a transparent gif named clearpixelgif to space items accurately on a page if you generate tables on a page net objects fusion places invisible image files of varying widths and heights in the table cells to ensure accurate placement of objects include html comments select this option to insert comments into your generated html code that makes reading it easier for example with this option selected the comment  start of the body for this page  appears before the body tag include character set meta tag select this option to include the character set for the site in the meta tag of each page normally you only use this option if your site uses a nonwestern character set background image offset select this option to compensate for the small borders most browsers add to the top and left sides of their windows by selecting this option you can shift the image in net objects fusion so the page content starts in the upper left corner of the page enter values in the top and left boxes to offset the background image click ok when you finish selecting html options setting up to transfer files to your web server to put your site on the web you must transfer its html files and related asset files from your computers local hard disk to a server that has access to the web this can be an isp server that you use to access the web your companys web server or any other server that gives you internet access net objects fusion uses the ftp process to transfer your sites files to the web server therefore to transfer to a remote web server your computer must connect using the ftp protocol unless that remote server is on your company lan in which case you can use the local publish option prior to transferring to the server the first time however you must set up a profile of the server to receive the transferred html files the setup for a web server also applies to an intranet server if you ll transfer a site from your hard disk to your companys intranet server prior to transferring to the web server use the setup steps in this section for both your intranet server and web server the server setup process to set up a server you select transfer options and define a profile after you select the appropriate options you don t have to select them again you just transfer the site from your hard disk to the server s if you change servers you must select options and define a publish profile for the new server the setup process consists of selecting the directory structure defining the server profile and selecting publish components if necessary these settings are saved in your sitename nod file so you dont have to create a publish profile each time you want to publish the site when setup is complete you can transfer the files from a local directory to the remote servers location publish profile checklist make sure you can answer the questions in the following checklist before you create a publish profile for a remote server who is your service provider this is the business organization or department that is going to store your site on its server and provide your site visitors access to it on the web the technical support staff of your service provider should be able to provide the answers to the rest of these questions service providers and other organizations that provide hosting services often offer technical support pages on their own websites what is the name of your ftp host this is the name of the server that you are going to publish your site to it might be the same as your domain name such as www yourname com a name assigned by the service provider such as inbox isp com or a specific ip address a series of four numbers separated by periods what is your directory when you log on to your remote host you automatically begin in the home directory for your login account this might not be the right place to put your site however for a variety of reasons you might need to publish your site in a subdirectory of your home directory you must know the relative path from your accounts home directory to the base directory where your site should be stored when net objects fusion publishes your site and logs on to your service provider it stores your sites pages and assets in this base directory you enter this path statement as the directory in the publish settings dialog you can create a new base directory below your initial base directory to publish and test a site without disturbing your existing site for example if the base directory is  sitename  you can create a new base directory as  sitename test and then run the site from that base directory to test it however the host and base directory might not look anything like the url that your site visitors use to access your site for security and other reasons hosting services frequently name their host machines and user directories according to their own needs if you have your own domain such as www mycompany com and are logging in directly to the account that owns that domain you might not need to specify a base directory because the home directory of that account might be the same location as the base directory what is the user name and password for your account you need this information so net objects fusion can log on to the server and publish your site what is the preferred name for the default home page your service provider determines what file name the server displays by default for each directory on the server most servers are configured to display by default any file named index others default to home or default you must match this preferred name in the advanced publish settings dialog for remote server transfer what html file name extension does your server support web page servers typically support html htm or shtml as file name extensions some service providers map one to the other so the server recognizes all of them others require you to use a specific one you must set the advanced publish settings dialog so net objects fusion transfers files with the correct extension you can also enter a custom extension if your server supports it is a specific port required for upload the service provider or hosting service might have designated a specific port on the server that it wants you to use to upload files if so you must specify this for net objects fusion see setting the server port and permissions does your login account have the necessary permissions servers use permission configurations to control what you are allowed to do while logged on whether you can delete files for example or create new directories in publish view you can specify the file and directory structure that you want net objects fusion to create or use for your site by selecting arrange files from the publish menu your login account which net objects fusion uses to store the files must have the server permissions necessary to create the directory structure you defined if your service provider does not let you create directories then you must use the flat directory structure option to transfer and store your site how much server space do you have before you publish your site to the web server check the size of the generated html files on your hard disk the default location for the files is a folder named user sites sitename local publish make sure you include all the subfolders as well check that the space allocated on the web server can accommodate all the files in the local publish folder does your server have security systems in place such as proxies or firewalls firewalls and proxy servers can prevent net objects fusion from uploading files properly see publishing with firewalls or proxy servers select the directory structure many isps hosting companies and web servers require website files to be arranged in a certain directory structure net objects fusion supports the three most popular directory structures used by isps and web servers but you should check with your service provider to determine which structure to use if your isp or web server has special requirements for a sites directory structure you can customize the site directory structure in publish view see customizing your sites directory structure for information when you publish your site to a web server you control the directory structure of your files and assets on the server setting the directory structure for your site does not change the structure that the site visitor sees nor does it affect the links between pages and assets it simply specifies the path names where your pages and assets are stored on the server and what url is required to access them for example some servers require a onelevel structure with all pages images and other assets in the same directory others let you set up your own directories net objects fusion provides three preconfigured directory structures flat for servers that require all resources and assets to be in a single directory many commercial isps and hosting companies require this kind of structure asset type arranges your site contents into folders according to their asset type this is the default setting in net objects fusion  for example if your site contains a typical mix of text and media a structure set by asset type arranges your contents into the structure shown below site structure arranges your site contents into a directory arrangement that looks like your site in site view your home page and its assets are stored in the sites root directory each firstlevel page is stored in its own folder with its assets any child page is stored with its assets in a subfolder beneath the folder that contains its parent page you determine the maximum number of subfolders by setting the number of levels option for example a structure set with the by site structure option would have this directory arrangement on the server the site structure setting creates an efficient file structure allowing the server to load your pages quickly in a site visitors browser it also provides an effective directory structure for search engines which might index only one page per folder if you apply the site structure setting shared assets are stored in the deepest folder common to all pages that use that asset this makes the shared access to those assets as efficient as possible to set the directory structure for a site in publish view from the publish menu choose arrange files choose by site structure by asset type or by flat if you want to customize the structure select the option that produces the structure similar to the one youll create see customizing your sites directory structure  if you choose site structure a dialog appears so you can set the number of levels of subdirectories for your site if site structure is already selected choose it again to see this dialog and set the levels click the up and down arrows in the dialog to set the number of levels click ok if you customized the directory structure but want to reset it to one of the menu options choose clear all customizations the directory structure is reset to the option currently selected on the arrange files menu net objects fusion removes custom folders and changes all customized asset names back to the original names click yes to accept the new structure the directory structure is revised and displayed in publish view define server profiles each web server has a name and a set of properties that define the connection settings net objects fusion uses to publish your site to that location and server you can select a server or set its properties any time before you publish the publish profile is stored in the sitename nod file net objects fusion includes one default server profile local publish which is your local hard disk in the documents and settings user my documentsnet objects fusionuser sites sitename local publish directory see setting up to publish locally to modify the settings for publishing to your local hard disk you can modify the default profile create your own or delete unneeded profiles you can also create a global copy of a profile which makes the profile available across different sites the information needed to connect to a remote server is specific to your server contact your isp hosting company or web server administrator for the precise information to enter in these fields for guidance on the questions you need to ask see publish profile checklist  to define a remote server profile in publish view click settings on the views bar the publish settings dialog appears it is the same dialog you used to set up your local publish profile click new a new profile will appear in the list box select one of the following server types ftp file transfer protocol protocol that allows users to transfer files from one computer to another over the internet sftp secure file transfer protocol secure version of the ftp protocol sftp uses ssl to encrypt the entire user session thereby protecting the contents of the files and the users login name and password from outside sources web dav set of extensions to the http protocol which allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers although many isps and hosting companies use a single server to receive ftp files and provide web hosting the service you use may have separate servers for receiving ftp files and web hosting select the ftp server to receive your transferred files check with your isp administrator for the correct server to select to receive your files enter a name that identifies the server in the profile name box or use the default name enter information in each field in the attributes section server is the name or ip number you use to connect to the remote server this can be your sites domain name the name of an intranet server or the name of your isps server confirm this information with your isp administrator or server administrator directory is the location on the remote server where your sites html files are stored leave this field blank if your sites home page should be stored in the home directory of the user id or server account that you use to transfer your site to a remote server if you want your sites home page to be stored in a different directory than the home directory enter the path to the home page here such as publichtmluser  for more information about the directory setting see publish profile checklist  user name is the name you use to log on to the remote server so you can transfer files to it password is the password that authorizes you to access the server to publish to the remote server you need server permissions for adding files and creating directories if you do not enter a password in this box a dialog appears when you publish the site you enter the password in that dialog you can also select an option for net objects fusion to remember your password so you don t have to manually enter it each time you publish files live url is the url on which the home page will be published if you fill in the live url field with your home page url then when you have completed publishing remotely and your site is in place your browser will open so that you can examine the results if you leave the live url field blank the browser will not open in this situation after publishing your site remotely you will need to open the browser yourself and type the url of your home page create a site map for search engines option offers you the possibility to create a map of your sites urls when you publish your site remotely this option is disabled and it will become available only after you specify your home page url in the live url field if you enable this option a site map for search engines will be created on the published site click advanced to specify publish settings advanced options are not available for web dav profiles select the options for your site home page file name index is the default page name recognized by most web servers select current page name to set the home page to use the same name as in site view select home or default to set the page as in homehtml and defaulthtml file extension for html pages select htm html or shtml depending on the page extension your browser recognizes that extension is applied to all html files for each page in your site click the up and down arrows to see all the options to add an extension to the list click the browse button your service provider or hosting company can tell you which extension to use for the web server make sure you use a page extension that your browser recognizes or it might not display the page properly if you used the custom name dialog in site view and a file name extension for an individual page that customized extension overrides the site default for that page if pages do not seem to publish with the correct extension custom names that you applied to the pages may be incorrect check the names of the affected pages the aliases and advanced sftp tabs are for advanced setup options
