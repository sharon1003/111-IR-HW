other royals 19th january 2013why is prince edward an earl not a duke guest posts royal central share tweet pin royal tourism telegraph newspaper slams beatrice  eugenie “they make a laughing stock of us all”photo credit northern ireland office via flickr in any royal commentator’s books the announcement in 1999 that prince edward would be made an earl and not a duke on his wedding day gave quite a shock by tradition male children of the sovereign receive a dukedom on their wedding day therefore making their new wife the duchess of x rather than the slightly more confusing ‘hrh princess michael of kent’ as happened for prince michael’s wife prince edward is the youngest of the queen’s children he is automatically ‘hrh the prince edward’ by birth and any other titles come affixed to that the title of earl ranks below duke below prince and below marquess though marquess is never used as a royal title it is said that prince edward chose the title of earl of wessex because of its connotations with one of edward’s favourite films shakespeare in love in it featured a character with the title of earl of wessex it could have been worse for edward and sophie he could have been given no title like the aforementioned prince and princess michael of kent making sophie ‘her royal highness the princess edward’ or in shorter reference ‘princess edward’ but all this still doesn’t answer why edward wasn’t made a duke even one of the queen’s grandchildren was made a duke of cambridge so why not prince edward this was according to official sources because one day when prince philip dies prince edward will get the title of duke of edinburgh in order to continue the present duke’s work despite this claim and assurance that this will happen due to succession to titles laws it won’t be direct and under some circumstances may not happenultimately prince philip will have to die in order for prince edward to receive the dukedom of edinburgh but it’s not quite as simple as the succession to the crown where it passes straight to the nextinline in fact – by default prince charles will inherit the title of duke of edinburgh and if he is king at time the title will merge with the crown if he is not king the queen will be able to reissue the title to complicate matters further if charles is on the throne he doesn’t have to issue the title to edward nor does her present majesty the crown is at liberty to do as wished with the title – it could even be given to another member of the royal family despite this we think that they’ll stick to the promise of making prince edward duke of edinburgh plus this would mean that by courtesy prince edward’s son james would become earl of wessex and instead of being ‘james viscount severn’ would be ‘james earl of wessex’ – lady louise’s title wouldn’t change – sophie’s title would become ‘hrh the duchess of edinburgh’ royal titles in great britain from highest to lowest male title female title duke duchess prince princess

beloved lady louise will have no royal particularly as little james always looks so miserable and lady louise is so merrydenise maguire • 10 months ago she is a royal the earl declined the hrh title for her so she is titled as a child of an earl i believe anne did the same thing when her kids were born debra • 5 months ago annes husband declined the offer of an earldom that was the only way her children would have had titles unless the queen issued letters patent allowing her children to be hrhs which would be unprecedented for a female that wasnt going to ascend the thronedenise maguire • 10 months agoawesomekiwi • 1 year ago prince michael of kent is not a royal duke because he is a younger not older son of one his older brother prince edward of kent inherited the title duke of kent from their father who was the son of king george v it is only the sons of the sovereign who are granted royal dukedoms on marriage  not generally the grandsons although this was done for prince william on marriage because he is in direct line to the throne and otherwise his children  who are also in direct line  would not have a princely title as the younger son prince michael simply retained the title he was born with and his wife became princess michael but to complicate things sophie countess of wessex actually is also known as princess edward  just as the duchess of cambridge also counts princess william among her titles and the duchess of cornwall is also princess charles and sara ferguson was princess andrew as well as duchess of york unless they are actually born into the royal family women do not become princesses in their own name  not even the late princess of wales even though she was often mistakenly called princess dianaadam • 5 years ago prince is higher the duke royal central • 5 years ago an aristocratic duke ranks below prince but a royal duke ranks abovenora miller • 1 year ago i dont understand the differencedenise maguire • 10 months agoa royal duke is in line of the throne a regular duke is higher than earl but lower than a prince rook star • 1 year ago the article said a prince becomes a duke when he gets married to a female making the female the duchess normally the performance of an act which results in a higher station makes that station chief to the previous station which all goes without saying of course but your question seemed to demand a thorough accounting of the facts the prince is married and becomes a duke this makes the royal title of duke higher than that of prince but ah im just a stupid american mind you denise maguire • 10 months ago that is not completely true and we know this because edward is an earl there is no requirement on the queen to grant a title to any of her family married or not rook star • 10 months ago i meant about titles not specific people a prince becoming a duke by logic makes duke a superior qualifier to the title of prince as the editor points out an aristocratic duke ranks below prince but a royal duke ranks abovewhat that says to me is that a duke by birth is lesser than a duke by ascension james white • 5 months ago which is fascinating when you consider that in 1955 winston churchill who of course had royal family connections to the stuarts was offered a dukedom he declined but could have been the first duke of london which was the title offered but i suppose that he would have been a newly created aristocratic duke being elevated from political title to the highest possible title for a commoner to hold he wasnt an ascending prince it was still a remarkable offer as it happened no dukes have been created outside the royal family since 1900 duke k • 4 months ago it was a toss up between the duke of dover and the duke of london bisto • 2 years ago the dukedom of edinburgh and all other scottish titles should die out when scotland becomes independentmatt227 • 1 year ago it would be up to the scottish parliament whether to declare a republic to continue as a constitutional monarchy and whether to abolish or continue the scottish peerage the british royal family is still descended from medieval kings through the scottish stuarts james i moved from edinburgh to london not the other way around so elizabeth is very much the queen of scotland as much as she is of england and wales bisto • 1 year ago dont disagree with you for one minute matt love your cartoons in the telegraph by the way but a wastrel like jedward is unfit to carry such a title it would be an insult to the people of scotland the title should die out with prince philip if it goes to anybody it should be harryrook star • 1 year ago jedward please explain bisto • 1 year ago whats the point we are not being allowed to comment on anything else or hadnt you noticed oh and edward is as big a joke as the popduo jedwarddouglas sutherlandbruce • 5 months ago there was some talk of asking the princess royal to become scotlands monarch if the breakaway happened david perceval • 1 month ago can an aristocratic title of prince be bestowed in uk i mean not a royal title  i dont think so since apparently there never any principalities in uk except for wales  james peters • 5 months ago his other tile is dockside doris queen of plymouth and all surrounding portschloeross3 • 10 months ago snowden was made earl of snowden upon his marriage to hrh princess margaret who became countess and his son a viscount david linley is now the 2nd earl snowden his sister sarah is styled “lady” i have it that sophie of wessex disappointed she was not made duch when edward became earl of wessex but i presume it was done this way so he could inherit his father’s duchy as duke of edinburgh well that wore me out debrett’s has all the styles and titles jp • 1 year ago what is left for harry of wales on his wedding day   i was given the impression from your previous articles that he would be granted the dukedom of edinburgh upon the death of the current duke  confused much denise maguire • 10 months ago ive heard that he may be granted duke of sussex sarah • 1 year ago he has said he wants the dukedom of sussex celya723 • 5 months ago theres plenty of titles that can be resurrected for royals should they be requested and reasonable thats how pr charless wife ended up with hers and after she dies theyll once again become dormant as theyre granted to her exclusively upon the request of her husband for the duration of her life the contract details of that marriage and the origin and condition of her titles are very interesting debra • 5 months ago camilla has the female version of all of charles titles and chose to be styled as hrh the duchess of cornwall with the queens consent when charles ascends the throne william will immediately become the next duke of cornwall and catherine will be the duchess of cornwall as his wife they will be styled as trh the duke and duchess of cornwall and cambridge frits b • 3 months ago when charles becomes king william will surely be the next prince of wales as his designated successor at the same time george would be promoted to duke of cambridge celya723 • 5 months ago yes until charless 2nd marriage happened how his wife would be styled was of major interest until her titles were announced after their papers were approved by the queens council that overlooks these things im not the only person who learned something new about his other titles and their use until he wed again so william  catherine will inherit a new layer of grandeur to minister and hold in trust until georges turn comes about born2bwyld • 1 year ago so why wouldnt lady louise become hrh princess louise of edinburgh dont the duke of yorks daughters hold titles like that pb • 1 year ago lady louise is technically already a princess by letters patent issued in 1917 her parents decided they wanted her to be styled as lady louise astral planes • 3 years ago he was very seldom seen or photographed with the other children of the queen and there was speculation at the time that he was slow and the royal family kept it as quiet as they could denmom • 9 months ago it was my understanding that he embarrassed the royal family by dabbling in show business and a failed business venture it seems his father was more distressed over this than was the queendenise maguire • 10 months ago what are you referring to
