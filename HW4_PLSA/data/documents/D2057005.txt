on the manhattan project is fishing with colleagues when a large object crashes near the town of linda rosa at the impact site he meets sylvia van buren and her uncle pastor matthew collins later that night the cylinder opens and the inhabitants kill the three night guards at the site simultaneously shutting down all technology in the town with an electromagnetic pulse the united states marine corps surround the crash site in battle formation as reports pour in of identical objects landing all over the world and destroying cities pastor collins attempts to make peace with the martians before being disintegrated the martian war machines effortlessly defeat the military with both a  heatray  and skeleton beam attempting to escape by military spotter plane forrester and sylvia crash land and hide in an abandoned farm house they begin to develop closer feelings for each other just before the house is buried by yet another crashing cylinder they encounter and dismember an electronic eye on a long cable from a nearby hovering martian machine and collect a blood sample from a martian wounded by forrester with an axe while protecting sylvia they manage to escape unseen just before the farm house is obliterated many of the major world capitals are destroyed by martian attacks and the united states government makes the decision to drop the atomic bomb forrester brings the martian camera and blood samples to his team at pacific tech with hope of finding a way to defeat the invaders the attempt to destroy the martians with a nuclear bomb fails due to the integrity of their machines force shields forrester remains hopeful they can defeat the martians by studying the blood samples and finding a biological weakness as the martians advance on los angeles with nothing left to oppose them the city is evacuated and many of the inhabitants flee to the nearby mountains forrester sylvia and the pacific tech team are split apart by looters and their scientific equipment is stolen or destroyed forrester searches for sylvia in the city as the martians cause widespread destruction based on a story she had told him earlier he deduces that she would be hiding in a church after searching through several he finds sylvia among many praying survivors just as the martians strike the church their machines suddenly lose power and crash forrester finds one martian dying in its machine noting that they were all praying for a miracle  in voiceover the films narrator observes that while the martians were impervious to humanitys weapons they had no resistance to the bacteria in our atmosphere to which we have long since become immune once they had breathed our air germs which no longer affect us began to kill them the end came swiftly all over the world their machines began to stop and fall after all that men could do had failed the martians were destroyed and humanity was saved by the littlest things which god in his wisdom had put upon this earthcast

destructive technological advancements of earthly warfare from world war i through world war ii the image then smash cuts to vivid technicolor and the dramatic opening title card and credits which follow see title sequence section below the story then begins with a series of color matte paintings by astronomical artist chesley bonestell depicting the planets of our solar system all except venus  a narrator  sir cedric hardwicke offers a tour of the hostile environment of each world eventually explaining to the audience why the martians find our lush green and blue earth the only world worthy of their scrutiny and coming invasion 3 4this is the first of two adaptations of wells classic science fiction filmed by george pal it is considered to be one of the great science fiction films of the 1950s 5george pal originally planned for the final third of the film to be shot in the new 3d process to visually enhance the martians attack on los angeles the plan was dropped prior to actual production of the film presumably being deemed too expensive world war ii stock footage was used to produce a montage of destruction to show the worldwide invasion with armies of all nations joining together to fight the invaders 4dr forresters and the other scientists pacific tech pacific institute of technology has since been referenced in other films and television episodes whenever directorswritersproducers needed to depict a scienceoriented california university without using a specific institutions name 3the california city of corona was used as the shooting location of the fictitious town of linda rosa st brendans catholic church located at 310 south van ness avenue in los angeles was the setting used in the climactic scene where a large group of desperate people gather to pray the rolling hills and main thoroughfares of el sereno were also used in the film 3on the commentary track of the special collectors dvd edition of war of the worlds robinson and barry point out that the cartoon character woody woodpecker is seen in a tree top center screen when the first large martian meteoriteship crashes through the sky near the beginning of the film woodys creator walter lantz and george pal were close friends pal tried to always include the woody character out of friendship and good luck in his productions noted joe adamson years later walter had been close friends with pal ever since pal had left europe in advance of the war and arrived in hollywood 6a 1988 sequel was produced for a network television series of the same name differences from the wells novel  editas noted by caroline blake 7 the film is very different from the original novel in its attitude toward religion as reflected especially in the depiction of clergymen as characters the staunchly secularist wells depicted a cowardly and thoroughly uninspiring curate whom the narrator regards with disgust with which the reader is invited to concur in the film there is instead the sympathetic and heroic pastor collins who dies a martyrs death and then the films final scene in the church strongly emphasizing the divine nature of humanitys deliverance has no parallel in the original book pals adaptation has many other notable differences from h g wells novel the closest resemblance is probably that of the antagonists the films aliens are indeed martians and invade earth for the same reasons as those stated in the novel the state of mars suggests that it is in the final stages of being able to support life leading to the martians decision to make earth their new home they land in the same way by crashing to the earth however the novels spacecraft are large cylindershaped projectiles fired from the martian surface from some kind of cannon instead of the films meteoritespaceships but the martians emerge from their craft in the same way by unscrewing a large round hatch they appear to have no use for humans in the film in the novel however the invaders are observed feeding on humans by fatally transfusing their captives blood supply directly into martian bodies by using pipettes there is also a later speculation about the martians eventually using trained human slaves to hunt down all remaining survivors after they have conquered earth in the film the martians do not bring their fastgrowing red weed with them but they are defeated by earth microorganisms as observed in the novel however they die from the effects of the microorganisms within three days of the landing of the first meteoriteship in the novel the martians die within about three weeks of their invasion of england 4the martians themselves bear no physical resemblance to the novels martians who are described as bearsized roundish creatures with brown bodies merely heads with quivering beaklike vshaped mouths dripping saliva they have sixteen whiplike tentacles in two groupings of eight arranged on each side of their mouths and two large luminous disklike eyes due to budget constraints their film counterparts are short reddishbrown creatures with two long thin arms with three long thin fingers with suction cup tips the martians head if it can be called that is a broad face at the topfront of its broad shouldered upper torso the only apparent feature of which is a single large eye with three distinctly colored lenses red blue and green the martians lower extremities whatever they may be are never shown some speculative designs for the creature suggest the idea of three thin legs resembling their fingers while others show them as bipeds with short stubby legs with threetoed feet 4the films martian war machines do actually have more of a resemblance than they may seem at first glance the novels machines are 10story tall tripods and carry the heatray projector on an articulated arm connected to the front of the war machines main body the films machines are shaped like manta rays with a bulbous elongated green window at the front through which the martians observe their surroundings on top of the machine is the cobra headlike heatray attached to a long narrow gooseneck extension they can be mistaken for flying machines but forrester states that they are lifted by invisible legs in one scene when the first machine emerges you can see faint traces of three energy legs beneath and three sparking traces where the three energy shafts touch the burning ground therefore technically speaking the films war machines are indeed tripods though they are never given that designation whereas the novels war machines had no protection against british army and navy cannon fire the films war machines have a force field surrounding them this invisible shield is described by forrester as a protective blister 4the martian weaponry is also partially unchanged the heatray has the very same effect as that of the novel however the novels heatray mechanism is briefly described as just a rounded hump when first seen in silhouette rising above the landing craters rim it fires an invisible energy beam in a wide arc while still in the pit made by the first martian cylinder after it crashlands the films heatray projector when first seen is shaped like a cobras head and has a single red pulsing eye which likely acts like a targeting telescope for the martians inside their manta raylike war machine the novel describes another weapon the black smoke used to kill all life the war machines fire canisters containing a black smokepowder through a bazooka like tube accessory when dispersed this black powder is lethal to all life forms who breathe it this weapon is replaced in the film by a martian skeleton beam green pulsing bursts fired from the wingtips of the mantaray machines these bursts break apart the subatomic bonds that hold matter together on anything they touch these skeleton beams are used off screen to obliterate several french cities 4the plot of the film is very different from the novel which tells the story of a 19thcentury writer with additional narration in later chapters by his medical student younger brother who journeys through victorian london and its southwestern suburbs while the martians attack eventually being reunited with his wife the films protagonist is a california scientist who falls in love with a former college student after the martian invasion begins however certain points of the films plot are similar to the novel from the crashlanding of the martian meteoriteships to their eventual defeat by earths microorganisms forrester also experiences similar events like the books narrator an ordeal in a destroyed house observing an actual martian up close and eventually reuniting with his love interest at the end of the story the film is given more of a cold war theme with its use of the atomic bomb against the enemy and the massdestruction that such a global war would inflict on mankind 4music  editthe composer of the film score leith stevens also composed two other scores for pal productions destination moon and when worlds collide 3title sequence  editthe title sequence is dynamic and martial military stenciling flashes repeatedly in changing colors fast dissolves and swipes of various shapes all against an unchanging black background following a montage of scratched footage from both world wars showing the evolution of weaponry accompanied by a voiceover call to arms by voice actor paul frees in an solemn adamant voice the leith stevens’ martial score begins with a crash and flaring horns as “the war of the worlds” in brilliant technicolor red military stencil lettering appears in a smash cut rising in a second to fill the screen then the lettering changes into green followed by a circular iris swipe that reveals yellow stenciling “based on the novel by h g wells” another circular swipe reveals the cast names in green which then flash yellow rapidly then back to green a horizontal swipe from the left reveals in pastel blue stencil “screenplay by barré lyndon” followed by a swipe revealing rich dark blue lettering listing technical crew another vertical swipe from the top with pulsating flashing purple letters with more crew another swipe from the top showing in flashing orange and yellow stenciling the composer and associate producer another swipe with flashing red letters reveal the special effects artists swipe again this time with flashing red and white letters “produced by george pal” right into “directed by byron haskin” 8 9special effects  editthe war of the worlds won an academy award for best visual effects and was later selected for inclusion in the national film registry of the library of congress 3 an effort was made to avoid the stereotypical flying saucer look of ufos the martian war machines designed by al nozaki were instead made to be sinisterlooking machines shaped like manta rays floating above the ground three martian war machine props were made out of copper for the film the same blueprints were used a decade later to construct the alien spacecraft in the film robinson crusoe on mars also directed by byron haskin that film prop was later reported melted down as part of a scrap copper recycling drive 4 the model the late forrest ackerman had in his massive now dispersed los angeles science fiction collection was a replica made using the robinson crusoe on mars blueprints it was constructed by friends paul and larry brooks each martian machine was topped with an articulated metal neckarm culminating in the cobra like head housing a single electronic eye that operated both like a periscope and as a weapon the electronic eye also housed the martian heat ray which pulsed and fired red sparking beams all accompanied by thrumming and a highpitched clattering shriek when the ray was used the distinctive sound effect of the weapon was created by an orchestra performing a written score mainly through the use of violins and cellos for many years it was utilized as a standard raygun sound on childrens television shows and the sciencefiction anthology series the outer limits particularly in the episode  the children of spider county  3the machines also fired a pulsing green ray referred to as a skeleton beam from their wingtips generating a distinctive sound also disintegrating their targets notably people this second weapon is a replacement for the chemical weapon black smoke described in wells novel this weapons sound effect created by striking a high tension cable with a hammer was reused in star trek the original series accompanying the launch of photon torpedos the sound used when the martian ships begin to move was also recycled by the original series as the sound of an overloading hand phaser another prominent sound effect was a chattering synthesized echo perhaps representing some kind of martian sonar it can be described as sounding like hissing electronic rattlesnakes 3when the large marine force opens fire on the martians with everything in its heavy arsenal each martian machine is protected by an impenetrable force field that resembles when briefly visible between explosions the clear jar placed over a mantle clock or a bell jar cylindrical and with a hemispherical top this effect was accomplished by the use of simple matte paintings on clear glass which were then photographed and combined with other effects then optically printed together during postproduction 4the disintegration effect took 144 separate matte paintings to create the sound effects of the war machines heat rays firing were created by mixing the sound of three electric guitars being recorded backwards the martians scream in the farmhouse ruins was created by mixing the sound of a microphone scraping along dry ice being combined with a womans recorded scream and then reverseplayed for the sound effect mix 3there were many problems trying to create the walking tripods of wells novel it was eventually decided to make the martian machines appear to float in the air on three invisible legs to show their existence subtle special effects downward lights were to be added directly under the moving war machines however in the final film these only appear when one of the first machines can be seen rising from the martians landing site it proved too difficult to mark out the invisible legs when smoke and other effects had to be seen beneath the machines and the effect used to create them also created a major fire hazard in all of the subsequent scenes however the three invisible leg beams create small sparking fires where they touch the ground 3reception  editrelease  editthe war of the worlds had its official hollywood premiere on february 20 1953 although it did not go into general theatrical release until the autumn of that year 4 the film was both a critical and box office success it accrued 2000000 in distributors domestic u s and canada rentals making it the years biggest science fiction film hit 10 note 1critical reaction  editthe new york times review of the war of the worlds noted  the film is an imaginatively conceived professionally turned adventure which makes excellent use of technicolor special effects by a crew of experts and impressively drawn backgrounds  director byron haskin working from a tight script by barré lyndon has made this excursion suspenseful fast and on occasion properly chilling 11 brog in variety felt  it is a socko sciencefiction feature as fearsome as a film as was the orson welles 1938 radio interpretationwhat starring honors there are go strictly to the special effects which create an atmosphere of soulchilling apprehension so effectively that audiences will actually take alarm at the danger posed in the picture it cant be recommended for the weakhearted but to the many who delight in an occasional good scare its socko entertainment of hackleraising quality 12 13the war of the worlds won an academy award for special effects it was the sole nominee that year while everett douglas and loren l ryder were nominated for film editing and sound recording respectively 14the war of the worlds still receives high acclaim from critics at the review aggregator website rotten tomatoes the film has an 85 rating based on 27 critics the consensus states though its dated in spots the war of the worlds retains an unnerving power updating h g wells classic scifi tale to the cold war era and featuring some of the best special effects of any 1950s film 15legacy  editthe war of the worlds was deemed culturally historically or aesthetically significant in 2011 by the united states library of congress and was selected for preservation in the national film registry 16 the registry noted the films release during the early years of the cold war and how it used the apocalyptic paranoia of the atomic age 17 the registry also cited the films special effects which at its release were called soulchilling hackleraising and not for the faint of heart 17american film institute afis 100 years100

part by infecting the mothership with a computer virus there are also several other allusions to pals 1953 war of the worlds the failed attempt of a dropped atomic bomb is replaced with a nuclear armed cruise missile launched by a b2 spirit bomber a direct descendant of the northrop yb49 bomber used in the 1953 film and captain hiller being based in el toro california which dr forrester mentions as being the home of the marines which make the first assault on the invading martians in pals film 19the asylum s 2005 directtodvd h g wells war of the worlds has mild references to the pal version inside the martians mouth they have three tongues that closely resemble the three martian fingers seen in the pal film the asylum film also includes scenes of power outages after the aliens arrival via meteoriteships as in the pal film refugees are seen hiding in the mountains instead of hiding underground as in the wells novel and the protagonist actively tries to fight the aliens by biological means 20steven spielberg s 2005 war of the worlds although an adaptation of the original wells novel does feature several references to the original film gene barry and ann robinson have cameo appearances near the end and the invading aliens have threefingered hands but are depicted as reptilelike threelegged walking tripods there is also a long snakelike alien camera probe deployed by the invaders in much the same manner as in the 1953 film 21mystery science theater 3000 named one of its lead characters the mad scientist dr clayton forrester as a homage to the 1953 film 22in
