944 oil recommendation hello i have an 87 944 that i do not have the owners manual for can anyone tell me what the manual says for recommended oil weight type and quantity someone recommended that i use 63 quarts of 20w50 castrol or 15w50 mobil 1 and i chose to try 20w50 castrol synthetic blend because its cheaper then mobil 1 the pressure gauge usually never drops below 4 bar to maybe just below that on a hot day from what ive heard it should read around 25  3 bar when completely warm so this weight seems a little heavy to me also can anyone recommend an oil and weight that they have found works best or should i just try a lighter castrol synthetic blend thanks tim
