lots of different type of leds on the market that would be suitable for a closet whether its a replacement lamp or strip lighting the strips as mentioned above are very versatile you may consider mounting the strip to a small metaaluminum channel it is true that led does not emit heat like incandescentbut they do produce heat which needs to be absorbed somewhere heat build up from lack of a heat sink can actually degrade the life of the leds typically most led striptape is not going to come with these channels and there is not enough of a heat conductor with the material inside the tape the channels are very inexpensive and you can stick the tape right to the channel i have seen this happen with many brands of led tape lighting from highend to very cheap with out a proper heat sink the tape gets very yellow over time and the led diodes dots burn out in random places along the striptypically where the heat is building up the most nothing you can do when this happens besides replace the strips like save january 29 2014 at 221pmthank you for reporting this comment undolefty47hi  over the next few years they are fazing out the incandescent bulbs so l e d is the future like

lighting is also probably not meeting nec requirements the led lighting needs to be a specifically listed and labeled assembly for the exact installation method and placement used in a closet using stock rolls of led tape and putting it wherever you please is not allowed nec 410161 like save january 29 2014 at 410pm thanked by toronto647thank you for reporting this comment undoedithsmom thanks

undo fred syes if you want to it is fairly common to mix like you are thinking for different rooms 3000k is supposed to still be on the warm side or at least not cool the way that led colors are made can vary so it is best to test the specific brand bulbs in the room preferably after paint and flooring before making a final decision1 like save may 5 2014 at 1235pmthank you for reporting this
