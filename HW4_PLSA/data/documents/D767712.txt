subclass of lactones 1 it is a natural substance found in many plants and a colorless crystalline substance in its standard state the name comes from a french term for the tonka bean coumarou one of the sources from which coumarin was first isolated as a natural product in 1820 it has a sweet odor readily recognised as the scent of newlymown hay and has been used in perfumes since 1882 sweet woodruff meadowsweet sweet grass and sweetclover in particular are named for their sweet  ie pleasant smell which in turn is related to their high coumarin content when it occurs in high concentrations in forage plants coumarin is a somewhat bittertasting appetite suppressant and is presumed to be produced by plants as a defense chemical to discourage predation coumarin is used in certain perfumes and fabric conditioners coumarin has been used as an aroma enhancer in pipe tobaccos and certain alcoholic drinks although in general it is banned as a flavorant food additive due to concerns regarding its hepatotoxicity in animal models coumarin was first synthesized in 1868 it is used in the pharmaceutical industry as a precursor reagent in the synthesis of a number of synthetic anticoagulant pharmaceuticals similar to dicoumarol the notable ones being warfarin  brand name coumadin and some even more potent rodenticides that work by the same anticoagulant mechanism 4hydroxycoumarins are a type of vitamin k antagonist pharmaceutical modified coumarins were all developed from the study of sweet clover disease see warfarin for this history however unmodified coumarin itself as it occurs in plants has no effect on the vitamin k coagulation system or on the action of warfarintype drugs coumarin has clinical medical value by itself as an edema modifier coumarin and other benzopyrones such as 56benzopyrone 12benzopyrone diosmin and others are known to stimulate macrophages to degrade extracellular albumin allowing faster resorption of edematous fluids 2 3 other biological activities that may lead to other medical uses have been suggested with varying degrees of evidence coumarin is also used as a gain medium in some dye lasers 4 5 6 and as a sensitizer in older photovoltaic technologies 7contents  hide 1 history2 etymology3 synthesis4 natural occurrences5 metabolism51 metabolism in humans6 biological function7 derivatives8 medical use9

isolated from tonka beans and sweet clover in 1820 by a vogel of munich who initially mistook it for benzoic acid 8 9 also in 1820 nicholas jean baptiste gaston guibourt 1790–1867 of france independently isolated coumarin but he realized that it was not benzoic acid 10 in a subsequent essay he presented to the pharmacy section of the académie royale de médecine guibourt named the new substance coumarine 11 12 in 1835 the french pharmacist a guillemette proved that vogel and guibourt had isolated the same substance 13 coumarin was first synthesized in 1868 by the english chemist william henry perkin 14etymology  editcoumarin is derived from coumarou the french word for the tonka bean the word tonka for the tonka bean is taken from the galibi carib tongue spoken by natives of french guiana one source for the plant it also appears in old tupi another language of the same region as the name of the tree the old genus name coumarouna was formed from another tupi name for tree kumarú synthesis  editcoumarin can be prepared by a number of name reactions with the perkin reaction between salicylaldehyde and acetic anhydride being a popular example the pechmann condensation provides another route to coumarin and its derivatives as does the kostanecki acylation which can also be used to produce chromones natural occurrences  editcoumarin is found naturally in many plants notably in high concentration in the tonka bean  dipteryx odorata  vanilla grass  anthoxanthum odoratum  sweet woodruff  galium odoratum  mullein  verbascum spp  sweet grass  hierochloe odorata  cassia cinnamon  cinnamomum cassia not to be confused with true cinnamon ceylon cinnamon cinnamomum zeylanicum which contains little coumarin sweetclover  melilotus sp  deertongue  dichanthelium clandestinum  and the leaves of many cherry blossom tree varieties of the prunus genus coumarin is also found in extracts of justicia pectoralis 15 16related compounds are found in some but not all specimens of licorice 17metabolism  editthe biosynthesis of coumarin in plants is via hydroxylation glycolysis and cyclization of cinnamic acid metabolism in humans  editthe enzyme encoded by the gene ugt1a8 has glucuronidase activity with many substrates including coumarins 18biological function  editcoumarin has appetitesuppressing properties which may discourage animals from eating plants which contain it though the compound has a pleasant sweet odor it has a bitter taste and animals tend to avoid it 19derivatives  editcoumarin and its derivatives are all considered phenylpropanoids some naturally occurring coumarin derivatives include umbelliferone 7hydroxycoumarin aesculetin 67dihydroxycoumarin herniarin 7methoxycoumarin psoralen and imperatorin4phenylcoumarin is the backbone of the neoflavones a type of neoflavonoids medical use  editcoumarins have shown some evidence of biological activity and have limited approval for few medical uses as pharmaceuticals such as in the treatment of lymphedema 20 and their ability to increase plasma antithrombin levels 21 both coumarin and indandione derivatives produce a uricosuric effect presumably by interfering with the renal tubular reabsorption of urate 22laser applications  editcoumarin dyes are extensively used as gain media in bluegreen tunable organic dye lasers 4 5 6 among the various coumarin laser dyes are coumarins 480 490 504 521 504t and 521t 6 coumarin tetramethyl laser dyes offer wide tunability and high laser gain 23 24 and they are also used as active medium in coherent oled emitters 25toxicity and use in foods beverages cosmetics and tobacco  editcoumarin is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys with a median lethal dose ld 50 of 275 mgkg a low toxicity compared to related compounds though it is only somewhat dangerous to humans coumarin is hepatotoxic in rats but less so in mice rodents metabolize it mostly to 34coumarin epoxide a toxic unstable compound that on further differential metabolism may cause liver cancer in rats and lung tumors in mice 26 27 humans metabolize it mainly to 7hydroxycoumarin a compound of lower toxicity the german federal institute for risk assessment has established a tolerable daily intake tdi of 01 mg coumarin per kg body weight but also advises that higher intake for a short time is not dangerous 28 the occupational safety and health administration osha of the united states does not classify coumarin as a carcinogen for humans 29european health agencies have warned against consuming high amounts of cassia bark one of the four main species of cinnamon because of its coumarin content 30 31 according to the german federal institute for risk assessment bfr 1 kg of cassia cinnamon powder contains about 21 to 44 g of coumarin 32 powdered cassia cinnamon weighs 056 gcm 3 33 so a kilogram of cassia cinnamon powder equals 36229 teaspoons one teaspoon of cassia cinnamon powder therefore contains 58 to 121 mg of coumarin which may be above the tolerable daily intake value for smaller individuals 32 however the bfr only cautions against high daily intake of foods containing coumarin its report 32 specifically states that ceylon cinnamon  cinnamomum verum contains hardly any coumarin the european regulation ec no 13342008 describes the following maximum limits for coumarin 50 mgkg in traditional andor seasonal bakery ware containing a reference to cinnamon in the labeling 20 mgkg in breakfast cereals including muesli 15 mgkg in fine bakery ware with the exception of traditional andor seasonal bakery ware containing a reference to cinnamon in the labeling and 5 mgkg in desserts an investigation from the danish veterinary and food administration in 2013 shows that bakery goods characterized as fine bakery ware exceeds the european limit 15 mgkg in almost 50 of the cases 34 the paper also mentions tea as an additional important contributor to the overall coumarin intake especially for children with a sweet habit coumarin is found naturally in many edible plants such as strawberries black currants apricots and cherries 35coumarin is often found in artificial vanilla substitutes despite having been banned as a food additive in numerous countries since the mid20th century coumarin was banned as a food additive in the united states in 1954 largely because of the hepatotoxicity results in rodents 36 coumarin is currently listed by the food and drug administration fda of the united states among substances generally prohibited from direct addition or use as human food according to 21 cfr 189130 37 38 but some natural additives containing coumarin such as the flavorant sweet woodruff are allowed in alcoholic beverages only under 21 cfr 172510 39 in europe popular examples of such beverages are maiwein white wine with woodruff and żubrówka vodka flavoured with bison grass coumarin is subject to restrictions on its use in perfumery 40 as some people may become sensitized to it however the evidence that coumarin can cause an allergic reaction in humans is disputed 41minor neurological dysfunction was found in children exposed to coumarin during pregnancy a group of 306 children were tested at ages 7–15 years to determine subtle neurological effects from coumarin exposure results showed a dose response relationship between coumarin exposure and minor neurological dysfunction overall a 19 90 increase in minor neurological dysfunction was observed for children exposed to coumarin in conclusion researchers stated the results suggest that coumarins have an influence on the development of the brain which can lead to mild neurologic dysfunctions in children of school age 42coumarin is still used as a legal flavorant in the tobacco industry particularly for sweet pipe tobacco its presence in cigarette tobacco led former brown  williamson executive 43 dr jeffrey wigand to contact cbs s news show 60 minutes in 1995 charging that a “form of rat poison ” was in the tobacco he held that from a chemist’s point of view coumarin is an “immediate precursor” to the rodenticide coumadin dr wigand later stated that coumarin itself is dangerous pointing out that the fda had banned its addition to human food in 1954 44 under his later testimony he would repeatedly classify coumarin as a lungspecific carcinogen 45 in germany coumarin is banned as an additive in tobacco alcoholic beverages sold in the european union are limited to a maximum of 10 mgl coumarin by law 46 cinnamon flavor is generally cassia bark steamdistilled to concentrate the cinnamaldehyde for example to about 93 clear cinnamonflavored alcoholic beverages generally test negative for coumarin but if whole cassia bark is used to make mulled wine then coumarin shows up in significant levels related compounds and derivatives  editmain article 4hydroxycoumarins compounds derived from coumarin are also called coumarins or coumarinoids this family includesbrodifacoum 47 48bromadiolone 49coumafuryl 50difenacoum 51aurapteneensaculinphenprocoumon marcoumarpsbsb487psbsb1202scopoletin can be isolated from the bark of shorea pinanga 52warfarin coumadincoumarin is transformed into the natural anticoagulant dicoumarol by a number of species of fungi 53 this occurs as the result of the production of 4hydroxycoumarin then further in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde into the actual anticoagulant dicoumarol a fermentation product and mycotoxin dicoumarol was responsible for the bleeding disease known historically as  sweet clover disease in cattle eating moldy sweet clover silage 53 54 in basic research preliminary evidence exists for coumarin having various biological activities including antiinflammatory antitumor antibacterial and antifungal properties among others 53use as pesticides  editmany of the abovestated compounds to be specific the 4hydroxycoumarins sometimes loosely called coumarins are used as anticoagulant drugs andor as rodenticides which work by the anticoagulant mechanism they block the regeneration and recycling of vitamin k these chemicals are sometimes also incorrectly referred to as coumadins rather than 4hydroxycoumarins coumadin is a brand name for the drug warfarin some of the 4hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant class of chemicals are designed to have very high potency and long residence times in the body and these are used specifically as poison rodenticides death occurs after a period of several days to two weeks usually from internal hemorrhaging vitamin k is a true antidote for poisoning by these antirodenticide 4hydroxycoumarins such as bromadiolone treatment usually comprises a large dose of vitamin k given intravenously immediately followed by doses in pill form for a period of at least two weeks though usually three to four afterwards treatment may even continue for several months if caught early the prognosis is good even when large amounts are ingested in the short term transfusion with fresh frozen plasma to provide clotting factors provides time for vitamin k to reverse enzyme poisoning in the liver and allow new clotting factors to be synthesized there  citation neededreferences
