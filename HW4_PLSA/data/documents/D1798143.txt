territory let’s take a closeup look at the top macro lenses available now keep in mind that all the lenses and recommended alternatives for discontinued lenses in this article are available at adorama’s macro lens department once exclusively the domain of dslrs the macro has started to make inroads into the rapidly growing category of mirrorless interchangeable lens compacts milcs you can see the small but growing selection of milc macro lenses at the end of this article note if you have a zoom lens that says it’s a “macro” don’t believe it sure it’ll get you close likely to within 13 magnification that’s 13 lifesize on the film or sensor but technically true macro is considered 11 magnification—lifesized–or higher closeup filters are a less expensive way to get into macro photography but you will probably lose a little image quality especially if you use budget closeup filters if you choose to go this route stick to name brands and look for specially coated surfaces reversal rings are another way to go these rings mount directly on your camera you screw the lens front into the ring so it is facing the reverse direction turning the optics around can yield dramatic superclose results read carl heilman ii’s article on shooting spectacular closeups of snowflakes by using reversal rings and if you want to do something totally off the wall that will separate your
