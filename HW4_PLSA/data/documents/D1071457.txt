environmental education climate is influenced by factors like atmosphere ocean currents landforms and plate tectonics this lesson explains how these effects affect our weather patterns which determine climate climate introduction droughts superstorms melting glaciers oh my we hear about extreme weather events often and are told that they are the result of a changing climate global warming is changing our climate by heating the earths temperature but isnt that weather what is the difference between weather and climate just like weather climate is affected by many factors that do not change rapidly like ocean currents gases in the atmosphere and moving continents in this lesson well explore how these factors can have a big effect on what we see and the kinds of conditions we can expect weather and climate weather and climate are terms that are related but do not mean the same thing weather is the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place for instance this would be if it currently is sunny today and what the temperature is or if we are expecting clouds and rain tomorrow weather is what is forecasted from day to day climate is the longterm average of the weather of an area this would refer more to the type of weather you could expect at different times of the year normally the northern u s can expect snow and belowfreezing temperatures in winter and warm summers with some humidity these expected weather patterns together with other factors make up our climate which generally remains unchanged over the span of a human lifetime atmospheric effects there are many factors that can influence the climate of a region one of the main things that determines the climate of an area is the circulation of air in the atmosphere the atmosphere is the blanket of air that surrounds the earth the atmosphere circulates air in patterns or in a band caused by the heating of the earth by the sun and the earths rotation air near the tropical regions rises as it gets heated while cooler air near the poles sinks warmer air has more energy and is less dense than cooler air which causes this rising and sinking action however the earths rotation also has an effect on this movement of air by breaking the rising and sinking action of air into six distinct sections these bands alternate the direction of wind flow much like the bands that are seen on jupiter two different wind patterns the trade winds and the prevailing westerlies for instance near the equator the prevailing winds move from east to west and are known as the trade winds shown in yellow and brown on the map next the blue arrows show the bands of air that travel west to east  the dominant wind pattern for the united states  and are known as the prevailing westerlies this difference can be seen any time a hurricane gets close to us and we begin tracking it as the storm forms in the atlantic it moves from east to west caught up in the trade winds as it moves north near north america its direction will begin to shift back to the east as it moves into a band of air moving in the opposite direction another effect on climate can come from the composition of the atmosphere itself the greenhouse effect is when gases naturally trap heat in the atmosphere moderating the earths temperature these gases include carbon dioxide methane and water vapor if the percentage of these gases changes over time due to natural or manmade effects then the amount of heat held in can change also this is the concern with global warming  that we are adding too much carbon dioxide to the atmosphere warming the planet heat distribution another factor that influences climate is how the earth distributes heat large bodies of water along with ocean currents greatly influence a regions climate by holding and redistributing heat through the water adding moisture to the air and influencing the strength and direction of the wind ocean currents move heat around from areas that are warmer to areas that are cooler adding energy and moisture to new regions an example of ocean temperatures effect on our weather and climate is the el niño effect that occurs in the pacific in el niño a band of water near the equator becomes warmer than normal and transfers extra heat disrupting normal weather patterns in the united states this can cause warmer drier winters with less snow in the northern states and more rain and cooler temperatures in the southern states to unlock this lesson you must be a studycom member create your account register for a free trial are you a student or a
