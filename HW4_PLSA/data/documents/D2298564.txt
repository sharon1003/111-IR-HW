baking temperatures wastelands of salt—its hard to imagine a more brutal landscape than africas danakil desert but for the afar people this is a home to die for i have news edris hassan announced gravely seating himself on a boulder above ethiopiaís saba river in the northern danakil desert he propped his kalashnikov assault rifle beside him edris was tall for an afar one of the pastoralist peoples who roam this harsh land and built like what he was a warrior and militiaman for our small party of travelers he was also guard and guide his reputation and weapon smoothing our way through the afar considered among the fiercest people in the world in the town of hamed ela while waiting to join the salttrading caravan we were now traveling with id learned from edris that news or dagu as the afar call it is a weighty subject something to be pondered and assessed it is more than a bush telegraph or village gossip more than the latest headlines instead in a ceremony of handshakes and hand kisses the afar pass along recitations of all they have seen and heard a poetic litany that can bealmost homeric in its detail and precision it is through dagu that they learn of any newcomers to their desert realm of the conditions of water holes and grazing lands of missing camels and caravans they learn of weddings and funerals of new alliances and betrayals of the latest battles fought and the conditions of the trail ahead they learn about what has changed in a changeable land and in the world at large and from all this they pick a course of action those who pay the closest attention to the news they say may go on to survive inshallah—god willing edris turned now to share the latest dagu with us—photographer carsten peter and me—speaking in amharic ethiopias lingua franca through our interpreter zelalem abera i met a friend here edris said tilting his head toward a small cluster of thatched huts that make up the afar village of asso bollo he has news of trouble ahead the ugugumo are in the canyon theyre stopping all the caravans asking for money causing trouble its not safe for us to continue if you go ahead youre no longer my responsibility the ugugumo wed heard rumors about these rebels the afar revolutionary democratic unity front from the first day we set foot in the desert they were wed been told wild and unpredictable and as hard and unforgiving as the sands of the desert but they were also heroes men of courage since they were fighting to regain afar territory that was lost in the early 1990s when eritrea defeated ethiopia and became a separate nation edris sat back and uncorked his canteen then upended it and symbolically emptied his water into the sand he wasnt about to tangle with the ugugumo for him this was the end of the trail carsten zelalem and i looked at one another stunned wed waited over a week in hamed ela to join these afar salt caravans which had ceased their longdistance journeys during the muslim holy month of ramadan and now that we were at last with them we wanted to keep going wed been warned that the threeday trip would be hot and exhausting a thirsty plod from the salt flats beyond hamed ela through rocky desert and canyons to the larger town of berahile where the caravans unloaded their salt but wed never expected it to come to such a sudden end what were we to do it was nearly three oclock in the morning below us in the silky glow of starlight the caravans wed been with continued to make their way up the riverbank and disappeared around a bend into a sandstone canyon—pursuing the very route that edris had declared too dangerous for us to follow yet danger and hardship were what wed come to the danakil desert for—or at least wanted to observe by traveling with the salt traders we hoped to gain insights into the afar way of life already following our week in hamed ela a dustandflystricken hamlet id formed some opinions one was that people can and will live anywhere—even in the danakil a place of dry sands and even drier gravel beds rocky lava flows active volcanoes burning salt flats temperatures that often top 120°f winds that choke you with dust and suffocating days of no wind at all even worse this place where rain falls sparingly at the best of times was now in the grip of a bad drought and the halfmummified carcasses of camels and goats lay strewn across the sands and the ugugumo wanted to liberate this land what was there to be freed i wondered why would anyone fight over this hellacious place and how had it come to have such a hold on these people the salt merchants id asked the day before looked baffled by my question its the salt they said hoisting blocks the size of encyclopedias onto their camels its our corn its our gold of course we would fight anyone who tried to take it hed met the merchants at the salt mines that lie beyond hamed ela and border lake asele in the heart of the northern danakil more than 300 feet below sea level the salt lake and plains are one of the lowest points in africa the absolute lowest at 512 feet lies farther southeast in the danakil at lake assal in djibouti here teams of muslim afar and christian tigrayans from the ethiopian highlands gather daily ten months out of the year to mine the salt and ferry it by camel mule and donkey to markets in ethiopias mountains and beyond into sudan in the past the salt blocks called amolé were used throughout ethiopia as money although hard cash has replaced the salt the trade itself remains the main livelihood of the northern afar and they guard their treasure—as well as every grain of sand in their desert—like the argonauts of old the afar make sure that no one robs them of their salt by studiously overseeing the mines and caravans every merchant must stop at the salttax collectors hut in the dusty enclave of hamed ela on the edge of the salt flats and pay a fee for each camel mule and donkey in his caravan at the mines every job—from levering the salt from the earth to running the outdoor tea kitchens—is assigned and managed by an afar theirs is a strict monopoly and it has made them proud and dictatorial they do not hesitate for a minute to let you know that once you set foot in their salt kingdom you are subject to their commands we found that out in berahile which sits about midway up the escarpment that rises above the desert the government offices of the northern afar region—a semiautonomous part of ethiopia—are located in berahile the main market town for the afar caravans which is presided over by the turbaned and dignified ali hassan bore before venturing to the mines carsten zelalem and i paid ali a visit joining him and his retainers on the veranda of one of the squat government buildings in his 50s ali had the bearing of a sultan he wore a beige polo shirt and green plaid sarong with a wide leather belt a short dagger was discreetly tucked into it over his shoulder he displayed a notsodiscreet but holstered colt 45caliber pistol his front teeth were chipped to points crocodilestyle a cosmetic embellishment that afar men and women consider beautiful ali sat soldierstraight in his chair while his assistants crowded close by some squatting on their heels others leaning against a wall like ali they were all heavily armed and they listened carefully to our request to visit the salt mines their eyes were narrowed and suspicious as they squinted against the sun 1 of 3 next subscribe to national geographic magazine top supported by canon click here to explore information and photography of our worlds endangered
