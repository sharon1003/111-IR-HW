desktop app tiles on the start screen the following provides information on choices to consider when tailoring desktop app tiles for windows 8 including how to design desktop app tiles for the new start screen and how to choose what entry points to show in the start screen design your tile for the start screen you can customize two aspects of your desktop app tiles the app name and icon the background color is derived from the users chosen background color and isnt programmatically customizable do avoid truncation of your application name desktop tiles pinned to the start screen can accommodate up to two lines of text each line or about around ten characters though this depends on the ui language so try to keep the application name short enough to avoid truncation do provide icons for the four supported start screen scale values to ensure that your icons look crisp on all form factors scale tile size in pixels icon size used in pixels80 120 x 120 48 x 48100 150 x 150 64 x 64140 210 x 210 96 x 96180 270 x 270 128 x 128do embrace the microsoft design principles the new look and feel for icons is flat so if you want to mimic windows store app icons for your desktop app consider taking out drop shadows and so on dont dont avoid the use of color while windows store app icons are sometimes monochromatic we recommend using color icons for desktop apps this helps differentiate desktop applications on the taskbar and from other desktop app tiles in the start screen because the background color of desktop tiles cant be customized do consider using more saturated colors decide the right entry points to include in the start screen do add one shortcut per app in the start screen when the app is installed this ensures that people can launch your app directly from the start screen or through search if you do not include a shortcut in the start screen your app becomes difficult to launch in particular do not add a shortcut only on the desktop users see the start screen when they first login and so placing a shortcut only on the desktop isnt as effective as including it in the start screen dont dont provide multiple shortcuts to the same app for example dont have two shortcuts that launch an app in two different modes such as one for windows internet explorer and one for internet explorer with no addons do minimize the number of tiles that are added as part of installation consider exposing other entry points to the extraneous apps for example instead of including a separate settings app with a console app access the settings through a feature in the console app dont dont put shortcuts to the following items on the start screen uninstallers users can access uninstallers through the programs item in the control panel help files include help topics directly in your app app settings and options include ui to configure settings for an app within the app or create a control panel item web sites provide any appropriate links to information like help and technical support sites directly in your app wizards wizards and other onetime configuration tasks should be launched from within the app dont dont create shortcuts to features or functionality that can be launched from within the app itself for example language settings can be configured from any microsoft office app so its unnecessary also to have a separate language settings entry point on the start screen dont dont create shortcuts to items that are not executable files shortcuts that dont map to executables such as shortcuts that launch web sites or help files are filtered out of the start screen do if you install a suite of apps rather than a single app add one shortcut for each app in the suite as mentioned above avoid creating shortcuts to secondary functionality like help information utilities and settings that functionality should be included in the relevant app s of the suite do create a singlelevel product folder for suites that contain three or more tiles in the apps view of the start screen accessible from the search charm applications are grouped by their top level folder choose a descriptive yet concise folder name three words or fewer are recommended be aware that while the apps view groups tiles and shows the folder name this name isnt visible when a tile is pinned to the start screen so make your tile names sufficiently descriptive dont dont create a product folder if your suite contains only a single shortcut place your shortcut in the toplevel start folder do when installing a suite of more than three apps consider whether any of those apps are for secondary more irregular use and should not be pinned to the start screen if so perhaps those tiles can be removed entirely according to the guidance above and launched from within a primary app if you cant remove the tiles consider unpinning them from the start screen that way the shortcuts still appear in the all apps view but dont clutter the users start screen to create add an app shortcut without pinning it to the start screen set the following property on the shortcut system app user model start pin option  1 the symbolic name for 1 is appusermodelstartpinoptionnopinoninstall this prevents the shortcut from being shown on the start screen but it can still be seen in the all apps view and search results only the user can unpin existing shortcuts so you must set this property during installation or immediately after placing the app on disk dont dont create a tile for a host or runtime for applications like silverlight or java provide an entry point to uninstall the framework in addremove programs and provide any settings entry point in control panel
