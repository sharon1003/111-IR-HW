the archive loading in july 2013 the activist investor nelson peltz called pepsi co’s chair and ceo indra nooyi to tell her that his trian fund management had accumulated a more than 13 billion stake in her company he demanded that pepsi co acquire mondelēz international the former kraft snacks business in which peltz owned a 1 billion stake and then split pepsi co into two entities one focused on beverages and the other on food peltz had staged a similar intervention at kraft where he pushed ceo irene rosenfeld to acquire cadbury schweppes and then split the combined company into a global snacks business mondelēz and a u s grocery one kraft mondelēz had struggled however to compete with global giants such as nestlé and unilever hence peltz’s pepsi co plan it was an audacious even shocking proposal but it’s the kind of thing that happens often these days since the start of the 21st century a new breed of shareholder—the activist hedge fund—has frequently played a decisive role in interactions between corporations and markets these activists build on past efforts their interest in governance changes such as eliminating staggered boards and poison pills follows similar efforts by publicemployee and union pension funds since the 1990s their focus on getting companies to take on more debt and pay out more to shareholders recalls the corporate raiders of the 1980s in fact a few of the most prominent activists including peltz and carl icahn are former corporate raiders the new activists have dramatically upped the pressure on corporate executives and boards nearly every business day they target another company more than 200 activist campaigns were launched in 2013 according to the law firm wachtell lipton rosen  katz and assets under management at activist funds were up more than 50 although the value of those funds was estimated at 100 billion—a mere fraction of 1 of the total stock market value of american corporations—the activists’ leverage and impact far exceed the dollars they invest their game is simple they buy stocks they view as undervalued and pressure management to do things they believe will raise the value such as giving more cash back to shareholders or shedding divisions that they think are driving down the stock price with increasing frequency they get deeply involved in governance—demanding board seats replacing ceos and advocating specific business strategies multiple studies have shown that activism succeeds in raising share prices at least temporarily a major recent study by lucian bebchuk alon brav and wei jiang of activist investments from 1994 through 2007 also found fiveyear improvements in the operating performance of targeted companies we remain unconvinced however that hedge fund activism is a positive trend for u s corporations and the economy in fact we find that it reinforces shorttermism and excessive attention to financial metrics but because activists—and the institutional investors who often follow their lead—are generating positive returns there is likely to be more rather than less of it in the future in the interest of their corporations ceos and boards should be preparing for activist interventions rather than complaining about them bill george on how to prepare for activist interventions read more indra nooyi and pepsi co’s board were prepared for nelson peltz’s onslaught indra nooyi and pepsi co’s board were prepared for nelson peltz’s onslaught as we describe below they had in place a strategic plan that seemed far better attuned to changing market realities than peltz’s simplistic splitsnacksfromdrinks proposal have a clear strategic focus and stick to it —that is one of six ways we’ve identified in which top management and boards can fend off activist challenges or sometimes even use them to improve their organizations have a clear strategic focus and stick to it when she became pepsi co’s ceo in 2006 nooyi recognized that longterm trends such as the global rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes would shift consumer demand toward more healthful foods and beverages and eventually slow the growth of pepsi co’s core business in soft drinks and snacks in response she devised performance with purpose a strategy targeting three growth areas 1 “good for you” products including quaker oats and gatorade 2 product innovations and 3 emerging markets part of the idea was to fund the substantial investments—including acquisitions—required to build these categories with the cash flow from pepsi co’s core business pepsi co did precisely that acquiring a number of food and beverage companies in emerging economies such as brazil india russia and ukraine a major transformation like that can put pressure on management and the board because results typically take five to 10 years to be realized as nooyi’s predecessor steve reinemund has put it “major change is never applauded until your numbers prove it” in 2010 pepsi co hit some bumps when coke gained share on its soft drinks and diet coke overtook pepsicola as the secondbestselling soft drink in the world pepsi co shares declined by 4 while cocacola’s rose by 40 causing shareholders to criticize nooyi for failing to invest sufficiently in soft drinks with her board’s support nooyi addressed those issues by making some key management changes but she stayed with her strategic shift over the past two years pepsi co has achieved solid growth in all categories and significantly outperformed cocacola on the stock market in 2013 pepsi co’s revenue and earnings per share rose by 1 and 10 respectively while cocacola’s revenue and eps declined by 2 and 3 with a focused strategy that was paying dividends nooyi and pepsi co’s board could comfortably reject proposals from peltz “pepsi co as a portfolio is working so well right now” cfo hugh johnston said in the summer of 2013 “the complexity of taking on an 80 billion acquisition mondelēz…will distract the business from…creating a lot of value for shareholders” apparently most of the company’s shareholders agreed peltz hasn’t given up but when this article went to press he still hadn’t made visible headway analyze your business as an activist would ceos need to ensure that their boards understand the tactics of activist investors and have a game plan for responding that means analyzing both how the activists might try to increase shortterm shareholder value—through spinoffs and divestitures or financial engineering such as stock buybacks and increased debt—and the company’s possible vulnerabilities in strategy and capital structure specific examples from other companies can help the changes activists want generally involve increasing risk in the pursuit of higher returns but that’s not always a bad thing if a company can do that without jeopardizing corporate strategy it should move before an activist forces it to the swiss health care company novartis is in the midst of just such an analysis initiated by its new chairman joerg reinhardt ceo joseph jimenez said in the company’s 2013 thirdquarter earnings call that the review is aimed at creating businesses with the scale to compete globally three of novartis’s businesses—pharmaceuticals eye care and generics—generate revenue of at least 10 billion a year and are ranked first or second in their respective markets the company’s three smaller businesses—vaccines and diagnostics overthecounter medicines and animal health—don’t pass that test consequently to reduce the likelihood of an activist intervention novartis may consider augmenting them through acquisition or selling some of them all multibusiness companies should take this approach to determine whether the corporate strategy adds value to individual business units the analysis must be rigorous to ensure that management is sufficiently objective about synergies and value added in 2004 target corporation long one of the nation’s bestrun retailers undertook a similar analysis of its three retail arms—daytonhudson mervyn’s and target concluding that synergies were limited and that the real growth potential lay with target it divested the other two arms have your external advisers lined up in advance and familiar with your company in 2007 and 2008 bill ackman’s pershing square hedge fund loaded up on shares of target as the company struggled with declining samestore sales during the recession initially ackman focused on persuading the target board to spin off its credit card operations the board resisted because of the significant benefits of using its own card to incentivize and reward customers eventually it agreed to sell 47 of the business to jpmorgan chase when ackman insisted that target divest the remaining 53 the board refused next ackman proposed that target separate its real estate operations which own most of its 680 stores and put them into a real estate investment trust reit target’s board and management concluded that doing so would mean losing control over its store properties facing escalating operating costs to lease the stores back from the reit and taking on too much leverage with the reit so they again rejected ackman’s demands further reading building better boards boards feature david a nadler a set of tools to define and achieve your objectives save share ackman then launched a proxy fight to replace longstanding board members with himself and four other directors of his choice he appeared almost daily on cnbc to take his case directly to investors target’s board and management fought back meeting directly with major shareholders ultimately target’s directors won more than 73 of the votes cast at the 2008 annual meeting and ackman sold the bulk of his target shares shortly thereafter to be prepared for such challenges both management and the board must have external advisers whose guidance they can rely on target had been working with the same financial adviser goldman sachs and external legal counsel wachtell lipton since a thwarted takeover attempt by j c penney in 1996 those advisers had been engaged when target spun off daytonhudson and mervyn’s they were well acquainted with the company and had gained the trust of its board thus target could feel confident that it was on a sound strategic course and justified in denying ackman’s demands and that management and the board could prevail in the proxy fight build board chemistry activist investors are often out to divide a target company’s board to address the issues they raise in an objective and constructive manner directors need the unity that comes from years of building board chemistry that chemistry is enhanced through repeated engagement on important issues weathering crises together and candid dialogue with the ceo the latter requires a high degree of transparency from the ceo and a willingness to share even the most sensitive information involved in decision making to cope with an activist’s challenges directors must be fully committed to the company and its longterm objectives just such board commitment chemistry and communication with the ceo enabled whole foods market wfm to survive a perfect storm of business troubles bad publicity and hedge fund activism in 2008 and 2009 since its 1978 inception as a single natural foods store in austin texas whole foods had grown rapidly its samestore sales ever increasing as it evolved into a fullscale supermarket chain concentrating on healthful foods with little previous business experience wfm’s cofounder john mackey had established a board composed of retailing veterans and knowledgeable financial investors with stakes in the company board chemistry developed as they advised mackey on how to build the whole foods franchise board commitment chemistry and communication with the ceo enabled whole foods market to survive a perfect storm of business troubles bad publicity and hedge fund activism after three decades of almost unbroken success the 2008 recession coupled with customer perceptions that whole foods was highpriced slowed the company’s samestore sales growth by three or four percentage points wfm had also been criticized in michael pollan’s bestselling guide to sustainable eating the omnivore’s dilemma 2006 just as whole foods was trying to get federal trade commission approval for its acquisition of wild oats a smaller grocery chain it came to light that mackey had pseudonymously disparaged wild oats in postings on the internet between january 2006 and november 2008 wfm stock dropped by 90 at that time the company brought in a friendly outside investor leonard green  partners seeing the dramatic fall in stock price the activist investor ron burkle bought 98 million shares 7 of the total and put pressure on the whole foods board to increase nearterm earnings by slowing growth but the board did not flinch it united behind mackey and wfm’s mission and values and rejected burkle’s demands it did however make several changes mackey stepped down as chairman but retained the title of ceo and the following year walter robb became his coceo whole foods’ directors were able to resist burkle’s challenges in part because of their unity and chemistry and the constructive actions they took the company appears to be better off as a result in the past four years samestore sales have increased annually by high single digits revenue has grown by 50 and earnings per share have tripled wfm stock hit a new alltime high last fall having risen 750 since these changes were made perform in the short run against declared goals ultimately the best defense against an activist investor is consistent performance that realizes the company’s stated goals anything else makes the company vulnerable j c penney’s mediocre performance under ceo myron “mike” ullman—its stock declined by 65 from 2007 to 2010—encouraged bill ackman to buy a significant position in the company consequently the board agreed to ackman’s demand for a change in management which led to an even worse situation but the company would never have attracted that kind of outside attention had it continued to perform the procter  gamble board’s decision in may 2013 to replace ceo bob mc donald was also triggered by challenges from ackman which included a detailed report on how pg could accelerate its earnings pg was vulnerable because of lackluster performance under mc donald from 2009 through 2012 a period during which the company frequently changed its strategic course in hopes of stimulating revenue growth although mc donald boosted pg stock in 2012 with a 10 billion cost reduction plan the board decided to replace him with former ceo a g lafley had pg pursued a more aggressive transformation soon after mc donald took over as unilever has done under paul polman that change might not have been made these examples and many others like them demonstrate the importance of solid performance at the same time it’s crucial to set realistic expectations many corporations trip up by publicly announcing overly ambitious goals or giving aggressive guidance to the market in today’s environment companies and boards would be well advised to consider either skipping earnings guidance altogether or giving it with a range of outcomes that take into account the uncertainties they face don’t dismiss activist ideas out of hand most activist investors are smart motivated people who often notice things that boards and managers overlook it is generally worth listening to their recommendations and implementing the ones that make sense for example in december 2006 ralph whitworth of relational investors learned about the aflcio’s campaign against the big paychecks home depot ceo robert nardelli was getting despite the company’s poor performance whitworth asked his staff to examine home depot as a possible target its analysis uncovered an accounting error in the company’s 10k and a low return on assets at home depot’s new wholesale division further reading the boardroom’s quiet revolution boards feature richard d parsons and marc a feigen four innovations that can help boards dramatically improve governance save share relational investors then took a small stake in home depot and wrote a letter to the board of directors asking for an opportunity to explain its findings the board met with whitworth and was stunned to learn that the accounting error had resulted in the company’s reporting twice its actual return on invested capital these events led to nardelli’s departure shortly thereafter and whitworth’s longtime colleague david batchelder was named to the board home depot subsequently embraced several changes whitworth had recommended including focusing on its core retail business establishing sounder capitalallocation processes and disciplines and making its business strategy more transparent to investors under its new ceo frank blake home depot exited the wholesale business in june 2007 revitalized customer service and initiated a 225 billion stock buyback program since blake took over the company’s stock has doubled the lesson here is that sometimes activists have good ideas and boards should take the time to understand what is being proposed doing what’s best for all your shareholders one of a board’s most important roles is to ensure that the company stays true to the mission and values that have made it successful in recent years several activist fund managers with no industry experience have come to corporations with proposals for radical unproven course changes sometimes major changes are needed but companies that allow outside activists to implement them without full and careful consideration risk losing the commitment and engagement of their employees and customers that is what happened at j c penney when ackman effectively took it over in 2010 he had no experience in managing retail businesses but elaborate plans for revolutionizing and revitalizing this one first he replaced ullman as ceo with ron johnson apple’s senior vice president of retailing operations then he and johnson changed penney’s pricing model eliminating coupons and large markdowns the results were disastrous for sales and profits and for ackman’s investment which declined by almost 500 million now ullman is back in charge of a muchdiminished company similarly the hedge fund manager edward lampert took over sears in 2005 and made major changes after merging the company with kmart lampert cycled through four ceos none of whom had retail experience he split sears into more than 30 business units each with its own president board and profitandloss statement on the theory that this would promote accountability instead it brought chaos as units competed against one another for company funds and other resources in january 2013 lampert made himself ceo causing forbes to label him the thirdworst “ceo screwup” of 2013 just below ron johnson the brazilian billionaire turned millionaire eike batista of ebx group took first place activist investors are very smart people but they rarely have the experience and wisdom to run large corporations as these examples illustrate because the activists usually cash out their holdings shortly after their demands are accepted or rejected the question remains whether most of them are committed to companies’ future success the risk is significant that their initiatives can weaken a company’s competitive position to the detriment of longterm shareholders and the highleverage financing structures they often propose may put companies in jeopardy in the event of an economic downturn the new activists are not going away anytime soon no doubt they will play an integral part in the stock market for years to come as illustrated by the recent experiences of procter  gamble with ackman and apple with first david einhorn’s greenlight capital and then carl icahn no company should feel immune to their challenges boards and management teams are better able to handle these challenges if they have prepared for them recently warren buffett offered some sage advice on the subject “i believe in running the company for shareholders that are going to stay” he said “rather than the ones that are going to leave” when approached by an activist investor directors should remember their fiduciary duty to the company and all its shareholders—not just the most meddlesome ones—and work to ensure the longterm viability of the company’s mission and strategy a version of this article appeared in the may
