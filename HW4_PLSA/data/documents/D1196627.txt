neurotologist otoneurologists and otologists vestibular migraine vmgeneral discussionmethanol 20130912 174109 utc 1are above three one and the samesarahd 20130913 154047 utc 2i think that neurotologists and otologists are the same they are ents who have fellowship training in ear and balance problems otoneurologists are neurologists who have special training in ear and balance problems i think that is right to treat mav the best person would be an otoneurologist the others won’t usually know that much about the medications they can probably diagnose you but might not be able to treat you dizzy for life 20130913 165339 utc 3otologists are not the same they specialize in diseases of the ear but do not have the cross training in neurology neurootology and otoneurology are two different terms for the same specialty as far as i know httpwwwmasseyeandearorgspecialtiesotolaryngologyotoneurology use the two terms interchangeably nancyw 20130913 185317 utc 4some use “otoneurologist” and “neurootologist” or neurotologist interchangeably but actually they are different sarah got it right–otoneurologists are neurologists by training with additional traininginterest in the inner ear and its connections to the brain neurootologists are ents by training surgeons with additional traininginterest in the inner ear and its connections to the brain an otoneurologist should be the ideal person to treat migrainerelated dizziness but i think it really depends on the practitioner and their knowledge and interest i don’t think all otoneurologists are created equal in their knowledge of and interest in vestibular migraine certainly the same with neurootologists also spelled neurotologist an otologist is an ear specialist generally a neurootologist is a specialist in the inner ear including dizziness and hearing loss i am not sure but i think the american board of otolaryngology gives an added certification in “otologyneurotology” for those who have the additional neuro training if you’re looking for a doctor best thing is to ask on this board for recommendations in your area and also call your nearest teaching hospital ask your primarycare doctor

quote very interesting thank you i wonder why some hospitals use otoneurology and neurootology as interchangeable eg both being a neurological subspecialty of otolaryngology is there a regional difference in terminology or do some lump them together to make it less confusing for potential patientsmethanol 20130913 221639 utc 6thank you nancy for the detailed answer unfortunately i live in a backward area of india there are no neurotologists or otoneurologists here i can find only ents nancyw 20130914 015754 utc 7sorry to hear that methanol still there must be some ents throughout india with an interest in dizziness and migraine are you able to travelentindiainfo200912associ … of12html nancyw 20130914 020554 utc 8dizzyforlife i don’t know why mass eye and ear uses the terms interchangeably their site refers to otoneurology but then says it’s sometimes called neurootology yet their specialists listed in that service are all boardcertified in neurology weird to me it doesn’t make sense to conflate neurotologists with otoneurologists any more than to conflate ents with neurologistsmethanol 20130914 065616 utc 9nancy i am able to do almost everything normal healthy people can but the thing is that this 247 unsteadinessrocking bothers me a lot i am currently seeing an ent who specializes in otology but she seems quite inexperienced here is her web site vertigoandearcliniccomnancyw 20130914 225911 utc 10her site says she’s done a fellowship in otology and neurotology which is what ents here do too as far as i know so it sounds like she’s a real neurotologist the right person to see although of course even such specialists can differ greatly among themselves as to knowledge interests experiences and “favorite” diagnoses i think a lot depends on who they trained under and how openminded and curious they themselves are best of luck to younancy
