in michael jackson’s new york times obituary the singer is credited with selling a hundred million copies of his most popular album “thriller”—and with selling an “estimated” seven hundred and fifty million records worldwide over his career in a new book on jackson “untouchable” the writer randall sullivan repeats the hundredmillion figure for “thriller” and earlier this year fan sites were a buzzing with the news that the michael jackson estate had “confirmed” that jackson had sold a total of a billion records musicindustry sales figures are a complex subject but this doesn’t excuse the fact that they are often exaggerated for public consumption the numbers surrounding jackson have always been particularly outlandish i was amused for example while reading a memoir by jackson’s record producer quincy jones “q on producing” to see that “thriller” had sold a hundred million copies—and then a few pages later that it had sold a hundred and twenty million i was sure by the end up of the book it would have risen to a hundred and fifty million as for that billion figure that came from a press release for jackson’s estate a couple of years ago which asserted in passing and with no documentation that the singer had sold an “estimated” billion records let’s look at facts starting with “thriller” when you hear the words “platinum” and “gold” in relation to record sales they are based on certifications from the record industry association of america known as the r i a a the group audits shipments of cds and in the past albums and cassettes and gives those awards based on what’s boxed up and trucked out of the pressing plants gold represents five hundred thousand units shipped and platinum a million again that’s shipped not actually sold “thriller” has been certified platinum in the united states twentynine times as of 2009 at the numbers jackson has sold over the past nearly thirty years the difference between units sold and shipped wouldn’t be that large but in the predigital era it was pretty common for an album that had sold say eight hundred thousand to get certified platinum—and then have the extra two hundred thousand returned unsold to the label and end up in the cutout bins in the nineteenseventies and eighties the famous billboard charts were compiled by phone surveys of recordstore employees who were just asked “what was selling” i was one of them since 1991 album sales in the u s have been counted by a company called sound scan which records the actual purchases of cds in sales in actual stores sound scan showed that the traditional charts had been based on many misconceptions we saw that overlooked genres like country and gospel were ringing up massive sales we also learned that we didn’t have an accurate picture of buying patterns before sound scan it was extremely rare for an album to début at no 1 on the charts after we had the real figures we saw that it was in fact routine to this day anticipated releases by major stars open at no 1 and typically have their highest sales that first week for “thriller” we have r i a a data as of 2009 representing at least twentynine million albums how about since jackson died billboard citing sound scan figures reported two years after jackson’s death that “thriller” had sold about two million more it’s still selling so at this point it’s safe to say it’s sold in the neighborhood of thirtytwo million or so in the united states but what about overseas could jackson have sold another seventy million albums in other countries it’s doubtful i occasionally consult with a french music fan guillaume vieira who in his off hours as a web developer obsessively collects sales news from labels and official industry statements all over the globe he charts the figures carefully culls more data from a network of sources in the industry in various countries and analyzes national sales patterns to fill in the blanks i have no way of checking all of his figures of course but his methodology strikes me as more persuasive than the selfserving assertions of record labels vieira totals up fifteen million copies of “thriller” sold in europe three million in asia and so forth—and finds that jackson might have sold an additional thirtyfive million or so around the globe here are some of his 2009 data points—before jackson’s death—in an exhaustive post written under the nom de data mj dangerous vieira’s research is now being collected at a site called fan of music  for “thriller” to have sold anything close to a hundred million copies there would have to be another thirtyfive to forty million in sales out there that somehow have eluded official notice that amount in itself would be as much as one of the biggestselling albums of all time the hundredmillion figure is in all likelihood a lot of hooey so how many records—albums singles and downloads—did jackson sell in total a tougher question classicera motown refused to have its sales audited by the industry so there are no official gold and platinum figures from this era vieira says that the jackson 5 sold a bit less than fifty million singles and fifty million albums for the label jackson had a solo career at motown with hits like “ben” and “got to be there” and then further success with his brothers on epic records recording as the jacksons then came his momentous adult solo career beginning with the albums “off the wall” and “thriller”did jackson sell a billion records or even seven hundred and fifty million sure “thriller” sold a lot of copies but jackson recorded infrequently and his later albums sold nowhere near what “thriller” did we know from sound scan figures that jackson was selling on average roughly a million albums a year in the nineteennineties and the aughts in the u s—and that includes greatesthits albums like the fourmillionselling “number ones” that’s not nothing but it’s not the sort of thing that adds up to a billion records over time vieira’s data collection encompasses sales of albums singles videos ringtones and digital downloads all the way back to jackson’s time with the jackson 5 he found that around the time jackson died jackson had sold about four hundred million records give or take since jackson’s death he’s moved some forty million albums and fifty million song downloads plus a lot of dvds and ringtones for a total more or less of roughly five hundred and fifteen million sold that’s about the same as the five hundred millionplus credited to the beatles but less than any of the cumulative totals of the individual beatles ringo included paul mc cartney vieira says has total sales of some six hundred and seventy million i am always happy to exchange emails with vieira so i asked him what based on his research the other bestselling albums worldwide were here’s his list michael jackson “thriller” 66200000soundtrack “grease” 44700000pink floyd “the dark side of the moon” 44200000whitney houston et al

perennial seller along with the everpopular “the dark side of the moon” those two albums seem safe at the no 2 and 3 slots will they and “thriller” be there forever the digital era has also brought back the availability of the single music fans no longer have to shell out for the whole album when they just want a song or two it’s hard to see how numbers like those can be matched vieira takes a different view although i would be contradicted by many on that point yes it is still easily possible to sell as many records as “thriller” “d s o t m” or “grease” those albums are blockbusters—albums that reach groundbreaking sales eg uncommon sales given the market if we look at the years 1975 to 2005 the worst year for album sales worldwide was 1982—the year “thriller” was released on the other side if you look at bestselling albums released on each of those years the weakest is 2001’s top seller shakira’s “laundry service” with less than twelve million despite the biggest year for album sales of all time being… 2001 it means that market size has little to do with bestsellers market size is mostly dependent on the number of regular buyers which is massively low at the moment but blockbusters find their limits on the number of potential buyers not regular ones which is at an alltime high at the moment adele ended up selling exactly the same as “saturday night fever” did when it was released slightly more than “grease” and over three times more than what “d s o t m” sold during its first two years what about china or india i asked—could a jacksonsize phenom emerge from either country each with a population far bigger than that of the united states definitely nothing crazy happening in china and india despite massive number of inhabitants their markets are pretty weak similar to australia or lower in the golden age of the nineties some local acts reached sales of three or four million in china like their “local michael jackson” jacky cheung with “the goodbye kiss” arguably the bestselling album ever in continental asia and around two million in india but those are the bestselling albums ever there i can see adele selling another thirty million albums over the next twenty years and coming up close to “grease” or “d s o t m” but leaving aside some astonishing phenomenon that sweeps the world jackson’s “thriller” will forever remain in its position at no 1—and it doesn’t need for its sales to be exaggerated to stay there bill wyman who recently wrote about michael jackson for the magazine is the former arts editor of saloncom and national public radio
