labour law  know your rights a termination termination of employment at the instance of a party to the contract may be terminated only on a notice of not less than one week if the employee has been employed for six months or lesstwo weeks if the employee has been employed for more than six months but not more than one yearfour weeks if the employee has been employed for one year or more or in the case of a farmworker or domestic worker  employed for more than six months these notice periods are the minimum and may not be shortened by any agreement however section 37 2 b does provides that a collective agreements may permit the notice period of four weeks to be reduced to not less than two weeks the employer may not impose on the employee a notice period that does not also equally apply to the employer in other words if the employment contract stipulates that the employee must give 2 months notice for termination of the contract then the employer must also give the employee 2 months notice if the employer wishes to terminate the contract or dismisses the employee termination of a contract of employment must be given in writing except when it is given to or by any illiterate employee notice of termination of employment when given by the employer must not be given during any period of leave to which the employee is entitled  and may not run concurrently with any period of leave to which the employee is entitled except sick leave put differently if an employer dismisses an employee and the employee has annual leave due to him the employer may not require that the dismissed employee take the outstanding annual leave during the period of notice the employer is required to pay out the employee for this leave however should the employee require sick leave during a period of notice and heshe has sick leave days available then the employee is entitled to take paid sick leave during a period of notice b hours of work and overtime the following is applicable to employees earning less than the determined threshold the maximum normal working time allowed is 45 hours weekly this is 9 hours per day excluding lunch break if the employee works a fiveday week and 8 hours per day excluding lunch break if the employee works more than 5 days per week this does not mean that the employee must work 45 hours per week normal time the amount of normal time worked is a matter of contractual agreement between employer and employee some employers work a 40 hour week and so on the statutory limitation of 45 hours per week means that the employee may not work more than 45 hours per week normal time lunch break is unpaid time and is the employees own time  heshe may read a book go shopping etc because they are not paid for lunch breaks therefore an employee who works a 5 day week and who receives a lunch break of one hour daily will actually be at the workplace for 50 hours weekly 45 hours normal working time plus 5 hours daily lunch breaks the lunch break is to be provided after five hours continuous working time tea breaks do not qualify as a break in working time the statutory lunch break is 1 hour but by agreement between the employee and employer this may be reduced to 30 minutes employees who earn above the determined threshold amount must negotiate the normal amount of working hours per day or per week with the employer the employee is under no obligation to work more than 45 hours per week overtime all overtime is voluntary and may only be worked by agreement between employer and employee maximum permissible overtime is 3 hours on anyone day or 10 hours in any 1 week remuneration must be at 1 5 times the normal wage rate except for sunday work and work on public holidays which must be remunerated at twice the normal wage rate time off calculated on the same formula may be granted instead of payment but only by agreement with the employee employees who earn in excess of the present threshold amount are not subject to the provisions of section 10 overtime of the basic conditions of employment act this means that such employees cannot demand to be paid for overtime worked nor can they demand to be granted paid time off in view of payment however contrary to popular belief the employer also cannot force such employees to work overtime and cannot demand that they work overtime without compensation all forced labour is prohibited in terms of section 48 of the bcea and should the employer require such employees to work overtime then the hours to be worked and the basis of compensation must be negotiated with the employee should the employer refuse to compensate for overtime worked in the case of an over the threshold employee then the employee is entitled to refuse to work the overtime what is overtime worked all hours worked in excess of the employees normal hours of work will be regarded as overtime hours therefore if your employee is contracted to work 45 hours per week normal time then any hours in excess of that is overtime worked similarly if your employee is contracted to work 40 hours per week normal time then any hours in excess of the 40 hours is overtime worked overtime on short notice overtime is not compulsory and employees can refuse to work overtime on short notice however an employee cannot refuse to work overtime if the work which is required to be done must be done without delay owing to circumstances for which the employer could not reasonably have been expected to make provision such as the sudden breakdown of equipment and which cannot be performed by employees during the ordinary hours of work section 6 2 bcea remuneration for sunday and public holiday work should any employee work on a sunday he must be remunerated at double his normal wage rate for each hour worked unless he ordinarily works on a sunday in which case he must be remunerated at 1 5 times his normal wage rate for each our worked should any employee work on a public holiday it must be noted that no employer may require any employee to work on a public holiday except in accordance with an agreement with the employee to do so if the public holiday falls on a day on which the employee would normally work the employee is entitled to that day off on full pay or if he does not work on that day then he is entitled to be paid his ordinarily daily wage plus the amount earned by him for the work performed on that day should the public holiday fall on a day on which the employee would ordinarily work then if he works on that public holiday he is entitled to be paid at least double his normal wage rate for the day or if he does not work he is entitled to have the day off and be paid his normal wage rate for the day c have the power of the ccma behind younot understanding of the commission for conciliation mediation and arbitration and its processes can deny the public use of the accessible and low cost service the commission renders and may cause some frustration the ccma is an independent body established by law to carry out a range of workplace dispute resolution and prevention functions the ccma is open to use by both employees and employers in dispute disputes can also be referred by unions or employer organisations over matters such as freedom of associationorganisational rightscollective agreementsmutual interest issuesunfair dismissalsunfair labour practices and unfair discrimination before referring a dispute to the ccma parties need to attempt to settle the dispute on their own by following and completing all internal company procedures aimed at resolving workplace disputesensure that all the legal requirements are metparties are also encouraged to determine the strengths of the case before referring the dispute to the ccma if it is a dismissal dispute to avoid referring cases that have no strengths this can be done by discussing the matter with a union official or asking a university law clinic for adviceconsider whether the dispute falls under the ccmas jurisdiction and refer it appropriately examples of issues not covered by the ccma are disputes over nonpayment of salarieswages handled by the department of labour disputes covered by collective agreements and disputes covered by a bargaining council or a private dispute resolution body disputes involving independent contractors  the ccma only covers employees as defined in the lra if it is a dismissal dispute make sure you complete the required forms and refer your dispute to the ccma for conciliation within 30 days of the date of dismissal or if it is a later date within 30 days of the employer finally deciding to dismiss you or uphold your dismissal if it is an unfair labour practice dispute refer your dispute to the ccma within 90 days of the unfair labour practice or within 90 days of you becoming aware of what you believe is an unfair labour practice the 30 or 90 days are calculated by counting all days including weekends and public holidays ensure that you refer your case in time complete and serve the ccma referral form lra 711 correctly you may ask your nearest ccma office or employers organisation to help you complete the form how to serve and file the

on 0861161616 or hoccmaorgza d employee rights did you know that as an employee you have rights we are all aware or should be aware of the common law rights such as the right to be treated with dignity and respect the right not to be unfairly dismissed the right not to be victimised and the right not to be unfairly discriminated against but what about those rights that are entrenched in law those rights that are printed in an act of parliament such as the basic conditions of employment act just in case you dont know section 78 of the bcea reads as follows 1 every employee has the right to a make a complaint to a trade union representative a trade union official or a labour inspector concerning any alleged failure or refusal by an employer to comply with this act b discuss his or her conditions of employment with his or her fellow employees his or her employer or any other person c refuse to comply with an instruction that is contrary to this act or any sectoral determination d refuse to agree to any term or conditions of employment that is contrary to this act or any sectoral determination e inspect any record kept in terms of this act that relates to the employment of that employee f participate in proceedings in terms of this act g request a trade union representative order a labour inspector to inspect any record in terms of this act and that relates to the employment of that employee 2 every trade union representative has the right at the request of an employee to inspect any record kept in terms of this act that relates to the employment of that employee the basic conditions of employment act goes further in section 79 to afford certain protection to employees in exercising of their rights section 79 2 goes on to state as follows 2 no person may discriminated against an employee  including a former employee or an applicant for employment for exercising a right conferred by this part and in no person may do or threaten to do any of the following a require an employee not to exercise a right conferred by this part b prevent an employee from exercising a right conferred by this part or c prejudice an employee because of a past present or anticipated – i failure or refusal to do anything that an employer may not lawfully promote or require an employee to do ii disclosure of information that the employee is lawfully entitled or required to give to another person or iii exercise of a right conferred by this part 3 no person may favour or promise to favour an employee in exchange for the employee not exercising a right conferred by this part what do these rights mean to the employer the employee has the right to make a complaint to a trade union representative a trade union official or a labour inspector concerning any alleged failure or refusal by an employer to comply with this act for example should the employer fail to provide the employee with a pay slip on every payday or should the employer fail to complete the pay slip in terms of the requirements set out by the act or should the employer fail to provide the employee with the written particulars of employment as required in chapter four of the act and so on and so forth then the employee has the right to complain either to his shop steward and request the shop steward to take action or he can lodge a complaint direct with the trade union or he can lodge a complaint with the department of labour the department of labour will then take the necessary action to force the employer to comply with the requirements of the act the employee has the right to discuss his or her conditions of employment with his or her fellow employees his or her employer or any other person the employee’s conditions of employment include his salary he is therefore permitted by law to discuss his salary with his workmates or any other person this rather puts a damper on the traditional “ salaries are confidential and may not be discussed with anybody” rule that has existed in most companies for centuries the employee has the right to refuse to comply with an instruction that is contrary to this act or any sectoral determination this means that should you request such an employee to work overtime when he is just about to knock off unless it is absolute emergency overtime the employee would have the right to refuse and there is nothing you can do about it this would apply to any instruction that is contrary to the provisions of the act  the employee has a right to refuse to comply and generally you would not be able to take disciplinary action for insubordination the employee has the right to refuse to agree to any term or conditions of employment that is contrary to this act or any sectoral determination many employers still have rules and regulations in place emanating from “ the old days” such as a requirement that if the employee does not arrive at work on the day before or the day after a public holiday then he does not get paid for the public holiday or the rule that if any employee is off sick on a friday or a monday or if he is off sick the day before or the day after a public holiday then he must produce a medical certificate in both instances there is absolutely no provision whatsoever in the basic conditions of employment act for the employer to act as above and the employee would therefore be justified in refusing to produce a medical certificate or in demanding that the he be paid for the public holiday in the above circumstances we now take a further look at some of the additional rights of employees in terms of the basic conditions of employment act the employee has the right to inspect any record kept in terms of this act that relates to the employment of that employee this means basically that if necessary an employee is entitled to inspect his personal file held in hr he may wish to do this for example after a disciplinary hearing in order to inspect his previous disciplinary record or to obtain some information from his file in preparing an appeal the employee is entitled to participate in proceedings in terms of this act such proceedings may include retrenchment consultations wage negotiations inspections being carried out by a labour inspector and so on the employee is entitled to request a trade union representative or a labour inspector to inspect any record in terms of this act and that relates to the employment of that employee this would mean that if the employee feels that some or other information or record contained in his personal file does not comply with the act he would be entitled to request a labour inspector to inspect the record and order any amendments that may be necessary the same condition applies to every trade union representative who has the right at the request of an employee to inspect any record kept in terms of this act that relates to the employment of that employee the above does not really present a problem for the employer and i think most employers will agree that employees have very seldom if ever exercised any of the above rights one reason for this may be that employees do not know their rights a further right which may cause a bit of concern is that  no person may discriminate against an employee  including a former employee or an applicant for employment for exercising a right conferred by this part” the area where employers must be careful here is that this includes an applicant for employment” thus employers must be careful in their review and shortlisting procedures because even an applicant for employment does have certain rights in terms of the act no person  including no employer may a require an employee not to exercise a right conferred by this part b prevent an employee from exercising a right conferred by this part thus it would be unlawful for an employer to attempt to persuade an employee not to exercise his rights in terms of the act and it would be unlawful for the employer to go further than verbal persuasion and resort to other methods to prevent an employee from exercising his rights in terms of the act the way to overcome this when an employee wishes to exercise his rights in terms of the act would be to sit around the table and negotiate with the employee in an effort to resolve the cause of the dispute it is far better to do that than to be issued with one or more compliance orders by the department of labour finally no employer may prejudice an employee because of a past present or anticipated failure or refusal to do anything that an employer may not lawfully promote or require an employee to do what this means is that an employer may not for example refuse an employee a promotion or salary increase or bonus because the employee has previously presently or anticipates refusing to do anything unlawful that the employer requires him to do for more information contact derek on advicelabourguidecoza
