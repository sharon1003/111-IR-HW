apostrophes are primarily used to show possession though they have a number of other common uses as well possessive case the primary use of the apostrophe is to indicate the possessive case singular possessive to form a possessive with a singular noun use an apostrophe followed by an s examples my aunt’s home is in montana our supervisor’s name is joshua this is generally true even if the word itself ends with an s still add an apostrophe and s examples have you seen marcus’s report we reviewed james’s work yesterday on the other hand some writers prefer to omit the s after the apostrophe whenever a word already ends in s or z though this guideline is easy to follow it does not follow the norms of pronunciation and it can therefore seem unnatural examples last night we had dinner at mr lewis’ home he loves to read about jesus’ miracles have you read mr chavez’ report plural possessive to create plural possessive nouns when the words end with an s add just an apostrophe never add an apostrophe and an s to a plural noun that already ends in s not the managers’s meeting will be tomorrow the board members’s recommendations were well received but the managers’ meeting will be tomorrow the board members’ recommendations were well received for plural nouns that do not end with an s add an apostrophe followed by an s do not write the apostrophe after the s not your childrens’ song was beautiful the gentlemens’ suggestions were outrageous but your children’s song was beautiful the gentlemen’s suggestions were outrageous for a more thorough discussion of possessives see the article entitled “possessive nouns and indefinite pronouns”indefinite pronouns use an apostrophe plus s to create the possessive case of indefinite pronouns indefinite pronouns are pronouns that do not refer to any particular person or thing such as somebody anybody someone anything something and so forth examples i found someone’s keys on the desk over there have you heard anyone’s suggestions yet about what to do for the summer social for more information see the article entitled “indefinite pronouns”abbreviations to create the possessive form for the abbreviation of a singular noun add an apostrophe plus s examples that cpa’s salary is twice what mine is i’m not sure i understand the mdra’s mission generally do not use an apostrophe plus s to create the plural form of an abbreviation not there were three cpa’s at the meeting do you know how many students received their mba’s last year have you met any of the rn’s but there were three cpas at the meeting do you know how many students received their mbas last year have you met any of the rns however if the abbreviation has both capital and lowercase letters or has two or more periods then an apostrophe should be used to avoid misreading example all of my brothers earned ph d’s to make the plural possessive form of an abbreviation add an apostrophe after the s only examples have you heard the cpas’ recommendations we understand the rns’ want to change their schedules plural letters and words to pluralize a letter or a word used as a word italicize the letter or word and use roman type for the final s generally no apostrophe is used to make the plural form of a word or an uppercase letter examples do you realize how many heretofore s are in this affidavit i don’t appreciate all of the maybe s i keep hearing of course you should capitalize the c s in the carlton company however where the plural form of the capitalized letter might be misread if the apostrophe were omitted then include it example i think that there are two capital i ’s in inter index when referring to letters used to represent scholastic grades the letters are capitalized and left in roman type an apostrophe is typically not necessary to create the plural form though it is used after a so as not to confuse it with the word as example he received three a’s two bs and two cs our son received two i’s last semester an apostrophe generally is used for ease in reading however when creating the plural form of lowercase letters examples there are two t ’s and two c ’sin the word fettuccini are those two e ’s in that word plural numbers to make the plural form of a number add an s without the apostrophe example they like to skate figure 8s at the ice rink how many perfect 100s have you scored contractions the apostrophe is also used to replace the missing letters in a contraction example he said he couldn’t make it to the meeting this morning i haven’t seen her yet but i’m sure she is around here somewhere contractions are common in speech and informal writing and many writers include them even in formal text to give the work a more conversational or relaxed tone however some readers disapprove of contractions in formal writing so pay attention to the purpose of your document and the audience for whom it is intended when writing a contraction where the apostrophe comes at the very beginning of the word make sure that an apostrophe and not an opening single quotation mark which is the default character that will be inserted by most word processors is used not‘tis the best time of the year filled with happiness and cheer but’tis the best time of the year filled with happiness and cheer such constructions are generally reserved for poetry and other forms of informal writing years an apostrophe again not an opening single quote is used to indicate the omission of the first two digits of a year not his wife graduated two years before he did in ‘75 do you remember the tornado of ‘05 but his wife graduated two years before he did in ’75 do you remember the tornado of ’05 however do not omit the first two digits of the year if it might be unclear to readers which century is meant decades an apostrophe should not be used before the s when referring to the years of a particular decade examples he is definitely a child of the 1980s her grandfather was a teenager during the 1950s plural form in quotation marks the plural form of a word or phrase in quotations marks may look awkward and thus the sentence should probably be revised to avoid this construct if the plural form is retained however then an apostrophe plus s should be included within the quotation marks never on the outside of the quotation marks original with the state of marriage in this country are there any “till death do us part’s” anymore better with the state of marriage in this country does anybody even make it to “till death do us part” anymore misused apostrophes sometimes writers mistakenly add an apostrophe where one does not belong following are instances where an apostrophe should not be used do not use an apostrophe for nouns that are not possessive this error sometimes occurs when a possessive pronoun appears in the sentence however a possessive pronoun does not necessarily mean that a nearby noun should also be in the possessive case rather it depends on the grammatical function of the noun not their nephews’ all live in the midwest mr jenkins’s sons’ and their wives visited here yesterday our pets’ are like our surrogate children but their nephews all live in the midwest mr jenkins’s sons and their wives visited here yesterday our pets are like our surrogate children do not use an apostrophe for the possessive form of the personal pronouns its whose his hers ours yours or theirs these words do not contain apostrophes even though they are in the possessive case not i did not know that their department had combined with our’s liz said that their’s is a more relaxed working environment but i did not know that their department had combined with ours liz said that theirs is a more relaxed working environment the word it’s is the contraction of it is and the word who’s is the contraction of who is do not confuse these two words with the possessive forms its and whose which do not contain apostrophes despite being in the possessive case not every department has it’s own policies and procedures to handle such circumstances i don’t know who’s shirts these are that just arrived from the dry cleaner but every department has its own policies and procedures to handle such circumstances i don’t know whose shirts these are that just arrived from the dry cleaner nor should apostrophes be used with the personal pronouns your their or theirs be careful not to confuse these words with the contraction you’re they’re and there’s not what you’re colleagues said was inexcusable we have not heard they’re response yet do you know which car is there’s but what your colleagues said was inexcusable we have not heard their response yet do you know which car is theirs finally presenttense verbs used with thirdperson singular subjects always end in s and do not ever have an apostrophe not our office boast’s some of the best talent in the nation their yard look’s beautiful when all the flowers are in bloom but our office boasts some of the best talent in the nation their yard looks beautiful when all the flowers are in bloom try our lettertemplate software risk free for 30days when you buy at write expresscom if you’re not satisfied return it for a full refund good
