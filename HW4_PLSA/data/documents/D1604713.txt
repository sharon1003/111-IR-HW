why i don’t like steel cut oats published january 17 2014  by neily neily’s easy steel cut oats recipe belowokay that title is a bit harsh and perhaps misleading let me explain a number of years ago a client told me she didn’t eat oatmeal because of not having time to make steel cut oats she had heard—by an illinformed friend—that if she couldn’t eat steel cut oats not to bother reason number one i ‘don’t like’ steel cut oats—someone not eating a nutrientrich food like oatmeal because she was told if she couldn’t eat steel cut not to bother i absolutely love oats as part of a healthy breakfast it has a ‘stick to your ribs’ quality that you just don’t get with cold cereal more than 75 percent of fiber in most cold cereal is insoluble fiber—good for you without a doubt it’s what gives bulk to stool however roughly half the fiber in oatmeal is soluble fiber this betaglucan type of soluble fiber gives it a gummy consistency which effectively makes it helpful at lowering cholesterol that’s why oatmeal can bear a cholesterolreducing claim but all fiber—soluble and insoluble—is great at helping to manage weight i had another client tell me why he didn’t eat oatmeal he also was illinformed by a wellmeaning friend maybe they had the same friend who said steel cut was the only way to go because it was healthier but my client didn’t like the chewy consistency he just didn’t like the way steel cut tasted i’ve heard that before reason number two i ‘don’t like’ steel cut oats some don’t like the taste and others incorrectly believe steel cut oats are better for you nutritionally steel cut and rolled oats are no different the difference is in the processing and therefore texture from least to most processed here is a snapshot of oatswhole oat grains or kernels oat groats – oats are harvested and the outer hull is removedsteel cut oats or irish oats – oat groats are cut 2 to 3 times with a steel blade hence ‘steel cut’whole rolled oats – oat groats that have been steamed rolled under heavy rollers and lightly toastedquickcooking whole rolled oats – essentially whole rolled oats but smaller pieces that cook more quickly some may argue the glycemic index is lower with steel cut and it is but it’s not a significant variance can vary from brand to brand and in method of preparation furthermore i recommend using milk versus water and adding nuts for added fat—all of which will make the glycemic index irrelevant the bottom line—steel cut or regular—eat oats please do however avoid the prepackaged presweetened oatmeal compare the ingredient label of whole rolled oats in a drum versus the package one ingredient whole rolled oats versus four lines of ingredients look at the labels below in the same amount of time you can microwave ½ cup whole oats and then add your own sweetener fruit dried fruit nuts etc much better for you ingredient rolled oats note one ingredientartificial colors and flavors sugar artificial sweetener salt…what i tell people is to take plain oats and measure ½ cup portions into snack bags put the bags back in the drum grab and go you can also have the nuts and dried fruit ready to go the same way as well final thoughts to bump up the protein always make with nonfat or low fat milk or soy versus water avoid almond or rice milk—unless you must avoid dairy—which have negligible protein read my post why i don’t drink almond milk if interested avoid prepackaged oatmeal including plain just that extra processing adds ingredients you don’t need like sodium compare the two labels above steel cut have no extra nutrition clout some may say their low glycemic index make them better but all whole oats have a lower glycemic index any variance is insignificant don’t have time to make steel cut use a slow cooker and make them overnight—they’ll be ready in the morning make a big batch on the weekend portion out and freeze can also do with regular oatsneily’s easy steel cut oats makes two servings photo above i’m in dire need of a trip to the grocery store so would have added a bit of dried cranberries to this recipe if i had them½ cup dry steel cut oats bob’s red mill is the brand i happen to have1½ cups nonfat milk1 tablespoon brown sugar or less depending on desired sweetnesscinnamon to taste i use korintje cinnamon – a little goes a long way2 tablespoon almonds or walnuts directions heat milk to low boil on stove add oats reduce heat to low and simmer cover and stir every few minutes for 1520 minutes depending on desired texture the longer you cook the creamier the texture add in brown sugar and cinnamon to taste—a few easy shakes i’m not very good at cooking by absolute measures with spices turn heat off and let stand covered a few minutes spoon into bowl sprinkle with a bit more cinnamon and top

portioning out and putting back in the drum would be great for a household wteens to make it easy to fix a healthy breakfast reply lori mercen on march 15 2015 at 505 am it seems a shame to denounce a highly nutritious food based on a common misconception rolled oats go through several steps of extra processing which robs them of their nutrients of course rolled oats are still far superior to the average american breakfast but preparing them in the microwave is not a healthy choicea simple way to prepare steel cut outs is to bring the oats and water to boil first thing in the morning turn of the burner and come back later after showering and getting dressed the oats will then be almost ready to go and require just a few moments of simmering at the very end stir in milk or soy milk to increase protein and give a creamy consistency flax seeds and nuts can also be added at the end reply j meyer on january 13 2016 at 830 pm lori mercen your information is false rolled oats have the exact same amount of nutrients in them as steel cut you are completely misleading people who read your response because you are just plain wrong no nutrients are lost whatsoever in the rolled oats processing which is simply steaming them rolling them and slightly toasting them and microwaving them is not unhealthy either what a stupid thing to say that microwaving oatmeal is not healthy how does a microwave oven which simply uses a microwave to rapidly vibrate water molecules thence heating food up make any food unhealthy or bad for a person many things cooked in microwaves may end up an inferior tasting or textured dish just from the way it cooks food but it is not unhealthy or in any way detrimental to one’s health no more than any other method of cooking in fact a microwave oven can actually preserve nutrient content in some foods better than some other conventional methods these are facts reply neily on january 29 2016 at 1032 pm thank you j meyer replycupofjoe4me2 on february 19 2016 at 850 am using a microwave for your food is a bad choice period if it’s not healthy to stand in front of a microwave i certainly don’t want to put the things that i will be eating inside of it research the effects of microwaves on food and it is clear that it is not wise to eat anything heated in a microwave reply neily on february 22 2016 at 523 pm cooking in nonmicrowave safe containers is not a good idea but in appropriate microwave safe cookware no issue i would very much like to see the evidencebased research behind your claim reply scotty on february 3 2017 at 726 am in my opinion it makes more sense to not use a microwave until their is research backed evidence that it is not harmful to the food inside there’s no need to provide evidence that cooking over stoves as humans have done for centuries is healthy and i for one prefer to minimize radiation exposure especially when it’s something as simple as taking 10 minutes to cook oatmeal and now in regards to the glycemic index i believe rolled oats have a glycemic index of 62 vs 44 for steel cut oats which will potentially have a significant impact on blood sugar and therefore insulin release i can provide plenty of research backed evidence that insulin levels are one of the strongest predictors of obesity and other chronic diseases as well as development of diabetes it also explains how people can be metabolically unhealthy while underweight and healthy while overweight i do agree with you that rolled oats are exponentially healthier than the average american breakfast but to lie about the effects of a foods glycemic load and to imply that microwaves have been proven to be safe while their effects are still being studied is just irresponsible neily on february 4 2017 at 1107 am hi scotty – thanks for your thoughtful response i will stand by several previous discussions re gigl glycemic index is based upon values associated with individuals and different charts show varying information everyone’s body is different reacts differently and will have a different response to food a lower gigl certainly doesn’t make it healthier think ice cream…nothing wrong with it i love it but lower gi does not equal health…energy yes energycalories rarely do ppl eat steel cut oats buck naked – cooked with nothing added to them generally they’ll add some sweetness fruit etc fatprotein nuts eg adding fat andor protein are going to change the gi response since they don’t impact glucose like carbs do furthermore the action of salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase digestive enzymes is negligible at best check out my colleague dr jo’s 2part video on gi httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvs53xen rkzi and httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbphwo98z4 regarding your information about microwave ovens i’m just not going to go there i respect your decision not to use one – that is all i will say be well neily richard on april 8 2017 at 1010 am i put the food in the microwave i do not go in there…you did not cite one study that shows cooking with a microwave is not healthy the internet is full of articles that indicate it is healthy… reply am on january 11 2018 at 807 am hi unfortunately jm you are wrong cooking in microwave is extremely unhealthy and contributes to cancer there has not been enough research done as everything now is put into microwave but this is serious problem which will come to light in next 10 years i live in europe and places like uk have the most obese most unhealthy people if you compare with eg italy or france if you eat fake food which is sold preheated in mv  even in restaurants this food is damaged and cant be healthy please make deeper research and see speak to the experts  good dietician will tell you you can’t compare microwave cooking to the traditional cooking as its like comparing water melon to cabbage they sell quick and fake food everywhere this creates a lot of businesses and number of people getting cancer  or cancer related diseases increases year by year that they sell such food everywhere does not mean its healthy make your own choice for yourself my dietician from europe who is working with people in last 20 years told me  never ever eat from mv its bad that’s the end of it she have seen until now everything young kids having tumors in places you would not imagine and older people being disabled it’s simply bad they are still reluctant to make proper surveys and make it official on this subject as this will create a lot of problems and many businesses will be closed due to the fact that people slowly will stop buying wise people know stuff like this good luck for me life without mv works really well and you find out the difference once you try yourself fake food is not processed in your body and the residue stays within your body thus all unhealthy side effects good luck i wish you happy and healthy life reply neily on january 15 2018 at 548 am this dietitian will allay the fear of microwave ovens causing cancer they don’t i do encourage a whole food plant based diet – not necessarily vegetarian as i am not – but minimizing highly manufactured foodlike substances what you might call ‘fake food’reply harald forkbeard on june 25 2015 at 1107 pm box cereals are a major hoax as they are nothing but an overpriced just fast food no one should eat anything that comes out of a box indeed the big food spends more money on the packaging box than on the garbage that’s inside so steel cut oats being better is not saying much try harder reply jonathan brown on july 5 2015 at 410 am not only is your title misleading but your article is a load of crap i bet you were the ill informed friend talk about click bait at its finest useless drivel reply j meyer on january 13 2016 at 836 pm jonathan there is nothing misleading about the article and you sir are the one who is full of “it” do some research before you make a fool of yourself again because your response is “useless drivel” in the most literal sense reply neily on january 29 2016 at 1031 pm thank you j meyer for responding with what i would have liked to have said reply roxanne on february 6 2016 at 439 pm what part is misleading what are the points that are useless drivel your response has no rationale it has the substance of a toddler’s tantrum i am sorry that you are so angry but why burden others with your ranting reply richard on february 11 2017 at 908 am i agrede with what you said but not the way you said it i am sure that with some help you can learn to use a more polite tone and still get your point across by citing supporting specifics most people using the internet expect you to do all the research for them and list the urls so they can just click on them when you disagree with an article reply richard on april 8 2017 at 1013 am you have not included a single point that you disagree with and your tone is off color if you can not do better you should stop commenting…reply kacey wood on october 14 2015 at 420 pm i am confused if the difference is the processing – especially including heat – then i think the steel cut oats not processed must be better a processed food can never be the same as a food that has not been processed or am i wrong reply neily on november 1 2015 at 305 pm hi kacey – thank you for your comment steel cut are still ‘processed’ … simply cutting the oats is a form of processing steaming whole oats and toasting may slightly reduce nutritional value versus steel cut but the difference is negligible a major point of the article is to tell people all plain oats not the ones with added sugar are excellent some do not like the taste of steel cut or have the time to cook them just a side note i wonder about some of the newer quick cooking steel cut oats…not sure how they are doing that without precooking them also to your point “a processed food can never be the same as a food that has not been processed” actually that is incorrect interestingly some foods yield greater nutritional value when cooked like in the case of tomatoes cooking them breaks down the cell membrane releasing more of the phytochemical lycopene reply renato on august 26 2016 at 906 am perfectly spoken neily reply neily on august 31 2016 at 338 pm thank you reply ayesha bogart on october 15 2015 at 952 am i liked the article neily it was fun to read and interesting as well so thank you i feel there should be a more private platform for comments especially those lacking corrective criticism and decorum if i may offer a suggestion for those who did not enjoy the article take a look at her trademark you may not be be the intended audience this may help you decide which articles to read in the future and most certainly to which you should offer commentary merely a suggestion reply neily on november 1 2015 at 246 pm thank you for your kind words ayesha reply kelly on november 8 2015 at 606 am to simplify as you mentioned i cook a large batch of steelcut oats saturday morning to eat all week another cooking method to decrease cooking time is to soak overnight and then cook in the morning this decreases the cooking time to less than 10 minutes reply neily on november 9 2015 at 1051 pm that’s great idea kelly thanks for the tip neily reply kerry brown on november 10 2015 at 632 pm i am just now getting serious about healthy cooking at the age of 60 with diabetes yes very similar to closing the gate after the cows got out i love oatmeal i am not much of a plan ahead kinda guy for this reason i purchased a new style stove top pressure cooker i turn the gas burner on high drizzle some evoo into the cooker olive oil keeps the oats from foaming one cup steel cut oats and three cups purified water and attach the lid it takes 45 mins to get to pressure then i turn the burner to the lowest setting uses very little gas overall and ten minutes later they are done the new pressure cookers release almost no steam so all the nutrition stays in the oats and you can tell as a side note if you would like hard boiled eggs that just slide out of the shell every time even using farm fresh eggs and not smelly two week old eggs then pressure cook with steamer basket 5mins then ice water bath kreply neily on november 11 2015 at 1125 pm this is great information kelly congrats on being so accomplished with a pressure cooker – terrific way to cook oats – neily reply todd on july 14 2016 at 605 pm kerry – you should be aware that diabetes can be reversed and even cured exercise and a very low carb diet are necessary to do this but is far superior than the allopathic medical approach dr mercola at httpwwwmercolacom talks about this in depth reply richard on april 8 2017 at 1019 am mercola often has some good points but he almost as often puts out misinformation i have no idea if you are quoting him correctly but what you said in your comment is not the way to reverse diabetes drs ornish fuhrman greger and esselstyn to name a few have real proof of reversing diabetes and i suggest someone interested in the subject check them out basically the solution is to focus on whole plantbased products and it is not related to low carbs but good carbs and fats reply josh on november 15 2015 at 852 am i really enjoyed this article i was actually eating a bowl of steel cut oats and just wanted to read up about some things about them and i like them a lot… at first i didn’t but it’s also a food item that causes me to eat slower and makes me fuller nice article i appreciate a nice article thanks reply neily on november 16 2015 at 930 am thanks josh glad you enjoyed the article you might enjoy one of my latest posts about secret to weight management honoring hunger and fullness reply richard on april 8 2017 at 1023 am i also enjoyed steel cut for many months but recently moved up to oat groats… i am not going to name the company but one famous for wholesome organic grains also sells organic groat oats at a very reasonable price even online…reply jean on december 5 2015 at 946 am easiest way to cook steel cut oats is in the oven you don’t even have to measure i cook a week’s worth in a glass bread loaf pan i put about an inch of dry steel cut oats in the pan put enough water in to cover the oats by an extra inch basically double the portion of water to the portion of dry oats cook at 350 degrees for about 35 – 40 minutes i stir once it makes 7 portions at 14 per portion reply jean on december 5 2015 at 948 amsmall typo in my last sentence on cooking steel cut oats in the oven my recipe makes 7 portions at 14 cup per portion forgot to include the word cup sorryreply neily on december 13 2015 at 1026 am love this jean simplicity is a wonderful thing reply deb on february 25 2016 at 741 am wow such mean and rude responses and this article is about oatmeal no wonder donald trump is leading the republican poles has the american public lost its ability to state a contrary opinion without “gutting” the

you for your support and your kind comments there will always be haters and people who don’t agree i very much appreciate everyone who supports me i approve all of my comments before they go live – even the negative ones – because everyone is entitled to their opinions unless it is especially hateful which i cannot say i have received the thing about nutrition is everyone eats and has opinions however nutrition is a science not an opinion as i wrote here httpbitly1rp wadq again thank you for your comment reply richard on april 8 2017 at 1021 am why did you add a mean and rude response if you realize there are already too many reply ross dorothy on march 13 2016 at 915 am i picked up a can of both steel cut and regular i don’t’ detect any taste difference whatsoever what i do detect is a texture difference both are yummy with some blueberries and honey mixed in main point of this article do not forgo eating oats just because you don’t like one or the other either are better than the alternatives such as processed prepacked sugar laden oat meals and both are awesome for your heart and help to reduce cholesterol and get your metabolism going early in the day to help stoke the fires of fat burning reply neily on march 14 2016 at 909 am hi dorothy – you are right in with the point of my post thanks for your commentreply katie wallace on march 31 2016 at 708 am i like making

as well replypat on august 30 2016 at 1213 pm bravo when i told a colleague about steelcut oats he said they were great but they took to long to cook in the morning my response “who said you needed to cook them” i usually just mix them with yogurt and eat them as they are or sometimes i’ll mix them the night before and stuff the container in my lunchbag in the a m reply richard on april 8 2017 at 1027 am not sure whether it was mentioned in the article but actually not cooking oats could result in much better protection for cancer phytates are reduced some from soaking but more from cooking and after years of bashing the phytates in nuts and grains it is likely that it is a good protector against cancer another case of nature knowing best and we humans taking many years to realize it…reply vicky burton on june 11 2016 at 341 pm as a diabetic who us extremely sensitive i have found steel cut oatmeal the only oatmeal i can eat without raising my blood glucose i always pair it

problem with oats grown in america including rice corn wheat and soy beans have all been genetically modified gmos… big big health hazard… europe japan and canada do not allow gmos there is a reason research it and you will be disgusted at what our food giants are doing to us… and our government condones it… it’s called capitalism… reply neily on september 15 2016 at 801 pm hello deborah – i am pleased to clarify some misinformation perhaps you were not aware there is no genetically engineered gmo wheat commercially available were you not aware japan is strong supporter of biotech crops are you not familiar with the extensive 420 page document by the committee on genetically engineered crops past experience and future prospects authored by the board on agriculture and natural resources division on earth and life studies national academies of sciences engineering and medicine quite an impressive array of authors httpwwwnapedu23395 go ahead read it i’ll wait reply david c randall on march 2 2018 at 648 pm im glad gmo is part of the discussion research shows the suitability of gmo grains for human consumption but not the impact of glyphosate residue most gmo plants are engineered for glyphosate resistance and while residues are usually minimal it is now used on 80 of american wheat as a “dessicant” that is to kill the crop field at the same time so it will dry uniformly for simultaneous harvest this is a nonlabel use or at least used to be not sure if the usda has signed off on this it is applied shortly before harvest unlike its use for weed control european studies show major deleterious effect on the human gut biome but we can’t get such studies funded here reply richard on april 8 2017 at 1041 am if you do some searching and read labels you can find oats soy and other grains that are not gmo the eu does allow gmo products httpwwwecowatchcomeuropegmodebatenotovereuvotestoallowgmoimportsdespiteoppos1882107256html almost all of canada’s canola is gmo japan allows some gmo imports when you state that a certain country does not allow gmo it is necessary to specify imports or home grown because the ban can be for one and not the other the chemicals that are used for some gmo products bothers me so i only consume nongmo soybeans almost all of the corn commercially available in the us is gmo so to avoid that you need to avoid corn china is one of the largest producers of gmo products that alone should tell you something about the safety of consuming gmo products reply pye on june 12 2017 at 754 am beg pardon but“china is one of the largest producers of gmo products that alone should tell you something about the safety of consuming gmo products”all that tells me is that as usual china doesn’t give a toss about the health and safety of their citizens or anyone else for that matter seriously this is the country where food adulteration is so common and so potentially dangerous that many chinese nationals will only buy imported food – if they can afford it i mean seriously – melamine in the milk that’s literally poisonit isn’t that gmo foods are poison – my issues with gmo have more to do with contamination due to crosspollination with nongmo crops and the proprietary nature of gmo seed it isn’t a nutritional hazard so much as an agricultural one citing china as an example of food safety is definitely not where you want to go with this reply dirk hofman on september 23 2016 at 657 pm steel cut oats are a 42 vs a 66 on the glycemic index i would personally not call a 38 difference insignificant reply neily on september 25 2016 at 1052 am hi dirk thanks for your comment perhaps but glycemic index has so many inherent issues…check out this excellent video and its follow up httpsyoutubes53xen rkzi rarely do people eat food exclusive of any other steel cut oats alone may have a gi of 42 however most people consume them with other foods containing fat and protein which changes the gi and makes it almost meaningless furthermore just because a food is low gi doesn’t mean it’s healthy… think ice cream and chocolate…not that you shouldn’t eat these foodsreplythecandiedmango on november 3 2016 at 813 pm like a couple other commenters i was confused by the title of his post i appreciate your calm responses to some of the the more interesting comments and i’ll be reading other posts on your site reply neily on november 8 2016 at 1058 pm thanks for your supportive comment danielle – it’s most appreciated i approve all comments – the good the bad and the ugly well fortunately there haven’t been any ugly everyone is entitled to their opinion the world of nutrition is vastly confusing and this is a forum for me to help spread the word of evidencebased nutrition sorry for the confusion but right away i did state about the title “okay that title is a bit harsh and perhaps misleading let me explain”replyaustinawadedesign on december 13 2016 at 722 pm the reason why steel cut is “healthier” and contains a lower gi and gl than other forms of oats is quite simple… each piece of steel cut oat has a much lower surface area for enzymes to act upon per unit volume compared to all other forms think of it like this which takes longer to melt… a brick of ice a thin sheet of ice or a sheet of ice that is pulverized into tiny little pieces one can’t say that steel cut oats are more “nutritious” compared to rolled oats when looking at the content that is extracted from it but one could say it is “healthier” from an energy perspective reply neily on december 14 2016 at 758 am hi austin – appreciate your comment and argument i stand by my previous discussion about gigl being nearly worthless in the context of how people eat and just because a food has a lower gigl certainly doesn’t make it healthier think ice cream…nothing wrong with it i love it but lower gi does not equal health…energy yes energycalories rarely do ppl eat steel cut oats buck naked – cooked with nothing added to them generally they’ll add some sweetness fruit etc fatprotein nuts eg adding fat andor protein are going to change the gi response since they don’t impact glucose like carbs do furthermore the action of salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase digestive enzymes is negligible at best check out my colleague dr jo’s 2part video on gi httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvs53xen rkzi and httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbphwo98z4reply chris on january 3 2017 at 903 pm wow and wow i googled steel cut oats trying to find an intelligent answer as to why people are thinking they are better than regular oats theres some very diverse opinions and some great research its good you post both for and against so people can see all arguments and formulate their own opinions from the reading i have done on the subject of raw and digesting of nutrients and this is just judging on what i have learned on human digestion cooking at least light cooking and soaking can be included here too plant foods helps our bodies digest things much betterif u look at our digestive tract compared to many plant eaters like bovine animals for example they have a very long and comprehensive one some having numerous stomachswe have one stomach and relatively shorter one much like carnivoresso just that alone leads me to believe we aren’t as equipped to handle raw plants as other animals are kind of left of centre of this post but i would appreciate anyones feedback on this…reply neily on january 5 2017 at 743 pm thanks chris yes there is a very diverse opinion regarding this topic i approve posts and there has not been one yet i have not not all have been favorable obviously regarding your comment i don’t know the answer i do know there is a big difference between the human gi tract and other species the cow eg has a 4compartment stomach no comparison to ours reply athelstone on february 25 2017 at 524 am edgar cayce a famous mystic said in quite a few of his readings not to eat rolled oats he advocated steelcut also the qa session on kryoncom channelled by lee carrol who coined the term indigo children and has channelled at the united nations says to avoid the use of microwaves as they make the food unhealthy another story blood has to be heated when performing blood transfusions there was a case where someone microwaved the blood and after the transfusion the person died if a microwave does that to blood think what it does to food take it or leave it reply richard on february 26 2017 at 602 am there are many more harmful ways to cook than using a microwave dry heat administered during baking and barbecuing create ages which are very harmful you should depend more on science instead of wives tales for your diet reply pye on june 12 2017 at 820 am oh for … blood has to be warmed yes but slowly the problem with microwave blood warmers is that there is sometimes not enough control over how fast they warm the blood ending up with increased hemolysis the same thing can happen with “regular” blood warmers if they are improperly calibrated it is a problem of how fast it warms the blood not how you are warming the blood microwaving is perhaps not so great for warming blood at this point however home microwaves do to food exactly what they are supposed to do – cook it edgar cayce was a fruitcake andor a conman he had a 9th grade education incompetent to give medical advice he believed that human beings were created simultaneously as racially distinct entities bigot as well as ignorant he thought animal souls could mix with people souls and create giants loony he believed in atlantis and ancient astronauts loony he claimed to be psychic that he could tell the future and contact the dead loony if you’re going to take medical advice from someone like that and even in his time he was considered a quack let alone now no one can help you lee carol is another crackpot andor conman he also thinks he can talk to dead people ’nuff said reply athelstone on february 25 2017 at 531 am sorry to go on – steel cut oats can be easily cooked in a thermos flask in 45 minutes you can even prepare it the night before and open it in the morn ing rdy to eat how to do it put 1 part steelcut oats in a pan with 2 and a half parts of boiling water from a kettle boil it on a stove until it is bubbling vigorously pour the oats into a thermo’s using a funnel seal the thermo’s shake it lay it on its side open the next morning or in 45 minutes that’s it use a stainless sfeel thermos with a wide rim for this not a thin glass one reply athelstone on february 25 2017 at 538 am last comment – steelcut oats or any other wholegrain must never be eaten raw swallowing improperly cooked wholegrains is very dangerous they have to be cooked properly it’s very important or you will harm the body reply richard on february 26 2017 at 559 am where do you get your information many people eat oatmeal without cooking and are very healthy look into soaking them overnight and letting them ferment some without cooking and eating in the morning reply athelstone on february 27 2017 at 435 am the starch molecules in wholegrains have to be broken by heat so they become tender thereby being able to be absorbed by the intestines soaking alone won’t achieve this only cooking i know this from years of personal testing what happens is that the uncooked wholegrain remains lodged in the intestines – until eventually a colonic irrigation to get out the rotting matter will be necessary if you search google for steel cut oats long enough you’ll find accounts of people who have actually tried eating them raw to their detriment if you want to eat raw grains rye flakes are better as they have already been heat treated but they have to be chewed thoroughly – grinding them into powder in a blender with a little honey free range egg yolk and lemon juice works well but then there’s the gluten – cooked quinoa is superior or puffed quinoa which also doesn’t have to be cooked because it’s already been exposed to heat reply richard on february 27 2017 at 808 am your personal experience means nothing you are one person with who knows what wrong with your intestines try researching some valid studies instead of making comments about your personal experiences…reply pye on june 12 2017 at 836 am quinoa has 222 calories per cup with 45g of carbs 4 of which are insoluble fiber so 41g of carbs that matter oatmeal has 145 calories per cup cooked with 25g carbs 4 of which are insoluble fiber so 21g of carbs that matter i know which one i’m having for breakfast hint it does not begin with a “q”we can eat grains raw perfectly well we just don’t get as much nutrition out of them human beings started cooking for a reason – it improves availability of nutrients but that doesn’t mean raw foods including cereals are totally indigestible without it eat too much raw grain and sure you might get a tummyache – but unless its ergotified rye it is unlikely to kill you or do any real harm at all and just for the record – i only care about carbs for reasons of … diabetes otherwise the whole low carb thing is just another crazy diet fad reply pye on june 12 2017 at 131 pm i meant indigestible fiber not insoluble dang me lolreply rich on march 9 2017 at 802 am thanks for a thoughtprovoking and useful page at this time imo mainstream medical thinking is that the lower gi of steelcut oats vs rolled can be used to advantage to help prevent diabetes it isn’t as simple as picking one over the other morethorough cooking increases the gi as you point out the gl is the same regardless of how you cut or cook the oats that gl and the time one takes to eat a meal are major factors in the body’s insulin response to that meal the other foods in the meal also matter and people vary in ways not yet understood steelcut oats are just one more arrow for the quiver reply neily on march 11 2017 at 335 pm…”one more arrow for the quiver” i like that thanks for your input rich reply pye on june 12 2017 at 922 am no gl is not the same no matter how you cut or cook the oats gl is gi x the actual amount of digestible carbs in the food cooking and processing changes gi it doesn’t change the amount of carbs in the oats – it can in pasta or potatoes as some starch is “cooked out” into the water which is discarded but we don’t discard the “cooking water” when cooking oats whether rolled flaked steel cut or whole groats it is absorbed into the oatmeal net carbs remain the same only the gi changes because of this gi is highly variable even for a uniform batch of oats if you “overcook” you may increase palatability of steel cut oats or oat groats – but you also increase the gi i contend steel cut vs rolled oats isn’t significant because most of us are going to cook them longer to get a creamier less chewy and less objectionable texture – ultimately the gi won’t be that much different between “overcooked” steel cut oats and “regularly” cooked rolled oats for a “normal” breakfast amount of approx 1c cooked the difference will likely be negligible or maybe not but maybe and oats aren’t uniform variety growing conditions moisture content fertilization heck basically everything that happened while they were growing will make them highly variable from season to season and from one field to the next same is true of all foods thus gi isn’t much good for much of anything actually practical because it is so variable plus it is based entirely on the reactions of a handful of people it varies with testing methodology it varies with the way measurements are made it varies with the way items are cooked processed and what variety they are i’ve seen papers showing differences in ultimate gl depending on how they are chewed and that’s not even considering environmental issues while the farmer was growing them then there are population statistics to be considered i can guarandamntee you that inuit persons are not going to show the same gi measurements you get from europeans and if gi isn’t definitive gl cannot be definitive the idea of gigl is certainly attractive however the reality is just as homely as trying to control your blood sugar just counting carbs – more in my opinion and frankly – total carbs varies with all these factors as well just not as much heck we think of rice as a pretty uniform product – at least within a particular variety but total carbs for say basmati rice varies between 40g per cup cooked and 56g – due to variations in varieties growing conditions cooking procedures and testing methodologies gigl is even more variable than that there’s just no such thing as a standardized gigl value for any crop or food just look at the plethora of gigl tables all over the interwebs none of them are the same and ultimately none of them can be meaningful because even if we could pin down the glycemic index for a given crop or food it would change depending on how it is cooked baked roasted boiled microwaved fried deep fried for how long at what temperature constant temperature or did it vary how did it vary did you slicedicemash it did you peel andor pitseed it and let’s not forget – the gi values are based on the blood glucose reactionsprofiles of healthy individuals there is no guarantee that folks with diabetes will react in the same fashion or that there aren’t significant differences between type i and type 2 or even within the types depending on other factors such as vitaminmineral deficiencies or lack thereof etc etc etc talk about a can of worms not a system i would want to have my diebetic diet relying on replyxscifitom2013 on march 12 2017 at 118 am the 2008 international list of glycemic index of food determined by measurement of multiple subjects’ response to the food shows rolled oats to have a lower glycemic index than steel cut the two however are within the margin of error of each other diabetes care 2008 31 12  gi vs glucose porridge rolled oats 49 8 porridge steel cut oats 52  4 they are statistically within margin of error of each other as they should be from identical composition but based on the number alone you should say rolled is lower glycemichttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc2584181so far vicky’s experience above is the only data i have seen favoring steel cut i could imagine that steel cut if cooked “al dente” could be lower gi since it’s sort of “encapsulated” and might take longer to digest i didn’t cook it that way i took two hours cooking and stirring it until it was the same consistency as the rolled i don’t know how the diab care people cooked them i have a suggestion though if people also have high cholesterol i lost weight exercised got my waist below 40 inches etc got body fat  down 4 did all the stuff you’re supposed to do…and my cholesterol went up to 270 tc 190 ldl from around 250 doc wanted to put me on statins i added 10g of soluble fiber and 20g of insoluble to my diet oatmeal  allbran bran buds  blueberries beans and arranged it so i had soluble fiber with each meal in 3 weeks my tc was 200 my ldl 131 and my hdl 55 doc no longer wants to “treat” me what i noticed on that list is that allbran is quite a bit lower gi 30 than oatmeal so if you have an a1c problem and a cholesterol problem that could be a way to go worth checking out the “bran buds” allbran have added metamucil giving them 3g soluble fiber per 30g of cereal i suggest letting them soak a while in whatever fluid you’re using as they are too crunchy straight for my taste good luckreply neily on march 13 2017 at 1232 pm thanks for your comment i would bet though the cholesterol lowering had much more to do with adding the soluble fiber than anything to do with glycemic index i’m not sure if that is what you were insinuating but yes the soluble fiber in oatmeal is terrific and the reason why it can carry a health claim – that it helps with cholesterol lowering reply ronny on may 1 2017 at 1254 pm i went through a phase last year when i was eating them rolled oats straight out of the can raw oats albeit already somewhat processed when rolled these are the quickest oats around basically require zero cooking time the taste is unique and interesting and requires a bit of an effort to imagine that i am not actually eating the cardboard they came in… but overall yummy and healthy this year i am going through a 10 lb box of costco oats microwaving them without sticking my head into the appliance  and enjoying with a dollop of raisins another phase for me i suppose reply neily on may 4 2017 at 914 am hey whatever works thanks for sharingreply anna cesnjevar on august 22 2017 at 319 am the easiest way to make creamy steelcut oats bring one part oats to three parts liquid to the boil cover the pot with a lid turn off the heat and leave to sit overnight your oats will be ready in the morning these oats are closest to their original grain form they are made when the whole groat is cut into several pieces with a steel blade they often have skim milk powder emulsifiers and other preservatives added to help them develop a creamy texture when you cook them reply neily on august 24 2017 at 315 pm great suggestion anna very simple thanks for your comment neily reply susan leslie on september 2 2017 at 918 pm i bought a rice cooker for the sole purpose of cooking steel cut oats it’s so easy put measured amounts of water and oats in the rice cooker and close the lid set the automatic timer for wake up go to bed wake up to hot perfectly cooked oatmealreply neily on september 5 2017 at 728 am i’ve heard using the rice cooker…great suggestion neily reply susan leslie on september 2 2017 at 919 pm should have said ” set automatic timer for wakeup time”reply stephen on september 25 2017 at 625 am i believe the quick cooking steel cut oats have been cut into smaller pieces than the long cooking steel cut oats since they are thus smaller and cook faster i also suspect that they digest faster and would spike the blood sugar levels more than the regular steel cuts which would give to sugar more slowly the nutrition is probably the same but if you have cardio vascular disease and diabetes like me the lower the sugar spikes the better reply neily on october 1 2017 at 942 am hi stephen – thanks for your comment yes smaller pieces of oats will yield a higher glycemic index gi – what you refer to as spikes in blood sugar if you eat oats exclusive of any food yes it might make a difference however most people eat oats with some combination of protein and fat which changes the gi i recommend making oats with dairy or soy milk because of the protein which other ‘milks’ lack versus water and adding some whole fruit like berries or apple plus some nuts my preference walnuts try to get at least 20 grams of protein 2530g if possible at the breakfast meal reply edward on october 25 2017 at 708 am i eat steel cut oats with zero cook time by mixing a few spoonfuls into a container of greek yogurt i enjoy the crunchiness as i eat the oats soak up moisture and the chewing gets easier thanks for your article reply neily on october 26 2017 at 857 pm that worksreplybonnie on november 19 2017 at 501 pm i eat either reqular quaker oatmeal or steel cut i have found that either one if i put it in a container add the hot water – cover tightly and take to work by the time i get to work and am ready to eat either is ready no they are exactly the same texture as if i had cooked on stove but close enough i didn’t use steel cut until recently because i thought it had to cook on the stove for an hour i tried this method that i have been using for regular oatmeal and it works fine i don’t use quick oatmeal reply andy b on november 21 2017 at 142 am i never liked oatmeal until i tried steelcut regular rolled oats are just too sticky and gluey for me and instant are even worse i love the chewiness of the steelcut oats and the toasty flavor reply diane mc lean on february 16 2018 at 717 am thank you so much for this article i feel better about my preference for oldfashioned oatsreply david c randall on march 2 2018 at 624 pm it’s a shame we’re all arguing over details instead of the substance steel cut oats do have a lower glycemic index about 23 that of rolled and any instant grain or canned legume has been precooked fast under high heat and pressure this breaks long complex carbohydrate chains into shorter segment more quickly digested spiking blood sugar faster it goes without saying that the added ingredients in instant packages of oatmeal make them unacceptable for diabetics so why not go for the best option personally i prefer the texture and nutty flavor of steel cut to the mushyness of rolled but that’s a matter of taste in a breakfast i add cinnamon which gives an impression of greater sweetness and lowers blood sugar to boot also dried fruit and nuts almost no sugar i cook a big pot over the weekend and dole out servings during the week heat in a pan or mw your choice i also love them as a pilaf with onion garlic parsley etc no sugar of course just salt and pepper it resembles risotto look up recipes and makes a great savory side dish with dinner an aside eating rolled oats not instant almost daily brought my bad cholesterol down 25 points in 2 months the next time 2 yrs later i had discovered steel cut same portions and it was 60 points in 2 months i’ll never bother with rolled again reply david c randall on march 2 2018 at 628 pm oh and for breakfast i do always add dairy reply leave a reply
