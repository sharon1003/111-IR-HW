puppy wont eat or drink species dog breed chihuahua age 612 months my puppy has not been feeling good for the past 2 days she doesnt eat or drink anything even though i try to give it to her myself also her hind legs are week and she kind of stumbles when she walks i think she is just sad because the other dogs we had are gone and she has no one to play with can you tell me what i can do to make her feel a lot better and go back to acting normal dr marie replied the symptoms you have described have me concerned while a puppy can be a little sad because of losing a playmate they would not be this sick any time a puppy doesnt want to eat there is usually something wrong there are a number of things that can cause a puppy to not eat or drink and to stumble when walking it may be that she is fighting a virus a serious virus like parvovirus usually causes vomiting and diarrhea but sometimes early in the virus we dont see it for the first few days its also possible that there is an infection somewhere it could be because of a bite from another pup if there is an infection she will need oral antibiotics to clear it up i would highly advise a vet visit puppies dont have a lot of reserves to fight dehydration if you cant get to a vet tonight you can try offering her an electrolyte solution to help fight against dehydration to get her to eat you can also try making some soup by adding warm water to some canned puppy food however she should see the vet as soon as possible i hope she is ok dr marie this question was asked in our ask a vet for free sectioncheck out our dog age calculatorandcat age calculator want to receive pet coupons vet advice and info on new pet products in your inbox indicates required email address first name last name well only send you great stuff never spam unsubscribe any time disclaimer although dr marie is a qualified veterinarian the information found on this site is not meant to replace the advice of your own veterinarian ask avet questioncom and dr marie do not accept any responsibility for any loss damage injury death or disease which may arise from reliance on information contained on this site do not use information found on this site for diagnosing or treating your pet anything you read here is for information only search for similar questions
