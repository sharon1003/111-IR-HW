how much awake time does a 2 month old need updated on november 14 2006m b asks from keller tx on november 12 200611 answers i have a 2 month old and im never sure how much awake time she needs were on a 3 hour eat wake sleep schedule during the eating and wake portion she stays up around an hour  maybe a little more and then sleep for about 2 hours i always feel like shes not up for very longbefore its already time to put her back down for a nap she does start yawning closing her eyes for long periods of time and gets a little fussy so i know shes tired but im wondering if thats an adequate amount of awake time so basically shes up for an hour to an hour plus then sleeps 2 hours then does it again except for at nights where she sleeps longer and isnt up after eating and then what are some creative things to do during the wake time to make sure im stimulating her enough do they really sleep this much respond to question1 mom found this helpful what can i do next add your

would say youre not lucky your baby sleeps so well because youve trained her so well with your feedwakesleep cycle you are doing great i think at 8 weeks 1 hour and 15 minutes is a good amount of wake time sleeping 1 hour 45 minutes as she reaches 1012 weeks 1 12 hour wake and 1 12 sleep should be perfect then you usually move to a 3 12 hour feeding schedule and it becomes 1 hour 45 min wake and feed great job trying to keep her awake and then take a good nap ideas for wake timebouncy seat in front of a baby einstein she may not watch the whole thing but all the colors and movement will stimulate her and keep her awake massages and tickle time are always great on the changing table carry her in the bjorn facing out while doing chores around the house the gym is great i dont know what you call it its a mat with bars over it with toys hanging down a walk is great grapevine mills is perfect this time of year tummy time will wake her up  the swing may be too comfortable at this age for wake time my advise would be to keep her out of her comfortable bed until nap time even if she falls asleep put her on the floor in the living room with the lights on and voices at full volume then at nap time put her in her bed that will train her to stay awake keep up the good work1 mom found this helpful helpful yes  no share report l lanswers from dallas on november 13 2006it sounds like you are doing a great jobcause every other baby ive ever known sleeps longer in the day than wants to be up at night i had my oldest daughter on the same schedule you follow and she did great now my youngest daughter she fought it for a while but than she eventually followed it at about four months old  shes 16 months old now  so it is really good the way you are doing things im expecting my third baby in jan hopefully he will follow that schedule well keep up the good work congratulations on your new babyhelpful yes  no share report canswers from dallas on november 14 2006mi have a 2 month old myself and your child seems to be on a similar schedule as mine my pediatrician says babies need upto 18 hours of sleep at this stage so they would be awake only for about 8 hours my son usually stays awake for an hour after he feeds during the day and takes a nap between feedings though sometimes he stays awake between feedings also you seem to be doing the right things when she is awake c helpful yes  no share report l sanswers from phoenix on november 12 2006usually parents worry that their babies arent sleeping enough  yes they really do sleep a lot at this age some sleep more than others so count yourself lucky heres some information i pulled for you off of dr sears website  wwwaskdrsearscom it sounds like shes probably fine most parents can tell if their child is not getting enough sleep my four yearold son is an angel when he is well rested but when he is behind on sleep watch out here are some average times that most kids sleep1 week 165 hrs 1 month 155 hrs 3 months 15 hrs 6 months 1425 hrs 12 months 1375 hrs 2 years 13 hrs 4 years 1112 hrs 5 years 11 hrs 10 years 975 hrs adolescent 75 hrs school night adolescent 875 hrs weekendsome kids will sleep more or less than this the important thing is that your child feels and acts well rested helpful yes  no share report canswers from dallas on november 13 2006m i have two little girls almost 4 and 13 months  they both had pretty much the same schedule as your little one they were both sleeping 12 hours a night by 10 weeks plus all the napping i think until they were both  6 months they took 3 naps  2 long ones  then a short one around dinner time they both have always gone to bed between 7  730 pm my 13month old still takes 2 23 hour naps a day plus sleeps 12 hours at night dont worry the time they sleep will shorten quickly  you have all the time in the world to bound with your precious baby when mine were little i would sing play music read stories go on walks  talk to them let them play under their play mats etc sounds like you are doing a great job  your baby is very luckyc helpful yes  no share report l sanswers from dallas on november 14 2006as a newborn specialist parenting coach and infant sleep trainer i work with babies and their schedules every single day at 2 months old with an every3hours eatawakesleep routine which by the way is exactly the routine that i teach my clients to follow your baby should be awake for 1 to 1 12 hours from the time you wake her for a feeding in that 3hour cycle her naps should last from 12 hours so if youre putting her back down within 1 to 1 12 hours of waking shell get that much sleep i know it seems like all youre doing is feeding her and then putting her back to bed but its really in her best interest as far as activities go keep in mind that babies do most of their growing while theyre sleeping and that they really can easily become overstimulated so you want to always be watching for signs of overstimulation fussiness disengaging from you visually becoming more active kicking and waving arms but thats not to say that you cant have some fun with your baby here are some things you can try1 give baby tummy time every day 2 babies have very short attention spans 15 minutes so switch activities often 3 make a ‘circuit training’ for baby activity mat walk around house swing tummy time bouncy seat stroller mobile stories dancing etc 4 talk sing and coo at your baby every day 5 allow your baby to have some ‘alone time’ when he is not being entertained by you 6 try to spend some time outdoors every day even if it is chilly you can step outside with baby for a minute or two when it is nice go for a long walk or sit at the park 7 take baby on a daily tour of your home telling him what goes on in each room and talking to any pets you may have 8 give him different perspectives each play time on his back on his tummy sitting upright even with support on his side looking down at things from up above carry him on your shoulder on your hip facing out facing in lying on his side babies get bored looking at the world from the same perspective 9 go on an outing once a week go to the mall a baby gym or swimming class or just the grocery store talk to baby about what you see 10 gymboree or another parentchild class play group etc helpful yes  no share report s sanswers from dallas on november 13 2006believe me youre doing a great job babies are supposed to sleep the majority of the time at that age that is what helps them grow just being around you is quite enough stimulation and may i also addtake advantage of it now i thought the same thing and then a switch went on and mine never slept for more then 3 hours at at time until she turned 18 months old all of my friends laughed and said she didnt want to miss anything its funny now but not at the time im here to tell you that have minds of their own which is a great thing good luckhelpful yes  no share report m fanswers from dallas on november 13 2006sounds like youre doing a great job yep about an hour of awake time is all she needs right now your voice and hugs are the only real stimulation she needs you dont want to overstimulate her because then youll lose all that great sleephelpful yes  no share report aanswers from dallas on november 13 20062 month olds need 16 to 18 hours of sleep per day shell start to stay awake longer around 4 months probably sounds like youve got a great baby enjoy ithelpful yes  no share report c canswers from dallas on november 13 2006my baby hardly slept during the day and when he did took 3045 min naps for me it was nearly brutal we were clueless in the sleep dept and eventually heard about a great book called healthy sleep habits happy child by marc weisbluth its a great book a little on the thick side but so worth the investment i suggest reading it studying it and rereading it good news is that it covers sleep all the way through teen years so you dont have to read it all napping got better for us but only after we fixed nighttime sleeping issues that happened around 56 months not to brag but as encouragement i tell you my son is 16 mos now and sleeps 1213 hrs a night  going down at 630 he naps anywhere from 24 hrs a day really try the book its great good luckhelpful yes  no share report v banswers from houston on november 14 2006youre doing awesome babies some of them really do sleep that much i was lucky like you and have a good sleeper shes 10 months now and sleeps 11 hours at night and takes 2 naps for a total of about 3 hours during the day when she was little it seemed like she slept all of the time too she started sleeping 8 hours per night at 5 weeks old and 10 hours per night by 8 weeks old but the schedule your little one is on is perfect for her age as for the stimulationeverything at that age is stimulating you can read to her colorful board books are fun play on the floor with her just get some rattles or a little gym with the stuff hanging over it mirrors are fun too although she may not react too much to it yet we used the baby einsteins sparingly but she did seem to like them she never made it through the whole thing at that age but she did like it for a little while i would avoid the swing if youre trying to keep her awake playing on the floor with them is best and try to do tummy time my little one hated it but we still tried to do it a little bit every day enjoy the sleep while it lasts pretty soon she is going to be very active and while its a ton of fun its also a ton of work  congratulationshelpful yes  no share report
