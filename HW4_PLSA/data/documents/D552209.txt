acclimatization acclimation is the adaption from days to weeks short term acclimatization is the adaption from months to years long periods of time what does it mean to be homeothermic internal body temp is physiologically regulated to keep near constant even when the environment temps change by how many degrees do we normally fluctuate in temperature no more than about 18 degress f 10c normal range 97100 degress fwhat percentage of the energy utilized by the body is used for physiological processes 25 is used at energy atp rest is used for heat how does heat move in the body and by what means must move from deep the core to skin shell where it has access to outside environment heat is moved by blood what are the 4 ways of temperature transfer describe and give examples for each conduction touching hot or cold object transfer of heat from one solid material to another thru direct molecular contact ex sitting on cold metal bench heat loss  conviction moving heat from one place to another by motion of gas or liquid across heated surface ex air conditioning radiation transfer of heat thru infrared rays primary method for discharging resting bodys excess heat sun is the primary source light colored clothing helps with dissipate heat to environment evaporation primary heat loss during exercise once fluid is evaporates heat is lost ex sweating during soccer allows heat loss to help maintain core temp must evaporate to experience heat loss what can increase the effectiveness of convection the greater the rate of movement greater heat exchange what is the main method of heat loss during exercise evaporationsweating what is a major source of insulation for the body clothing look upwhat type of clothing can enhance heat loss light colored and thin clothing how much heat loss can evaporation account for during exercise 80 of heat loss at exercise 1020 at rest how much heat is lost with 1 l of sweat 2428 kj what must occur for sweat to cause heat loss evaporation how does humidity effect thermoregulation humidity water vapor high humidity 100 sat no more room for water to be evap which limits sweat to be evap and heat loss low humidity room for water to evap sweat can be evap which can allow proper heat loss what is considered the regulator of temperature within the body poahpreoptic anterior hypothalamus bodys thermostat hypothalamus what is the set point temperature 986 f 37cwhen sensing heat change what is considered the early warning sensor for the body peripheral receptorsin skin serve as warning system where are the most sensitive temperature sensors located hypothalamus brain regions and spinal cord aka central receptors understand the process the body takes to thermo regulate both hot and cold temperatures fig 115what are the four main ways the poah regulates temperature skin arterioles poah signals sns to dilate or constrict eccrine sweat glands poah signals sns which allows secretion of sweat to surface skeletal muscles stimulate shivering endocrine glands hormones allows increase in metabolic rates cooling releases thyroxine which can increase metabolic rate more than 100 also catecholoamines epinephrine and nonepinephrine enhances activity of sns what are the two tasks that are often in conflict with the cardiovascular system circulating system has to transport blood to working muscles and skin 1 increase q hr and contractility 2 shuntingof blood from inactive tissue shunts from the kidneys stomach and liver poah dilation of skin arterioles understand the cardiovascular response to exercise in a hot environment as thermo center instructs cardio system to direct more blood flow to the skin superficial blood vessels dilate to bring more warm blood to surface upward drift in hr compensates for decrease in stroke volume aka cardio drift how do methods other than evaporation affect thermoregulation in the heat  what is the difference between eccrine and apocrine sweat glands eccrine more common throughout body increase s of them on palms of hands and soles of feet have coiled and tubular shape and discharge onto skin surface more clear and odorless contains mostly water and salt apocrine less common found in armpits groin and around nipples sticky and smelly since it contains organics controlled by hormone and only turned on after puberty what controls sweating sympathetic nervous system snswhat critical electrolyte is absorbed in the uncoiled portion of the sweat gland sodium main then chloride understand how sweat loss affects performance and heat illness an increase in sweat loss means a decrease in plasma which increases heart rate but decrease q since sv decreases this affects performace and can cause dehydration since 2532 loss of sweat per hour how do hormones influence fluid balance release of aldosterone and adh increase causing sodium and water retention which expands plasma volume what are the six factors that determine heat stress air velocity air temp clothing humidity metabolic heat production radiant heat sources understand the signs and symptoms related to the three heat illnesses heat cramps painful large muscle cramps lockup sweating thirst and fatigue heat exhaustion fatigue nausea vomiting sweating fainting dizziness headache and goosebumps heat stroke censsation of sweating confusion unconscious what are some methods that can be used to prevent hyperthermia clothing early morning sessions readily drink fluids judge fluid loss weight before and after practicecompetitionhow do we acclimate to a heated environment and what adaptations does the body make 912 days of training expands plasma volume which helps q hr decrease sweat increase and distribution earlier sweat and sodium conservation what two elements cause excessive heat loss air and water how is excessive heat loss regulated peripheral vasoconstriction sns stimulate smooth muscle to contract constricts blood flow to shell of body nonshivering stimulation of metabolism by sns increase shivering cycle of contraction and relaxation what is cold habituation exposure to cold without significant heat loss lower core temp what role does convection conduction and radiation play with heat loss they all dissipate heat independent on thermal gradient what are the main factors that influence a persons ability to lose heat to the environment body insulation subcutaneous fat and inactive peripheral muscles body size surface area to mass ratio women vs men what causes the greatest loss of heat in the water convection body loses heat 4 times faster in water than it does in air at same temp what can increase heat loss in water heat loss is accelerated if cold water is moving around individual are freezing temperatures required for cold related complications no 15c 59f decrease rectal temp by 21c 38f per hour what is the dangerous loop that occurs leading to performance loss and health complications relating to cold exposure muscles contract with a decrease force as fatigue sets in metabolic heat decreases what source of fuel is used for aerobic exercise and how is it limited in a cold environment fat vasoconstriction decrease blood flow to area from which a ffa would be moblized then ffa dont increase as much levels of catecholamines how is metabolism affected by drops in temperature for each 18f decrease in cellular temp metabolism decreases by half at what temperature does skin freezing occur about 20fwhat are methods to treat hypothermia warmup slowly to avoid shock warm beverage remove from cold dry clothing and blankets
