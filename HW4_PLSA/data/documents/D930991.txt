nuts are a better source of protein than powders istockphotoby casey seidenberg september 23 2015this summer my 12yearold played four or more hours of baseball including fitness training every day during this stretch he developed a new interest in building muscle and spent a lot of time admiring his developing sixpack abs he argued that he needed extra protein to fuel his workouts and build his muscles and proposed buying protein powders like the ones advertised on espn i agreed with him that his body required more nutrients during this period of intensified training than it would on a lazy summer day but i disagreed that the solution was a chemical protein powder how much protein do kids really need the institute of medicine recommends a daily allowance of•34 grams for 13yearold children•46 grams for girls ages 14 to 18•52 grams for boys ages 14 to 18000copy30 mouthwatering recipes approved by health experts view photos dietitian ellie krieger nourish schools cofounder casey seidenberg and certified health education specialist elaine gordon offer picks for meals from breakfast to dessert some protein powders provide 80 grams of protein per serving this is considerably more than a growing child needs in one day let alone in one serving imagine what that child might eat in one day an ideal breakfast might be a cup of whole yogurt with fruit and granola 10 grams of protein lunch could be a cup of bean chili with a sliced avocado 18 grams of protein followed by dinner of three ounces of chicken one cup of brown rice and a serving of green beans 30 grams of protein that child just consumed 58 grams of wholefood protein so he surely doesn’t need to supplement his diet with a processed powder yet what if — like my son — your child wants to build extra muscle barbara lewin a dietitian and sports nutritionist who has worked with professional and olympic athletes explains “to add one pound of muscle the body needs a additional 10 grams to 14 grams of protein per day ” that’s what comes in one cup of plain whole yogurt or 2 fried eggs if your child is already eating three balanced meals and perhaps a nutritious snack he might already be getting those extra grams protein powders therefore seem unwarranted especially when too much protein can have the undesirable affect of stressing the kidneys and liver and possibly interfering in the body’s ability to absorb calcium to boot excess protein is often converted into fat instead of transforming into muscle mass one study has also shown that as protein intake increases so does a body’s need for water so if your children are increasing their daily protein be sure they drink more water varieties of protein powders protein powders can be made from different ingredients the most common are whey casein soy pea rice and hemp each variety carries its own pros and cons for instance whey is a complete protein that is easily digested and absorbed into the bloodstream whey protein concentrate is preferable to whey protein isolate yet whey and casein proteins are both derived from dairy so people who are lactose intolerant may have a difficult time digesting them soy is a potential allergen and a majority of the soy in the united states has been genetically modified which can be a health concern pea rice and hemp are not complete proteins so are best used to supplement other sources of wholefood protein instead of as a meal replacement the downside of protein powders nothing is wrong with supplementing a balanced diet with the occasional smoothie that includes a scoop of protein powder the danger arises when someone especially a growing youth uses these powders instead of eating enough whole foods additional risks emerge when a teen consumes large volumes of these processed powders many are loaded with sugar and unhealthful ingredients such as artificial flavorings artificial sweeteners untested herbs antibiotics and heavy metals many are not even regulated by the fda both consumer reports and consumer labcom have conducted independent tests uncovering that many brands contain toxic chemicals and other undisclosed ingredients while other brands were found guilty of exaggerating the amount of nutrients they supply choosing a protein powder when buying a protein powder look for these characteristics• few ingredients and additives the ideal protein powder would include just the main protein source and nothing else in other words a whey protein powder would include whey protein concentrate as the sole ingredient and a pea protein powder would list peas as the only ingredient also don’t fall for sales gimmicks that advertise extra vitamins super foods or probiotics in a powder chances are the small amounts of these added benefits render them ineffective• free of sugar and artificial sweeteners• low in heavy metals and toxins small amounts of heavy metals are inevitable in our food supply but consuming a product that contains heavy metals on a daily basis or in some cases many times a day can be damaging• organic and nongmo• a gmp  good manufacturing practices label verifying that the product was manufactured in a facility following best industry standards and therefore discloses all ingredients beware of the lure of “energy” as powders advertised as such might include caffeinecontaining ingredients coffee cocoa guarana and mate that stimulate yet don’t actually provide longlasting energy and be wary of the promise of natural flavors the fda allows something to be labeled “natural” if the original source is a natural product even though undisclosed items may be added to that natural product during processing for instance in order to remove oils from the soy hemp rice or peas so they don’t turn rancid on the shelves the grains and beans are often treated using chemicals that may remain on the food a better idea i’ve seen the advertisements that portray big muscles and protein powders as awfully appealing and i see why my boys fall prey to them yet there are healthier alternatives to help kids get the nutrients they need while healthfully building muscle a smoothie packed with one of the following whole food proteins offers vitamins minerals and healthful fats and quite possibly puts any chemicallypowdered shake to shame•nut or seed butters• raw seeds or nuts•ground flaxseeds chia seeds or hemp seeds•whole yogurt•coconut milk 5 grams of protein per cup•raw oats soaked overnight in water then drained 6 grams of protein per cup•raw cacao nibs 4 grams of protein per 1 ounce serving plus antioxidants vitamins and minerals•dark leafy greens such as spinach 5 grams of protein per cup plus vitamins minerals and chlorophyll•an avocado 4 grams of protein plus healthful fatsseidenberg is cofounder of nourish schools
