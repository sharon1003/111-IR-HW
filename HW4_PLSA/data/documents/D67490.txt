more useful to the recipient the first step is to fix and size the columns the columns are aliased to c1c2 and c3 then use the column command to format each column the two dashes in the first line define a comment and are ignored by sqlplus authsqlcolumn c1 heading first name format a15 column c2 heading lastname format a30 column c3 heading city format a20 select authorfirstname c1 authorlastname c2 authorcity c3 from authorthe aliased column names will be returned by the database using the c1 c2 c3 names the column command is used to configure the output the heading simply names the column much the same as an alias would the first sqlplus column format command iscolumn c1 heading first name format a15based on the alias column c1 is authorfirstname from the author table the column heading first name is enclosed in double quotes because it has a space in it the column format value allows 15 characters to accommodate the authors first name in the results likewise based on the alias column c2 is authorlastname 30 characters are allowed for this column and the column heading includes a vertical bar which tells sqlplus to stack the heading in the results the result of setting the column width smaller that the text returned is that the text is wrapped within that column the following are the results of running the script sql authsql last first name name city   mark

diego smith tweedle10 rows selected the column format command was used above to determine the width of the columns but what if a number is returned rather than text the size of a number is defined using the number nine and zero the number nine says if there is a digit in that location then print it if not then print nothing the number zero says that if there is a digit in that location then print it otherwise print a zero the following are examples of column format with numbers format 9999 2345 prints 2345 2345432 prints 2345 23456 prints  too large format 999900 2345 prints 234500 2345432 prints 234543if the number exceeds the size of the format the result will be pound signs since sqlplus cannot return the full number it gives you nothing some of the information and examples
