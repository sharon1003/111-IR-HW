introduction to management information system• the mis is defined as a system which provides information support for decision making in the organization• the mis is defined as an integrated system of man and machine for providing the information to support the operations the management and the decision making function in the organization• the mis is defined as a system based on the database of the organization evolved for the purpose of providing information to the people in the organization• the mis is defined as a computer based information system3 what is manpower allocation • manpower allocation is an important process that 1 enables organizations to determine the most efficient manpower composition and 2 provides a foundation to recruit andor reorganize the manpower to achieve organizational goals an effective manpower plan has the right number of workers with the right skills for the right tasks at the right time• allocate manpower resources based on command priorities historical utilization data and analysis of missiongoals and functions• manpower allocation is a plan for using available resources especially in the near term to achieve goals for the future it is the process of allocating manpower among the various projects or business units• allocation of power in terms of the workers available to a particular group or required for a particular task4 manpower allocation• manpower allocation helps in managing the impact of deficits and excess in manpower supply through promotion transfer and jobrotation• manpower retention means taking necessary steps to ensure that the organization provides a conductiveatmosphere to the employees to perform and keep each employee engaged• manpower allocation is a step in manpower planning process5 types of manpower allocation• centralized manpower allocation  centralized manpower allocation in this technique a centralized allocator keeps track of all the available resources all entities send messages requesting resources and the allocator responds with the allocated resources• hierarchical manpower allocation  hierarchical manpower allocation in this technique the resource allocation is done in multiple steps• bidirectional manpower allocation  bidirectional manpower allocation this scheme allows two independent allocators to allocate the same set of resources6 steps in manpower allocation• analyzing the current manpower inventory before a manager makes forecast of future manpower the current manpower status has to be analyzed for this the following things have to be noted • type of organization • number of departments • number and quantity of such departments • employees in these work units once these factors are registered by a manager he goes for the future forecasting• making future manpower forecasts once the factors affecting the future manpower forecasts are known planning can be done for the future manpower requirements in several work units the manpower forecasting techniques commonly employed by the organizations are as follows • expert forecasts this includes informal decisions formal expert surveys and delphi technique • trend analysis manpower needs can be projected through extrapolation projecting past trends indexation using base year as basis and statistical analysis central tendency measure • work load analysis it is dependent upon the nature of work load in a department in a branch or in a division • work force analysis whenever production and time period has to be analysed due allowances have to be made for getting net manpower requirements7 architectural design of mis for manpower allocation8 detailed design of mis for manpower allocation graphical user interface• the graphical user interface represents the user’s view of the database it is the front end to the user which is used for submission of queries to the database security• this describes the security measures for the database which include access and use of the database at the system level by use of username and password and data security by assigning user rights database• the database represents related data which is stored logically it comprises entities attributes and relationships data stored can be retrieved updated edited or deleted9 conceptual level• the conceptual model was designed independent of the physical features of the database such as dbms software and programming language the context diagram was used to show the general function of the entire system in relation to external entities10 relationship diagram for the designed mis manpower allocation• the relationship diagram shows the relationships between the different entities in the system• the entities were identified using information documented in the users specification and are employee qualification  skill job entity relationships can be one to one one to many and many to11 data flow for designed mis for manpower allocation• the data flow diagram is a representation of entities processes  data flow and data storage in the system it shows activities which transform data within the system and how data flows into out of and within the system12 use of mis in manpower allocation• the management of human resources and human capitals• this component maintains a employee database containing information about employees contact information salary details attendance performance evaluation and promotion details• this component helps the management to make use of the employees best talent13 advantages of mis in manpower allocation• it save time and money• it connects all decision centers in the organization• it increased the data processing and storage capabilities• another advantage of mis is that it minimizes information overload• it reduce fragmentation and duplication of data14 case study nursing manpower allocation in hospitals15 case study on nursing manpower allocation in hospitalsobjectives of study• develop a nursing manpower allocation model which deals with workload assignment and best fit between patient’s demands and nurses availability  in clinical wards• establish a quantitative method that relates to productivity issues and to quality of care  for nursing activities16 method• redefine nursing activities to allocate productive ways to deal with dynamics of patients variability• define nursing skills suitable for proper handling at different nursing levels for various patient’s needs• determine work load and nursing activities in a quantitative way – on basis of performance measurement• exercise findings and study approach in 2 internal med wards and 1 surgery ward in sheba med center• use simulation procedures to forecast best nurse and patient mixture– create a decision tool for management17 method
