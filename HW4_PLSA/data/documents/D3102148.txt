sarcoidosis daniel a culver dopublished august 2010contents definition and causes sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder characterized by nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation with varying degrees of concomitant fibrosis it predominantly affects the lungs eyes and skin a transmissible cause has long been suspected based on epidemiologic studies transmission via organ transplantation and experimental data 1 2 however the causative agent s remain s unknown at present  box 1  box 1 suspected causes of sarcoidosis infectious noninfectious mycobacteria dusts tuberculous clay nontuberculous  pine cellwall deficient lforms  pollen bacteria talc corynebacterium spp mixed propionibacterium acnes  metals tropheryma whippleii aluminum others beryllium †fungi zirconium cryptococcus spp endemic fungi viruses cytomegalovirus epsteinbarr virus herpes simplex virus others these organisms have been the focus of most recent studies but no single agent is confirmed it is very possible that several disparate agents induce similar reactions leading to sarcoidosis† beryllium causes a histologically identical pulmonary reaction but berylliosis can be differentiated from sarcoidosis by exposure history and lymphocyte proliferation testing note many of these are no longer considered relevant suspects as triggers for sarcoidosis back to top prevalence and risk factors epidemiologic characterization of sarcoidosis is problematic due to variability in case definitions ascertainment bias and lack of precise diagnostic methods populationbased chest xray screening programs in scandinavia and the united kingdom have suggested that there are a sizeable number of asymptomatic patients whose disease never becomes overt 3 4figure 1 click to enlarge figure 2 click to enlarge figure 3 click to enlarge demographic factors including race ethnicity age and gender markedly influence incidence in the united states the incidence in african americans is 38fold higher than in whites conferring an overall lifetime risk of 24 versus 085 5 most patients present between the ages of 20 and 40 years although a number of studies have suggested a second peak after 50 years especially in women 6 7familial clustering of sarcoidosis was first recognized 80 years ago in a casecontrol etiologic study of sarcoidosis access a recently completed descriptive u s study the familial relative risk of sarcoidosis was estimated using 736 patients who were matched for age gender and geographic location with 10862 firstdegree and 17047 seconddegree relatives 8 the relative risk for development of disease in a first or seconddegree relative was 47 after adjustments for age gender relative class and shared environment disease presentation and natural history are also influenced by epidemiologic factors white patients tend to present more often without symptoms whereas severe multisystem disease occurs more often in blacks 9 10 black race has been described as conferring added mortality however data from populationbased settings have suggested that at least part of the differential outcome may be related more to access to medical care than to inherent differences in disease behavior 1113 the access study systematically characterized 736 newly diagnosed patients at ten u s centers 14 organ involvement was significantly influenced by demographic variables including age sex and race  figure 1  15back to top pathophysiology and natural history sarcoid inflammation is characterized by nonnecrotizing granulomas  figure 2 and figure 3  the granuloma is a compact mass of cells that walls off foreign antigens typically microbes epithelioid histiocytes together with a few multinucleated giant cells compose the core surrounded by an outer rim of t lymphocytes the lymphocyte population is oligoclonal with restricted t cell receptor repertoires consistent with an antigendriven process inflammation in sarcoidosis is dependent on persistent stimulation by cd4  t cells 16 thus polymorphisms of the major histocompatibility complex and the t cell receptor that modulate affinity for the antigen may be responsible for development or course of the disease 17 granulomatous inflammation that is widespread or at critical locations eg av node can lead to functional organ impairment however it is not uncommon for organ involvement to be clinically silent the search for a causative agent has spanned more than a century it is still unknown whether a single agent triggers the disease or if sarcoidosis represents a stereotyped immune response to diverse etiologies a large number of infectious and noninfectious agents have been proposed see box 1  recent attention has focused most prominently on mycobacteria spp 18 19 and propionibacterium acnes 20 but the evidence to date has been inconclusive and sometimes contradictory the natural history of disease is variable spontaneous resolution occurs within 5 years in approximately two thirds of patients 10 over a 2year followup period in access 80 demonstrated either improvement or stability with no requirement for treatment 15 features believed to predict poor prognosis vary among studies  box 2  of all the putative risk factors no study to date has comprehensively ascertained which are independently associated with disease chronicity or progression box 2

staging of pulmonary disease based on the chest xray  figure 4 allows a general prediction of outcome for chronic sarcoidosis there is a striking degree of heterogeneity between patients some have persistent inflammation and others shift to a fibrotic phenotype this shift is not seen in all patients and the onset and pace of the fibrosis are likewise highly variable largescale epidemiologic surveys have suggested that between 54 and 10 of cases are fibrotic at presentation alone in the united states pulmonary fibrosis is the leading cause of death in sarcoidosis which carries a mortality rate of 1 to 5 other complications of pulmonary sarcoidosis include mycetomas pleural effusions bronchiectasis pulmonary hypertension endobronchial stenosis and rarely bullous lung disease depression chronic pain syndromes resembling fibromyalgia and sleep apnea are prevalent in sarcoidosis patients back to top signs and symptoms sarcoidosis can affect any organ although the lungs are involved in up to 95 of patients  figure 5  other organ systems commonly affected include the skin eyes and lymphoreticular system estimates of organ involvement are confounded by the method of discovery referral bias and the sensitivity of diagnostic modalities why different organs are differentially affected in various patients is unclear manifesting symptoms are organ dependent but the most common ones include fatigue arthralgias diffuse pain syndromes cough dyspnea wheezing chest discomfort rash photophobia scleritis decreased visual acuity weight loss and fever in the lungs important differential diagnostic possibilities include granulomatous infections idiopathic interstitial pneumonias hypersensitivity pneumonitis and asthma cutaneous manifestations are protean 21 ultimately one quarter of patients develop at least one dermatologic feature erythema nodosum is associated with acute onset of disease and confers a good prognosis lupus pernio is a chronic plaquelike induration of the face usually appearing with violaceous discoloration of the cheeks lips nose and ears  figure 6  it can erode into cartilage or bone causing permanent disfigurement lupus pernio generally portends chronic multisystem sarcoidosis is more common in older africanamerican and west indian women and is notoriously difficult to treat other skin lesions include plaques maculopapular eruptions hypo or hyperpigmented patches subcutaneous nodules and alopecia  figure 7  any ocular structure can be affected in acute disease anterior uveitis iritis causes photophobia conjunctivitis tearing pain and blurred vision  figure 8  it is usually easily treated with topical therapy chronic inflammation is typically more insidious and can affect the anterior and posterior structures retinal involvement with characteristic candlewax dripping exudates  figure 9  multifocal choroiditis  figure 10  macular edema and neovascularization may be asymptomatic but always requires treatment other commonly affected organs include the liver and spleen with elevated liver enzymes or radiologic organomegaly in approximately 50 of patients 22 23 however these rarely cause symptoms or functional impairment uncommon manifestations include neurologic cardiac bone marrow renal exocrine gland sinonasal and bone disease clinically relevant presence of these uncommon manifestations is often associated with chronic or progressive sarcoidosis when they are discovered as incidental findings on imaging studies or biopsies they do not usually portend significant organ dysfunction back to top diagnosis sarcoidosis is a diagnosis of exclusion in an appropriate clinical setting the presence of nonnecrotizing granulomas without evidence for infection is the usual criterion to suggest the diagnosis sarcoidosis mimics and nonspecific granulomatous reactions should be excluded by a careful examination and by medical occupational and medication histories box 3 lists pulmonary diseases that are often confused with sarcoidosis in practice the disease is most often diagnosed by biopsy of accessible tissues usually skin lungs or peripheral lymph nodes we recommend a histologic diagnosis before commencing any treatment in the presence of any atypical clinical features or when there is suspicion that an alternative diagnosis eg lymphoma could be present when sarcoidosis is suspected in extrapulmonary organs chest imaging or random transbronchial biopsy may be useful to help confirm the diagnosis 24bronchoscopy is a reliable minimally invasive technique to diagnose the disease combination of transbronchial biopsy with endobronchial mucosal biopsy or transbronchial needle aspiration of enlarged lymph nodes increases the sensitivity of the technique to as much as 91 endobronchial ultrasonography has been used more recently to further improve diagnostic yield samples should be analyzed for infectious agents by appropriate stains including stains for mycobacteria and fungus as well as by culture the scadding scale a descriptive schema that allows a loose characterization of the chance for disease remission is used widely to describe chest xray findings 25 use of the scale entails several caveats the stages of the scadding scale do not represent sequential or temporal disease states the predictive ability of the scale allows an approximation of outcome only there are no data correlating stages of the scale with treatment response the scale was developed more than 50 years ago from only 136 british patients and the usefulness of the scale has not been validated in comparison with chest computed tomography ct the most common radiologic findings include bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral nodular or reticulonodular infiltrates features that should prompt consideration of an alternative diagnosis include pleural effusion unilateral abnormalities and the presence of calcification in the lymph nodes chest ct usually shows typical micronodular infiltrates distributed in a bronchovascular pattern and often predominating in the mid to upper lung zones other diagnostic testing may be appropriate as guided by the initial symptoms and examination findings routine testing for elevated liver enzymes hypercalcemia renal dysfunction ophthalmologic involvement and electrocardiogram ecg abnormalities is standard at baseline other common tests to assess for organ involvement demonstrate various sensitivity and specificity depending on the population studied magnetic resonance imaging mri with gadolinium or gallium is useful for diagnosing neurologic involvement but nonspecific 26 however leptomeningeal enhancement after gadolinium has been shown to predict reversibility of sarcoid lesions 27 lumbar puncture should be performed in the appropriate clinical context to exclude mycobacterial or fungal infections csf analysis might reveal lymphocytosis elevated protein oligoclonal bands and elevated angiotensin converting enzyme levels 28thallium or sestamibi scintigraphy is useful to identify areas of active or inactive myocardial involvement 29 it is more sensitive than gallium scan in the presence of unremarkable coronary angiograms abnormal thallium scans in patients with known sarcoidosis are highly suggestive of myocardial involvement 30 however asymptomatic patients with abnormal thallium scans are unlikely to have clinically bothersome longterm disease 31 newer imaging techniques such as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography fdgpet and gadoliniumenhanced mri are promising modalities for diagnosis and for monitoring treatment response box 3 pulmonary mimics of sarcoidosis granulomatous diseases infections fungal mycobacterial otherschronic beryllium disease hypersensitivity pneumonitis other exposures methotrexate metalsrheumatologic syndromes wegener’s granulomatosis churgstrauss syndromelymphoma tumorassociated granulomas other parenchymal lung diseases eg pulmonary fibrosisasthma ecg holter monitoring and event monitoring can identify patients with dysrhythmias and a baseline ecg is recommended for all patients with newly diagnosed sarcoidosis endomyocardial biopsy is rarely useful due to poor sensitivity 32 therefore a nondiagnostic biopsy should not preclude treatment when clinical suspicion is high the initial evaluation should include an assessment accounting for the common manifestations other assays of disease activity have been the subject of intense investigation including serum angiotensinconverting enzyme level gallium67 scan bronchoalveolar lavage fluid characteristics cd4cd8 ratio total lymphocyte count and numerous other biomarkers unfortunately none has consistently predicted disease course in multiple populations recent data have demonstrated that the presence of certain human leukocyte antigen hla haplotypes eg hladr17 and hladqb1 confer good prognosis in certain european populations 33 however the usefulness of hla typing in other populations has not been confirmed for now chest xray stage demographic features clinical involvement and serial pulmonary function testing remain the best indicators in assessing prognosis and therapeutic decisions back to top treatment several situations warrant aggressive systemic treatment the most commonly accepted indications include active neurologic or cardiac involvement of any degree except bell’s palsy severe hypercalcemia ocular disease refractory to topical therapy lupus pernio significant hepatic involvement symptomatic splenic disease and bulky lymphadenopathy resulting in symptomatic compression of surrounding structures other scenarios that require casebycase decisions include sarcoid myositis sinonasal gastrointestinal exocrine gland or skin involvement granulomatous nephritis and bone disease constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and achiness are clinically bothersome for a large percentage of patients they are best approached with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications and careful assessment for the presence of depression reserving the toxicities of steroids for patients with potentially lifethreatening progressing disease neuropathic symptoms often manifesting as paresthesias or pain syndromes may be due to smallfiber neuropathy that can be present in some patients several principles guide treatment strategy corticosteroids prevent granuloma formation in most patients and they reverse immunologic derangements granuloma formation proceeds at varying rates between patients necessitating individualized treatment strategies a threshold dose of medication is usually required for effectiveness different tissues respond differently to various medications 16 for example antimalarial medications are effective for hypercalcemia and skin disease but have little effect on pulmonary disease decisions to treat pulmonary sarcoidosis should be framed in the context of the lack of evidence that treatment significantly changes the natural history of the disease the likelihood of spontaneous remission degree of physiologic impairment magnitude of symptoms and chronicity of disease must be considered for patients with acute 2 years disease systemic treatment is generally withheld unless there are significant symptoms moderate to severe physiologic impairment or rapid progression and chest imaging suggesting the presence of reversible disease eg infiltrates that are not wholly fibrosis for patients with chronic disease 2 years the chances of spontaneous remission are low the general goal of therapy in this group is to define the lowest dose of medication needed to maintain stability significant pulmonary symptoms might also be due to pulmonary vascular involvement a diagnosis that should be considered in patients whose symptoms are disproportionate to the degree of parenchymal involvement corticosteroids are the current firstline agents for treatment because clinical experience is greatest with them they generally have acceptable and reversible sideeffect profiles and the time to onset of effect is quicker than for most alternatives for pulmonary disease initial doses of 20 to 30 mgday of prednisone are probably sufficient although some clinicians have advocated higher doses 1 mgkg per day the ratio between benefit and toxicity of such doses is usually unfavorable improvements in symptoms chest radiographs and lung function tests are typical failure to respond within 2 to 3 months suggests the presence of steroidrefractory disease although some clinicians have advocated everyotherday dosing regimens this approach might not be sufficient to control active granuloma formation in general i suggest that systemic treatment of pulmonary disease should entail at least weeks to months of therapy inhaled corticosteroids may be useful for symptoms of bronchospasm and cough in conjunction with bronchodilators numerous trials have assessed their usefulness in treating parenchymal disease with the net result suggesting that they have very modest to no benefits however for patients with mild disease a trial of inhaled corticosteroids is generally well tolerated and may be helpful steroidsparing agents are used when steroids are ineffective or cause unacceptable side effects methotrexate a folic acid analogue with antiinflammatory and antiproliferative properties is generally used as a secondline agent but it has not been subjected to rigorous controlled studies in small trials it has been effective for controlling disease and reducing corticosteroid dose for acute and chronic disease 34 35 doses of 10 to 20 mg per week are typically used and treatment response can require 3 to 6 months of therapy the purine analogue azathioprine is also effective as a steroidsparing agent but its use is limited due to its potential for substantial toxicity 36 one series suggested that leflunomide might be useful in conjunction with methotrexate 37 for severe or refractory disease agents with greater potential for toxicity may be necessary including cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil antimalarial agents are often efficacious for treating dermatologic disease sinonasal sarcoid osseous disease and hypercalcemia newer approaches include antagonists of tumor necrosis factor α tnfα including thalidomide and monoclonal antibodies such as infliximab or adalimumab 38 39 the largest randomized controlled doubleblind study of therapy in sarcoidosis included 138 patients with pulmonary disease of more than 1 year’s duration 40 use of infliximab resulted in a modest net gain of 25 from baseline in fvc at 24 weeks compared with no change for placebo the clinical importance of this finding is questionable however it is evident that a portion of patients treated with this medication experience substantial benefits after failing other medical approaches a major challenge for treatment decisionmaking in sarcoidosis is the lack of headtohead studies between agents for now toxicity profile clinician comfort and experience are likely to be important factors guiding therapeutic choices as additional biologic agents become available for use in other diseases their application to sarcoidosis will be best elucidated by development of controlled trials due to the heterogeneity of the disease designing these trials will be challenging back to top summary sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology which most often affects the lungs skin and eyes in the united states sarcoidosis is more prevalent and more severe in blacks than in whites the prevalence has been estimated at 35100000 in blacks and 11100000 in whites approximately two thirds of patients experience
