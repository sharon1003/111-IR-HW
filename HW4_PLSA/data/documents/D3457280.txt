more capsaicin it contains the hottest varieties include habanero and scotch bonnet peppers jalapenos are next in their heat and capsaicin content followed by the milder varieties including spanish pimentos and anaheim and hungarian cherry peppers capsaicin is being studied as an effective treatment for sensory nerve fiber disorders including pain associated with arthritis psoriasis and diabetic neuropathy when animals injected with a substance that causes inflammatory arthritis were fed a diet that contained capsaicin they had delayed onset of arthritis and also significantly reduced paw inflammation natural pain relief topical capsaicin is now a recognized treatment option for osteoarthritis pain several review studies of pain management for diabetic neuropathy have listed the benefits of topical capsaicin to alleviate disabling pain associated with this condition in a doubleblind placebo controlled trial nearly 200 patients with psoriasis were given topical preparations

development of atherosclerosis in a randomized crossover study involving 27 healthy subjects 14 women 13 men eating freshly chopped chili was found to increase the resistance of blood fats such as cholesterol and triglycerides to oxidation free radical injury subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups for 4 weeks half the subjects ate a freshly chopped chili blend 30 gramsday about 1 ounce consisting of 55 cayenne while the other half consumed a bland diet no chili after 4 weeks the groups were crossed over for another 4 weeks during the intervention periods consumption of other spices such as cinnamon ginger garlic and mustard was restricted blood samples were obtained at the beginning of the study and after each dietary period after eating the chilicontaining diet the rate of oxidation free radical damage to cholesterol and triglycerides was significantly lower in both men and women than that seen after eating the bland diet in addition after eating the chilispiced diet women had a longer lag time before any damage to cholesterol was seen compared to the lag time seen after eating the bland diet in men the chilidiet also lowered resting heart rate and increased the amount of blood reaching the heart clear congestion capsaicin not only reduces pain but its peppery heat also stimulates secretions that help clear mucus from your stuffed up nose or congested lungs boost immunity the bright color of red chili peppers signals its high content of betacarotene or provitamin a just two teaspoons of red chili peppers provide about 6 of the daily value for vitamin c

tract and urinary tract and serve as the bodys first line of defense against invading pathogens help stop the spread of prostate cancer red chili peppers capsaicin the compound responsible for their pungent heat stops the spread of prostate cancer cells through a variety of mechanisms indicates a study published in the march 15 2006 issue of cancer research  capsaicin triggers suicide in both primary types of prostate cancer cell lines those whose growth is stimulated by male hormones and those not affected by them in addition capsaicin lessens the expression of prostatespecific antigen psa inhibits the ability of the most potent form of testosterone dihydrotestosterone to activate psa and directly inhibits psa transcription causing psa levels to plummet the dose effective for test animals was equivalent to 400 milligrams of capsaicin three times a week for a man weighing about 200 pounds after four weeks of receiving capsaicin prostate cancer tumor growth and size decreased significantly in the animals one warning excessive intake of hot chilies has been linked to stomach cancer so dont go overboard prevent stomach ulcers chili peppers have a bad—and mistaken—reputation

protective buffering juices lose weight all that heat you feel after eating hot chili peppers takes energy—and calories to produce even sweet red peppers have been found to contain substances that significantly increase thermogenesis heat production and oxygen consumption for more than 20 minutes after they are eaten lower risk of type 2 diabetes making chili pepper a frequently enjoyed spice in your healthiest way of eating could help reduce your risk of hyperinsulinemia high blood levels of insulin—a disorder associated with type 2 diabetes in a study published in the july 2006 issue of the american journal of clinical nutrition australian researchers show that the amount of insulin required to lower blood sugar after a meal is reduced if the meal contains chili pepper when chilicontaining meals are a regular part of the diet insulin requirements drop even lower plus chilis beneficial effects on insulin needs get even better as body mass index bmi a measure of obesity increases in overweight people not only do chilicontaining meals significantly lower the amount of insulin required to lower blood sugar levels after a meal but chilicontaining meals also result in a lower ratio of cpeptide insulin an indication that the rate at which the liver is clearing insulin has increased the amount of cpeptide in the blood also shows how much insulin is being produced by the pancreas the pancreas produces proinsulin which splits into insulin and cpeptide when secreted into the bloodstream each molecule of proinsulin breaks into one molecule of cpeptide and one molecule of insulin so less cpeptide means less insulin has been secreted into the bloodstream in this study which involved 36 subjects aged 2270 years the effects of three interventions were evaluated subjects were given a bland meal after a bland diet containing no spices a chilicontaining meal after a bland diet and finally a chilicontaining meal after a chilicontaining diet a palatable chili flavoring not pure capsaicin the active component in chili was used blood sugar rose similarly after all three interventions but insulin rose the most after the bland meal after a bland diet and the least after the chilicontaining meal after a chilirich diet the maximum increases in insulin after the bland diet followed by a chilicontaining meal were 15 lower than after the bland meal following a bland diet and 24 lower after the chilicontaining meal after a chilirich diet compared to the chilicontaining meal after the bland diet cpeptide blood levels also increased the most after the bland meal after a bland diet and the least after the chilicontaining meal after a chilirich diet showing the least insulin was secreted after the chilirich diet and meal in addition the cpeptideinsulin ratio was highest after the chilicontaining meal after a chilirich diet indicating an increase in the livers ability to clear insulin besides capsaicin chilies contain antioxidants including vitamin c and carotenoids which might also help improve insulin regulation a little chili pepper can really perk up an omelet add heat to a black beansweet potato soup or transform an ordinary salad dressing so spice up your meals with chili peppers your body will need to make less insulin and will use it more effectively no need to go overboard though population studies in india
