contributing to your appliance repairmans retirement fund not to mention handing over 5 to 10 a month extra to your utility company because the fridge isnt running efficiently do it twice a year or more often if you have shedding pets their fur clogs up the coils fast condenser coils are located on the back of the fridge or across the bottom these coils cool and condense the refrigerant when the coils are clogged with dirt and dust they cant efficiently release heat the result is your compressor works harder and longer than it was designed to using more energy and shortening the life of your fridge clean the coils with a coil cleaning brush and vacuum a coil cleaning brush does a thorough job and will easily pay for itself look for one at appliance parts stores the brush is bendable to fit in tight areas they can be used for cleaning your dehumidifier and air conditioner coils too caution always unplug your fridge before working on itstep 2 clean the condenser fan 5 minutesphoto 1 remove the lower back cover access the condenser fan by rolling the fridge away from the wall and removing the lower back cover with a screwdriver replace the cover when youre finished its essential for good air circulation if the coils are located on the bottom of the fridge like ours clean the condenser fan and the area around it fridges with coils on the back dont have a fan the fan circulates air across the coils to help cool them at times paper dirt dust and even mice can get sucked into the fan and bring it to a complete stop photos 1 and 2 show you how to clean the fan yours could be in a different area but its always next to the compressor most refrigerators will have a diagram on the back or folded up under the front grille showing the location of the major parts while youre under there wipe out the drip pan a flat pan that collects water from the defrost cycle and allows it to evaporate step 3 wipe down the door gasket 2 minutesclean the door gasket wipe the door gasket regularly with warm water and a sponge dont use detergent—it can damage the gasket prevent an expensive gasket repair bill 100 to 200 and cut down air leaks by keeping your door gasket clean syrup jelly or any other sticky stuff dripping down the front sides of your refrigerator can dry and glue the gasket to the frame the next time you open the door your gasket can tear keep it clean and youll get a nice tight seal keeping the cool air where it belongs in the fridge to prevent wear lubricate the door handle side of the gasket by sprinkling baby powder on a cloth and wiping it down once a month three types of refrigerators all refrigerators work on the same principle of cycling refrigerant through two sets of coils the evaporator coils do the cooling and the condenser coils release accumulated heat where fridges primarily differ is in how they defrost a manual defrost is the oldest and simplest type as the name implies you defrost these by turning them off and letting all the ice melt the water then drips into a pan or runs into the fridge where you wipe it up cycle defrost refrigerators have an evaporator plate in the refrigerator section that warms after each running cycle to eliminate frost buildup but you have to defrost the freezer manually by turning a dial to the defrost mode the water in most models flows into a channel in the back and then down through a tube to a drip tray under the fridge the frostfree refrigerator the most common today uses a heater to melt ice on the evaporator coils the heater is turned on by a timer and automatically shuts off an evaporator fan distributes the cold air through the freezer many models have an opening under the crisper drawers to draw water to the drip tray underneath a manual defrost is turned off to defrost a cycle defrost warms an evaporator plate to stop frost build up a frostfree fridge melts ice on the evaporator coils step 4 clear the freezer vents 5 minuteskeep the freezer vents unobstructed clear food packages away from the vent openings and clean the air return so crumbs and twist ties dont clog them these little vents on frostfree fridges allow air to circulate in the freezer dont block them or let crumbs or twist ties get sucked in around the evaporator fan or clog the drain tube to help save energy keep your freezer about three quarters full to retain cold air but dont pack it any fullerthe air needs to circulate step 5 set the temperature controls to the middle settings 1 minuteadjust the temperature controls set the temperature controls to the middle settings make any adjustments according to a refrigerator thermometer the optimum setting for your fridge is between 38 and 42 degrees f the freezer between 0 and 10 degrees this step wont necessarily prevent a repair but itll extend the life of your fridge by allowing it to run more efficiently which reduces your electric bill your fridge has at least two temperature controls except on manual defrost types which have one the one for the food compartment is a thermostat that turns the compressor on and off the second for the freezer is just an air baffle the baffle lets cold air from the freezer sink into the food compartment closing the baffle makes the freezer colder three ways to get the smell out charcoal briquettes absorb the odor just like a filter in a range hood crumpled newspaper the ink absorbs the odor baking soda is the old standby leave an open box in the fridge and replace it every three months for continuous deodorizing charcoal newspaper and baking soda keep the fridge from stinking step 6 clear and clean the drip openings 2 minuteslocate the drip cup find the drip opening on your fridge drip openings allow water that has melted from the defrost cycle to flow down to a pan located by the compressor where it evaporates check your owners manual for the location on your fridge on cycle defrost fridges a channel directs the water to a tube in the food compartment on frostfree types look for a small cap under the crisper drawers that covers a hole or an opening in the back of the freezer or refrigerator if the drain opening clogs water will build up under the crisper drawers and eventually pour out onto the floor troubleshooting service specialists will be the first to admit a ton of their callers dont require repair service at all the solutions are so easy they dont even require a toolbox before you pick up the phone check the following list it just might save you 70 and a bit of embarrassment got power check the circuit breaker or fuse box to be sure powers coming to the outlet is the cord plugged in tight wiggle it around a little a worn receptacle could let the plug fall out just enough for the connection to fail plug a light or any other electrical device into the outlet to see if it works if it doesnt youve got an electrical problem not a refrigerator problem check for a loose worn or frayed power cord rodents often chew through a wire sometimes cords loosen when the fridge is moved what if you have power but poor cooling make sure the thermostat is turned on and set right on some models the dial is easily bumped shutting the fridge down or kids could have messed with it your fridge is running all the time but the foods still warm vacuum the coils dirty coils can eventually cause the overload protector on the compressor to shut the fridge down itll automatically come back on when the compressor cools but by then your food is usually warm is the condenser fan jammed this applies only to fridges with the coils on the bottom remove any obstacles and clean it thoroughly unplug the fridge and turn it a few times and see if it comes on if its still not working youll have to replace it is the light turning off when the doors closed that little light bulb can raise the temperature in the fridge substantially to check it close the door and use a butter knife to pull the gasket slightly away from the frame if light shines out the switch is bad or slightly out of alignment until you fix the switch loosen the light bulb so it goes out look for ice buildup frostfree fridges only bulging on the inside walls or the floor of the freezer manually defrost the freezer by unplugging it its only a temporary fix so call for service required tools for this project have the necessary tools for this diy project lined up
