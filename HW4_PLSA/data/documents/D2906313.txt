1 understand your menstrual cycle your menstrual cycle is the time from the first day of one menstrual period this is “day one” of your cycle to the first day of the next menstrual period a typical cycle lasts 28 days but if you chart your menstrual periods on a calendar you may notice that your own cycle is longer or shorter during the first half of your menstrual cycle before ovulation you menstruate your uterine lining thickens again and hormones begin working to trigger ovulation during the second half of your menstrual cycle after ovulation an egg is either fertilized or the body prepares to shed the uterine lining again your own menstrual cycle may vary by a few days each month and this is not something to worry about however if your menstrual cycle varies significantly by a week or more over a period of several months it is best to see your doctor although there are many nonconcerning causes for variable periods there are some that can be helped with treatment such as polycystic ovarian syndrome where periods come infrequently due to hormone imbalance so a doctors advice is always best if you are in doubt2 know when you ovulate ovulation usually occurs at the midpoint of your menstrual cycle — for women with a typical 28day cycle then ovulation occurs around day 14 if you think you may be experiencing painful ovulation charting your cycles for a few months can help you confirm the timing the second half of the menstrual cycle after ovulation tends to be consistent among women at 14 days 14 days before your next period begins therefore if you happen to have notably longer or shorter intervals between periods as compared to the average of 28 days know that ovulation can be calculated by charting 14 days prior to the start of each period understand that ovulation is when the egg is released by the ovary it entails rupturing the membrane of the ovary at the location where the egg exits which can be accompanied by bleeding and a pressure sensation for many women this goes unnoticed however for some the blood in the abdominal cavity and pressure against the ovarian membrane can be a notable source of discomfort3 note your symptoms if you are experiencing lowerabdominal or pelvic pain or pressure around the midpoint of your menstrual cycle and if this pain disappears within a day and does not reappear until you ovulate again you probably have painful ovulation it could be pain from other internal organs but pain with this specific pattern that repeats most cycles is most often from ovulation you may notice that the pain seems to be on only one side of your abdomen at a time this is because ovulation occurs only on one side or the other and this varies with each menstrual cycle it does not alternate but switches at random pain during ovulation may sometimes be accompanied by minor vaginal bleeding you may also experience some nausea the pain from ovulation tends to last anywhere from a few hours to two to three days approximately 20 of women experience pain midcycle with ovulation in most cases it is relatively mild but in some cases it can be severe and unbearable4 follow up with your doctor as long as the symptoms are not severe painful ovulation is probably harmless nevertheless it’s important to see your doctor and rule out other possible causes of your pain such as ovarian cysts endometriosis or if the pain is worse in any particular episode it may be a more severe and urgent condition such as appendicitis
