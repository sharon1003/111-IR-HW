which takes place each year at the royal albert hall originally great britain was called ‘albion’ by the romans who invaded britain in 55bc but this later became ‘britannia’ this latin word referred to england and wales but was no longer used for a long time after the romans left the name was then revived in the age of the empire when it had more significance the word ‘britannia’ is derived from ‘pretannia’ from the term that the greek historian diodorus siculus 1bc used for the pretani people who the greeks believed lived in britain those living in britannia would be referred to as britanni the romans created a goddess of britannia wearing a centurion helmet and toga with her right breast exposed in the victorian period when the british empire was rapidly expanding this was altered to include her brandishing a trident and a shield with the british flag on a perfect patriotic representation of the nation’s militarism she was also standing in the water often with a lion england’s national animal representing the nation’s oceanic dominance the victorians were also too prudish to leave her breast uncovered and modestly covered it to protect her dignitythe ‘rule britannia’ song that we recognise today started out as a poem cowritten by the scottish preromantic poet and playwright james thomson 170048 and david mallet 17031765 originally malloch he was also a scottish poet but was less wellknown than thomson the english composer thomas augustine arne 17101778 then composed the music originally for the masque ‘alfred’ about alfred the great masques were a popular form of entertainment in 16th and 17th century england involving verse and unsurprisingly masks the first performance of this masque was on 1st august 1740 at cliveden house maidenhead it was at cliveden that the prince of wales frederick was staying he was a german born in hanover son of king george ii his relationship with his father was strained but he came to england in 1728 after his father became king the masque pleased prince frederick because it associated him with the likes of alfred the great a medieval king who managed to win in battle against the danes vikings and linked him to improving britain’s naval dominance which was britain’s aim at this time the masque was performed to celebrate the accession of george i this was the georgian era 17141830 and the birthday of princess augusta there were various influences on the poem scottish thomson spent most of his life in england and hoped to forge a british identity perhaps the reason for the probritish lyrics another of his works was ‘the tragedy of sophonisba’ 1730 rather than giving in to the romans and becoming a slave sophonisba chose to commit suicide this could have had an influence on ‘rule britannia’ with ‘britons never will be slaves’ the words vary slightly between the original poem and the song we know today below is the poem as it appears in ‘the works of james tomson’ by thomson 1763 vol ii pg 1911 when britain first at heaven’s command arose from out the azure main this was the charter of the land and guardian angels sang this strain “rule britannia rule the waves “britons never will be slaves”2 the nations not so blest as thee must in their turns to tyrants fall while thou shalt flourish great and free the dread and envy of them all “rule britannia rule the waves “britons never will be slaves”3 still more majestic shalt thou rise more dreadful from each foreign stroke as the loud blast that tears the skies serves but to root thy native oak “rule britannia rule the waves “britons never will be slaves”4 thee haughty tyrants ne’er shall tame all their attempts to bend thee down will but arouse thy generous flame but work their woe and thy renown “rule britannia rule the waves “britons never will be slaves”5 to thee belongs the rural reign thy cities shall with commerce shine all thine shall be the subject main and every shore it circles thine “rule britannia rule the waves “britons never will be slaves”6 the muses still with freedom found shall to thy happy coast repair blest isle with matchless beauty crown’d and manly hearts to guard the fair “rule britannia rule the waves “britons never will be slaves”the first public performance of ‘rule britannia’ was in london in 1745 and it instantly became very popular for a nation trying to expand and ‘rule the waves’ indeed from as early as the 15th and 16th centuries other countries’ dominant exploratory advances encouraged britain to follow this was the age of discovery in which spain and portugal were the european pioneers beginning to establish empires this spurred england france and the netherlands to do the same they colonised and set up trade routes in the americas and asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries england’s dominance grew hence the significance of ‘rule britannia’ england had been unified with wales since 1536 but only in 1707 by the act of union did england join parliaments with scotland after years of tense relations this occurred because it would benefit both countries scotland’s failed attempt to establish a colony in panama costing £200000 made a union with england look very appealing scotland could use english trade routes without having to pay england which was experiencing fractious relations with the french felt it made sense to have someone on their side to fight for them but also to simply not present a threat themselves the kingdom of great britain the united kingdom had been formed in 1770 captain james cook claimed the east coast of australia setting a precedent for later expansion in the victorian era in 1783 however the nation experienced a setback after the american war of independence in which 13 american territories were lost britain then turned her efforts to other countries to try and establish more permanent colonies in 1815 after years of napoleonic wars france was finally defeated at the battle of waterloo and this heralded the start of britain’s century of power at the height of the empire britannia was in control of approximately one quarter of the world’s population and a fifth of the land mass british empire 1919the original words of the song altered with the fluctuations of britain’s power ‘britannia rule the waves’ later became ‘britannia rules the waves’ in victorian times because britain did indeed rule the waves the famous phrase ‘the sun never sets on the british empire’ at first seems simply hopeful and poignant everglowing and successful however it was actually coined because britain had colonised so many areas across the world that the sun had to be shining on at least one of themthe 19th century though was also a time of growth for germany and america which led to conflict resulting in both world wars in the 20th century this began the decline of the british empire there was also subsequent decolonisation and today only 14 territories remain since 1996 ‘rule britannia’ has been transformed into ‘cool britannia’ this play on words reflects modern britain the stylish nation of music fashion and media it particularly encapsulates the atmosphere and buzz of cosmopolitan london glasgow cardiff and manchester‘rule britannia’ has been so popular that it has been used in a variety of ways in 1836 richard wagner wrote a concert overture based on ‘rule britannia’ arthur sullivan who wrote comedy operas in victorian times quoted from the song too ‘rule britannia’ became the regimental march of the royal norfolk regiment in 1881 and even today some royal navy vessels are called hms britannia the bbc’s last night of the proms always includes an arrangement of the song too ‘britannia’ still conjures a sense of pride and patriotism today“rule britannia britannia rule the waves britons never never never shall be slaves rule britannia britannia rule the waves britons never never never shall be slaves”
