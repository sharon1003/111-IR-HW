presidential motorcade is both the safest and seemingly the riskiest convoy on the planet this globetrotting fleet of vehicles is basically a rolling armored white house complete with its own contingency response force communications office press corps and medical facilities apthe presidential motorcade readly to roll the presidential motorcade is built from a fleet of both custom and sometimes rented vehicles a finite amount of presidential limousines exist with between 16 and 20 being an estimate careful planning and a logistical symphony has to take place in order to preposition the most capable and usually newest vehicles based on the threat level and operating environment at each destination it is not uncommon of for the president to visit three separate cities during a single day especially during campaign season that means three separate motorcade detachments need to be forward deployed to those cities this is done via usaf heavytransports such as c17s or on some occasions a single c5 galaxy usafa pair of presidential limos are loaded onto a c17 globemaster iii in addition to the presidential motorcade being forward deployed to where the president is heading it is now usually customary to deploy a pair of presidential airlift helicopters to the destination regardless of if they are used or not these could be either a pair of “marine one” vh3d sea kings or vh60n black hawks belonging to marine helicopter squadron 1 otherwise known as hmx1 the unit is located along the potomac river in quantico virginia like the motorcade these choppers usually arrive via usaf heavy transport and they are often not seen outside of a local orientation and maintenance check flight that occurs days before the president arrives reuters marine one vh3d and support mv22s all belonging to hmx1 as well as the the beast seen during a presidential visit to manhattan their main mission is to offer the white house and the secret service a contingency presidential transport solution in an any number of types of emergency or special circumstance multiple usaf heavy transports are required to facilitate a single presidential visit and those flights come at a steep cost apthe beast rolls across the apron with c5 galaxy transports in the background the presidential motorcade consists of a wide variety of vehicles the exact configuration changes depending on the mission and the assets at hand but the basic layout diagrammed in this story is fairly customary sometimes extra cars are added in different positions and just because the presidential limousines are in motion the president isnt necessarily inside one of them the protective detail of the secret service are masters of what they do and they know how to optimize their capabilities against a potential enemys weaknesses and strengths generally the presidential motorcade is made up of the following components the drive the key components of the presidential motorcade route car  pilot car the route car runs minutes ahead of the presidential motorcade presumably checking the route and providing guidance for inbound sweepers see below while also providing intelligence to the entire motorcade the pilot car does the same but runs a minute or even just seconds in front of the motorcade it may be accompanied by motorcycle police to cut off key intersections and highway overpasses sweepers these are usually throngs of police on motorcycles and in patrol cars as part of a presidential motorcade they deploy in front of the motorcade clearing the way so that the motorcade’s speed can remain as consistent lead car the lead of the core of the presidential motorcade formation it works as a guide and a buffer for what lies ahead it can be a secret service suburban a local marked police car or really any car the secret service chooses—such as the bmw pictured apa bmw lead car with the presidential limo in tow makes its way through tight streets in the uk presidential limousine code name stagecoach or sparethe presidential limousine rides at the very center of the motorcade “package” what appears to be a very heavy cadillac is really an extremely survivable and luxurious armored car the beast as latest addition to presidential limo history is known is outfitted with a plethora of unique capabilities and countermeasures each one aimed at keeping the president safe and allowing him to rapidly evade danger during an attack whether direct ambush or indirect gassing a city etc paul carter a pair of 2005 dts style presidential limousines in the motorcade the beasts defense capabilities include toplevel ballistic armoring night visioninfrared driving systems a sealed cabin with an independent air supply capable of enduring a nuclearbiologicalchemical nbc attack and even a supply of the president’s blood type other rumored features include infrared smokescreen and oil slick deployment capability as well as tear gas dispensers and frankly just about anything you or tom clancy can think of all of this is in addition to a stateoftheart communications connectivity system including internet and secure telephone communications ap the beast at the capital steps the type was introduced in 2009 the beast which was introduced in 2009 during president obamas inauguration has an imposing stance and looks like the offspring of a cadillac sts and an mrap for all its obvious benefits this coollooking presidential hauler has its detractors the limousine is more of an armored assault truck than a car yet it does not benefit from an assault trucks ground clearance it can be tricky to maneuver on tight city streets is said to be extremely heavy and has broken down while on highprofile missions to be fair the older model was not immune to breaking down either apa secret service agent dusts off the beast while on a mission there are a finite number of these new beast cars and oftentimes the president will be seen riding in a 2005 cadillac dts inspired presidential limousine or even one of the secret services uparmored suburbans that are regularly used to move the vice president and other vvips around apone of the secret services armored suburbans in fact when traveling overseas to especially dangerous locales with questionable road conditions armored suburbans can make up almost the entire presidential motorcade this was the case in iraq where uparmored humvees were used as sweepers the sticks attached to the top of the suburbans in the picture below are the aerials for improvised explosive device jamming equipment white house obama heads to camp victory in baghdad the stagecoach the name for whatever car the president is in is the whole focus of presidential motorcade everything is centered on making sure that car makes it to its destination in addition to stagecoach at least one identical car always accompanies it and sometimes many more these cars known as spares are used as a backup and blocking vehicle should potuss vehicle have a mechanical issue or is attacked as well a serving as decoys while the motorcade is in motion highly trained secret service drivers execute a classic roving shell game weaving stagecoach and spare or spares in and out among each other so that a wouldbe attacker would have a tough time picking the car actually containing the president the presidential limousines even have identical plates apa pair of beasts act as stagecoach and spare the secret service agents that drive the presidential limousines are among the best and most trusted personnel in the institution they go through constant drills at the secret service’s sprawling james j rowley training complex including defensive and offensive driving courses as well as elaborate lifelike tactical scenarios that bring all the elements of the motorcade together to defeat or evade a whole slew of possible threats white house president  first lady seen in the beast currently the secret service is working on a new presidential limo that should be ready for the 2017 inauguration and will likely replace the 2005 dtsstyle armored limousines that will be over a decade old white house president making a call in a secret service heavily armored vvip suburban presidential security detail suv code named halfbackhalfback is the following car for stagecoach and spare s and it carries the presidents secret service protective detail usually this vehicle is a specially outfitted chevrolet suburban with police lights mounted on a light bar in the interior windows and in the grill this is basically the presidents first line of backup should something occur while en route and it will follow a preplanned set of defensive driving and vip protection tactics based on a long list of contingencies rearfacing third row seating usually has at least one overtly armed secret service agent sitting with the window or tailgate open paul carter the presidents security detail riding in halfback electronic countermeasures vehicle code name “watchtower”this vehicle has large vertical aerials and domes on its spine and actively jams communications and remote detonating devices in some configurations it may also work at detecting incoming projectiles and small unmanned aircraft via shortwave radar this vehicle along with others in the motorcade may also provide laser warning used by some antitank guided missiles and radar warning for the convoy if a threat is detected such as one using a laser for designation and ranging or if a threat radar were detected ir smoke chaff and targeted jamming could be deployed disrupting such an attack paul carter electronics countermeasure vehicle with its unique profile counterimprovised explosive device ied and communications selective and barrage jamming technology have come a long way after almost a decade and half of counterinsurgency warfare in iraq and afghanistan during the height of both wars remotely detonated ieds were the leading cause of casualties among deployed forces systems such as the crew duke have likely saved hundreds if not thousands of lives overseas even more advanced technology has been deployed across afghanistan and iraq on mraps apcs and armored cars during the latter half of the last decade much of which is also likely deployed on this lifesaving support vehicle control vehicle  support vehicles support vehicles usually transport highvalue staff such as parts of the presidents cabinet and their security detail as well as additional security personnel and the presidents doctor the control vehicle carries a top military aid with the highest level of clearance who would assist the commanderinchief during a major military incident giving operational guidance and if need be activating the nuclear football  these vehicles are usually modified suvs such as chevrolet suburbans with enhanced communications and lowprofile police lighting or rented vans apthe presidential motorcade makes its way through traffic on a rainsoaked highway counter assault team vehicles nicknamed hawkeye renegadethese vehicles are also usually black suburbans or some other large suv with police lights rails and running boards for external transport of agents and they always have their rear gates ajar with a heavily armed and armored commando hanging out of the back assault rifle at the ready the secret services counter assault team known as the cat gives the presidential motorcade its heavy hitting combat punch these elite secret service operators selected from a tiny fraction of those who apply carry stateoftheart arms including assault rifles night vision goggles expendables like flash bangs and concussion grenades and sometimes heavy body armor apthe heavilyarmed cat riding in one of the motorcades suburbans the cat is the direct action unit that rapidly counterattacks if the convoy is ambushed or it sets up a defensive buffer if the convoy were about to be attacked meanwhile the presidents security detail would work to rapidly evacuate the president from the scene imagine an advancing overwhelming walllike onslaught of suppressive fire and you get the picture of what these highly trained operators are all about if they cant vanquish a threat as it emerges or immediately extinguish an attack as it is initiated they buy the presidents security detail time and space apthe cat on the move during a mission intelligence division vehicle the id carthis vehicle works as a big picture intelligence node communicating with overwatch and surveillance units local police and other intelligence sources about possible threats or obstacles along the motorcades route the agents in this car try to identify problems before they occur hazard materials mitigation unit this black work truck carries sensors to detect and gear to respond to nuclear biological or chemical nbc weapons attacks that threaten the motorcade it also works as a roving storage vehicle carrying supplies and other classified capabilities paul carter the hazmat mitigation unit on the roll press vans these vehicles are usually large vans that carry the white house press corps in the motorcade obviously this space is reserved for major news outlets and the white house media team this includes a camera wire and general press vans the white house communications agency vehicle code name roadrunnerroadrunner also known as the mobile command and control vehicle is one of the most conspicuous vehicles in motorcade a beefedup suburban it houses a large satellite communications array and posts an antenna farm along its roofline paul carter white house communivation agency vehicle code named road runner this vehicle keeps the president and white house officials securely connected to the world providing encrypted voice internet and video communications via the pentagon’s constellation of hardened communications satellites this vehicle may also be able to handle communications for nuclear arms release roadrunner also helps facilitate secure communications within the motorcade itself think of it as a big rolling data encryption center wifi hotspot radio repeater and doomsday communications control center ambulance an ambulance is a constant feature at the rear of the presidential motorcade it is there to treat injuries that may occur following an attack a wreck or an unexpected biological event this resource is primarily reserved for the president paul carter an ambulance is always in tow rear guard this is usually a phalanx of local police vehicles such as motorcycles and marked patrol cars their job is to provide early warning and a defensive buffer for the rear of the motorcade apa brace of police motorcycle officers makes up the rear guard overwatch when the president travels the secret service gets access to a department of homeland security helicopter that provides intelligence planning and overwatch for presidential movements depending on where the president is headed this mission can be executed using a coast guard border patrol us customs or other federal government chopper paul carter a secret service agent peers out the side of a uscg mh60t ground force one although rarely deployed in presidential travel a pair of heavily modified and thickly armored buses were procured by the secret service around the turn of the decade the joint project between prevost car and hemphill brothers coach company known as the model x345 vip 3 allows the president to travel more efficiently by road in rural areas when many stops are on the schedule apthe blackedout ground force one sits at the ready once delivered these roving white houses were painted gloss black and had advance communications installed to interconnect them with roadrunner and the world beyond as well as other improvements similar to what you would find in the presidential limousine both limo buses were used leading up to the 2012 election with president obama using them to campaign across americas heartland apobama waving from the entry of ground force one so there you have it the real anatomy of the presidential motorcade on a personal note i have had the pleasure to see the whole motorcade air force one marine one secret service ballet multiple times with my own eyes it is an absolutely amazing spectacle to watch the incredible focus and professionalism of everyone involved and the way they balance time and risk is mind boggling when you think of the term welloiled machine this is the picture that should pop into your head there is an absolutely astonishing amount of moving parts that go into each and every presidential movement white house the presidential motorcade touring jordans historical sites the times ive had the privilege to watch air force one’s arrival and departure the motorcade moved into formation almost magically zooming up to the president at the exact moment and speeding triumphantly across the tarmac in a wheellike formation when he returned once stopped at the steps of air force one—just as its jet engines were spooling up—the president got out of his limousine ran up the stairs and waved goodbye the cabin door shutting after he entered at that exact moment the iconic 747 was rolling down the apron meanwhile the motorcade was ripping off back across the tarmac to prepare for transport it is a single fluid and perfectlytimed set of movements i had never seen anything like it in my life and it plays far different in person than on television what i took away from these experiences including observing the throngs of sharp shooters and heavily armed men and women staring at virtually everything behind tinted sunglasses is this is not only a critical mission but it is also an art form and a showcase of what we are capable of as a nation apthe presidential motorcade speeds across the tarmac after leaving air force one i have seen this in the military before—to varying degrees and especially in top tier units where it is not just about schedules or procedures but also about nailing it exactly the same way every time and making it look easy of course its anything but easy and the secret service has to get it right every time all the technology that goes into protecting the president is amazing and frankly so is the price tag but there is a reason why this incredible traveling show perhaps the most expensive in the world rarely makes news beyond the objective of the mission itself that is because the people orchestrating it are absolutely the best at what they do and they go about their business knowing that the world is watching apthe presidential motorcade moves along highway 101 sure there have been recent controversies but the white house arm of the secret service is a national treasure they have a mind blowingly difficult job and they deserve much more recognition than they will ever receive the fact that the most powerful and targeted man on earth can drive around where he wants to go on a regular basis and it all seems
