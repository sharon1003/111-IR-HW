for three years a pastime for millions of web surfers — is now a way to make a living one year after you tube the online video powerhouse invited members to become “partners” and added advertising to their videos the most successful users are earning sixfigure incomes from the web site for some like michael buckley the selftaught host of a celebrity chatter show filming funny videos is now a fulltime job mr buckley quit his day job in september after his online profits had greatly surpassed his salary as an administrative assistant for a music promotion company his thriceaweek online show “is silly” he said but it has helped him escape his creditcard debt mr buckley 33 was the parttime host of a weekly show on a connecticut public access channel in the summer of 2006 when his cousin started posting snippets of the show on you tube the comical rants about celebrities attracted online viewers and before long mr buckley was tailoring his segments called “what the buck” for the web mr buckley knew that the show was “only going to go so far on public access”“but on you tube” he said “i’ve had 100 million views it’s crazy”all he needed was a 2000 canon camera a 6 piece of fabric for a backdrop and a pair of work lights from home depot mr buckley is an example of the internet’s democratizing effect on publishing sites like you tube allow anyone with a highspeed connection to find a fan following simply by posting material and promoting it online recent comments eldecember 11 2008ive been following what the buck for several months and look forward to michael buckleys regular postings on both wtb and peron75 jrdecember 11 2008i love michael buckley i discovered him when one of his videos was featured on you tube and he was the first channel i subscribed to he gina mc nallymalanga december 11 2008way to go michael buckleyyou tube can be an overwhelming place and often confusing to new users once you get past the head scratching a see all comments granted building an audience online takes time “i was spending 40 hours a week on you tube for over a year before i made a dime” mr buckley said — but at least in some cases it is paying off mr buckley is one of the original members of you tube’s partner program which now includes thousands of participants from basement video makers to big media companies you tube a subsidiary of google places advertisements within and around the partner videos and splits the revenues with the creators “we wanted to turn these hobbies into businesses” said hunter walk a director of product management for the site who called popular users like mr buckley “unintentional media companies”you tube declined to comment on how much money partners earned on average partly because advertiser demand varies for different kinds of videos but a spokesman aaron zamost said “hundreds of you tube partners are making thousands of dollars a month” at least a few are making a fulltime living mr buckley said he was earning over 100000 from you tube advertisements the program is a partial solution to a nagging problem for you tube the site records 10 times the video views as any other videosharing web site in the united states yet it has proven to be hard for google to profit from because a vast majority of the videos are posted by anonymous users who may or may not own the copyrights to the content they upload while you tube has halted much of the illegal video sharing on the site it remains wary of placing advertisements against content without explicit permission from the owners as a result only about 3 percent of the videos on the site are supported by advertising michael buckley quit his day job in september he says his online show is “silly” but it helped pay off creditcard debt christopher capozziello for the new york times but the company has high hopes for the partner program executives liken it to google ad sense the technology that revolutionized advertising and made it possible for publishers to place text advertisements next to their content“some of these people are making videos in their spare time” said chad hurley a cofounder of you tube “we felt that if we were able to provide them a true revenue source they’d be able to hone their skills and create better content”in a time of media industry layoffs the revenue source — and the prospect of a oneperson media company — may be especially appealing to users but video producers like lisa donovan who posts sketch comedy onto you tube and attracted attention in the fall for parodies of gov sarah palin of alaska do not make it sound easy “for new users it’s a lot of work” ms donovan said “everybody’s fighting to be seen online you have to strategize and market yourself”sign up for the allnew deal book

majored in psychology in college and lives with his husband and four dogs in connecticut films his show from home each episode of “what the buck” is viewed an average of 200000 times and the more popular ones have reached up to three million people he said that writing and recording five minutes’ worth of jokes about britney spears ’s comeback tour and miley cyrus ’s dancing abilities is not as easy as it looks “i’ve really worked hard on honing my presentation and writing skills” he said as his traffic and revenues grew mr buckley had “so many opportunities online that i couldn’t work anymore” he quit his job at live nation the music promoter to focus fulltime on the web show there is a symmetry to mr buckley’s story some socalled internet celebrities view you tube as a stepping stone to television but mr buckley started on tv and found fame on you tube three months ago he signed a development deal with hbo an opportunity that many media aspirants dream about still “i feel you tube is my home” he said “i think the biggest mistake that any of us internet personalities can make is establish ourselves on the internet and then abandon it”cory williams 27 a you tube producer in california agrees mr williams known as smpfilms on you tube has been dreaming up online videos since 2005 and he said his big break came in september 2007 with a music video parody called “the mean kitty song” the video which introduces mr williams’ evil feline companion has been viewed more than 15 million times on a recent day the video included an advertisement from cocacola mr williams who counts about 180000 subscribers to his videos said he was earning 17000 to 20000 a month via you tube half of the profits come from you tube’s advertisements and the other half come from sponsorships and product placements within his videos a model that he has borrowed from traditional media on you tube it is evident that established media entities and the upandcoming users are learning from each other the amateur users are creating narrative arcs and onceaweek videos enticing viewers to visit regularly some like mr williams are also adding productplacement spots to their videos meanwhile brandname companies are embedding their videos on other sites taking cues from users about online promotion mr walk calls it a subtle “crosspollination” of ideas some of the partners are major media companies the ones with the most video views include universal music group sony bmg cbs and warner brothers but individual users are now able to compete alongside them mr buckley who did not even have highspeed internet access two years ago said his you tube hobby had changed his financial life“i didn’t start it to make money” he said “but what a lovely surprise”a version of this article appears in
