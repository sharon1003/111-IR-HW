who discovered potassium the chemical element that bears the symbol k potassium has an atomic mass of 390983 and an atomic number of 19 this alkali metal is soft and has a color of silvery white it reacts to water and it oxidizes in air aside from this the element can produce enough heat to burn evolved form of hydrogen this element is commonly found in seawater as well as in ionic salt various fruits are also rich in this element to know more about this important chemical element it is best to start with the discovery of potassium historical background who discovered potassium the alkali metal was discovered by sir humphry davy in 1807 in england the discovery of the element happened when he used electrolysis to process caustic potash according to records it is the first alkali metal to be discovered using electrolysis at first there are no distinctions between potassium and sodium however after the 18th century davy performed the technique once again and extracted sodium at this time he was able to identify the different characteristics and properties of the two elements additional information and other important details potassium is a very important element because it helps improve our health conditions medical experts agree that this alkali metal is necessary for our survival in order to improve humanâ€™s intake of the chemical element experts add this in processed additives and drinks like tomato paste and orange juice aside from these people can also get high level of this element in fruits and vegetables including potatoes bananas white beans and beet greens other sources of potassium are baking powder and table salt aside from food applications the chemical element has biological applications the element can be used as fertilizers to plants in the form of chloride nitrate and sulfate in addition to this potassium chloride is also important to stop the functioning of the heart which is significant to heart surgery moreover the solution of the chloride is used in lethal injection when it comes to the industrial applications chemists vaporize the element in order to use it in various kinds of magnetometers potassium chromate is very useful in the production of dyes inks fireworks and explosives this element is also helpful in the creation of fly paper and leather tanning finally potassium chlorate is a very essential element in safety matches percussion caps it is also used in developing an effective weed killer which is significant to enhance the growth of different plant species rating 89 10 55 votes castwho discovered potassium 89 out of 10 based on 55 ratings related posts who discovered sodium sodium is described as a highly reactive silverywhite and soft metal it belongs to the same group as rubidium potassium and lithium there are many important things to know about this highly essential element including who discovered sodium who discovered magnesium magnesium is an important chemical element that improves the functioning of numerous enzymes in human body this element has various industrial agricultural and medicinal uses in order to know more about this element it is important to start with the discovery and extraction of magnesium who discovered the element lithium as part of the periodic table lithium is represented by the atomic number 3 and the chemical symbol li it is generally described as a silverwhite and soft metal aside from these highly valuable details it is nice to know something about its history including who discovered the element lithium who discovered aluminum once as precious as gold now as common as tin the rush to obtain aluminum once sparked the curiosity of the most noted scientific minds in the world who discovered zinc zinc is a chemical element that is commonly used to produce alloys like brass and commercial bronze before learning the different uses of the element it is best to take a look at the history if the discovery of zinc
