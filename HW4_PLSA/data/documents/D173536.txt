drug recordpennyroyal oil mentha pulegiumoverview case report product information chemical formula and structure references other reference links overviewpennyroyal oil introduction pennyroyal is an herbal extract or oil derived from leaves of the plant in the mint genus mentha pulegium that was used in the past as an insect repellent and an abortifacient when taken by mouth pennyroyal oil is highly toxic and has been linked to several instances of toxic liver injury and death background pennyroyal is derived from leaves of either mentha pulegium or hedeoma pulegoides plants of the mint family that are native to europe pennyroyal extract contains many components but primarily contains the volatile oil pulegone and other monoterpenes pennyroyal has a strong fragrance similar to spearmint and was used for centuries to flavor food wine and herbal teas pennyroyal extracts were also used as a traditional herb and folk remedy a particular use was to stimulate menstruation and in higher concentrations to induce abortion pennyroyal tea and leaf extracts have been used without serious side effects pennyroyal oil however is highly toxic and even small doses one tablespoon 15 m l can cause syncope seizures coma cardiopulmonary collapse acute liver injury renal insufficiency and multiorgan failure currently pennyroyal oil is used in aromatherapy as a bath additive and as an insect repellent but is not recommended to be taken internally hepatotoxicity there have been many reported cases of pennyroyal oil toxicity usually arising within a few hours of ingestion cardiovascular collapse with disseminated intravascular coagulation is the usual presentation but some patients develop acute liver injury with marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels and early signs of liver failure such as prolongation of the prothrombin time and hepatic encephalopathy the clinical pattern of liver injury is acute hepatic necrosis that if severe can lead to acute liver failure and death immunoallergic features are uncommon liver biopsy shows marked centrilobular necrosis which can resemble shock or acute acetaminophen overdose mechanism of injury the toxic principal in pennyroyal oil appears to be pulegone which is converted by the cytochrome p450 system cyp 1a2 and 2e1 to other hepatotoxins pulegone and its products deplete glutathionine levels and attempts at treating pennyroyal toxicity with nacetyl cysteine are appropriate pennyroyal oil contains 85 pulegone and can cause acute multiorgan injury including acute hepatic necrosis in experimental animals outcome and management pennyroyal oil is not recommended for oral intake but cases of hepatotoxicity continue to be reported largely from accidental or suicidal intake of the oil or its use as an abortifacient glutathionine has been shown to detoxify the toxic metabolites of pulegone and nacetylcysteine should be administered in a manner similar to what is recommended for acetaminophen overdose drug class herbal and dietary supplements top of page case reportpennyroyal oil case 1 acute hepatitis due to pennyroyal oil modified from sullivan jb jr rumack bh thomas h jr peterson rg bryson p pennyroyal oil poisoning and hepatotoxicity jama 1979 242 28734 pub med citationan 18 year old girl developed nausea vomiting abdominal pain agitation and confusion starting a few hours after taking one ounce of pennyroyal oil in an attempt to induce abortion she had drunk pennyroyal tea many times in the past to induce menstruation she had no history of liver disease alcohol abuse or risk factors for viral hepatitis but had been depressed and the ingestion of pennyroyal oil may have been a suicide attempt on examination vital signs were stable except for tachypnea laboratory tests including serum aminotransferase levels were normal except for a metabolic acidosis approximately 40 hours after admission she was found to have evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation with prothrombin time of 32 seconds low fibrinogen levels and platelet count of 10000μl at this point serum enzyme levels were markedly elevated although serum bilirubin was only 12 mgd l table over the next few days the liver tests worsened and she developed progressive renal insufficiency pulmonary failure and coma requiring intubation she suffered recurrent cardiopulmonary arrest and multiorgan failure from which she died 7 days after the ingestion autopsy showed petechiae in multiple organs pulmonary consolidation and massive centrilobular hepatic necrosis and rupture of the

tragic course and outcome of the pennyroyal oil poisoning resembled acetaminophen overdose with acute hepatic necrosis arising two to three days after the ingestion of the herbal oil accompanied by renal failure metabolic acidosis and generalized collapse the finding of centrilobular necrosis on autopsy also resembles acetaminophen overdose but is also compatible with acute ischemic necrosis the hepatic rupture was perhaps due to the extensive hepatic necrosis and possibly the cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts top of page product informationpennyroyal oil representative trade names
