determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin thereby cooling the body lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid unlike temperature which typically varies significantly between night and day dew point tends to change more slowly so while the temperature may drop at night a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night carlsbad experiences some seasonal variation in the perceived humidity the muggier period of the year lasts for 34 months from june 28 to october 7 during which time the comfort level is muggy oppressive or miserable at least

with 25th to 75th and 10th to 90th percentile bands best time of year to visit to characterize how pleasant the weather is in carlsbad throughout the year we compute two travel scores the tourism score favors clear rainless days with perceived temperatures between 65°f and 80°f based on this score the best time of year to visit carlsbad for general outdoor tourist activities is from early june to early october with a peak score in the first week of august tourism score the tourism score filled area and its constituents the temperature score red line the cloud cover score blue line and the precipitation score green line the beachpool score favors clear rainless days with perceived temperatures between 75°f and 90°f based on this score the best time of year to visit carlsbad for hotweather activities is from late july to early september with a peak score in the third week of august beachpool score the beachpool score filled area and its constituents the temperature score red line the cloud cover score blue line and the precipitation score green line methodology for each hour between 800 am and 900 pm of each day in the analysis period 1980 to 2016 independent scores are computed for perceived temperature cloud cover and total precipitation those scores are combined into a single hourly composite score which is then aggregated into days averaged over all the years in the analysis period and smoothed our cloud cover score is 10 for fully clear skies falling linearly to 9 for mostly clear skies and to 1 for fully overcast skies our precipitation score which is based on the threehour precipitation centered on the hour in question is 10 for no precipitation falling linearly to 9 for trace precipitation and to 0 for 004 inches of precipitation or more our tourism temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 50°f rising linearly to 9 for 65°f to 10 for 75°f falling linearly to 9 for 80°f and to 1 for 90°f or hotter our beachpool temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 65°f rising linearly to 9 for 75°f to 10 for 82°f falling linearly to 9 for 90°f and to 1 for 100°f or hotter growing season definitions of the growing season vary throughout the world but for the purposes of this report we define it as the longest continuous period of nonfreezing temperatures ≥ 32°f in the year the calendar year in the northern hemisphere or from july 1 until june 30 in the southern hemisphere temperatures in carlsbad are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms we nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year time spent in various temperature bands and the growing season the percentage of time spent in various temperature bands frigid  15°f  freezing  32°f  very cold  45°f  cold  55°f  cool  65°f  comfortable  75°f  warm  85°f  hot  95°f  sweltering the black line is the percentage chance that a given day is within the growing season growing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature discarding any excess above a maximum temperature in this report we use a base of 50°f and a cap of 86°f growing degree days the average growing degree days

carlsbad based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from january 1 1980 to december 31 2016 temperature and dew point there are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in carlsbad for each station the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and carlsbad according to the international standard atmosphere and by the relative change present in the merra2 satelliteera reanalysis between the two locations the estimated value at carlsbad is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between carlsbad and a given station the stations contributing to this reconstruction are oceanside municipal airport 70 7 kilometers north and mc clellan–palomar airport 30 7 kilometers southeast other data all data relating to the suns position eg sunrise and sunset are computed using astronomical formulas from the book astronomical tables of the sun moon and planets by jean meeus all other weather data including cloud cover precipitation wind speed and direction and solar flux come from nasas merra2 modernera retrospective analysis this reanalysis combines a variety of widearea measurements in a stateoftheart global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50kilometer grid land use data comes from the global land cover share database published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations elevation data comes from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm published by nasas jet propulsion laboratory names locations and time zones of places and some airports come from the geo

coastal areas especially small islands we further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader
