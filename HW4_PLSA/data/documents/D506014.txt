far as i know its airframe  flaps as required if were doing clean stalls then it should be flaps up if were doing dirty stall it should also be flaps up since we only extend the flaps in stages during the stall entry so why do the a part of the hasell when its going to be flaps up anyway20th feb 2013 2254  2  permalink big pistons forever join date jan 2004location west coast canada posts 3051the a

was always taught that a meant airframe and covered everything from configuration to limits ie gear and flap position what manoeuvres the aircraft was certified for limits such as g and limiting speeds and how much altitude was needed to recover and for big pistons the first l is for location i e area so whoever taught that didnt know what he was talking about last edited by captain capstan

check  ie one l for lookout  is taught with the a for area personally like the original poster i cant see the point of the aircraft check the point of the hasel check is to make sure new pilots are sure the aircraft is prepared for any manoever the configuration that the aircraft is set up for  ie what flaps to set limit speeds etc is a manoever specific sop checks like the hasel should be to ensure flight safety critical items are not missed it should not be a how to fly checklist any aerobatic instructor that needs a mnemonic to make sure they are in a aerobatic as apposed to an non

started aerobatics with the fuel pump switched off as this was in an aircraft with carbureted engine it takes significantly longer for the engine to restore power after inverted flight only then did i remember that i had forgotten the whole hasell check for me the airframe check is a quick glance round the cockpit to check whether everything is how its supposed to be flaps up carb heat off fuel pump on canopy closed and locked loose objects stowed instrument settings correct g meter reset to 0 trim set and so forth to a very large extent it follows the same flow as the pretakeoff checks21st

subdivided by abc as follows a  active airfields b  built up areas c  clouds and controlled airspace unless cleared as we were usually in a matz or atz so i was taught a full hasell as follows height

covered that with the s for security quote location  clear of abcs as above lookout  either a 180 or 2 x 90 deg turns id say the turns are to cover both of these far too many people just say location  clear of airfields built up areas but without flying a steepish turn to check under the wings how can you be sure theres not built up area underneath you so id say the turns are to check whats underneath you just as much as checking for other aircraft in the area as for the a airframe which covers flaps retractable gear park brake some aircraft have a rudder limiter if the park brake is set so you need to be doubly sure its off before aerobatics caged gyros a whole load of stuff can be included in there in a pa28 just doing stalls it only really refers to flaps
