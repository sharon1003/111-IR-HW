effects the movement of and within the body muscletissue in the higher animals is classified as striated smooth or cardiac according to its structureand function striated or skeletal muscle forms the bulk of the bodys muscle tissue and gives thebody its general shape it is called striated because it appears striped in alternating bands of lightand dark when viewed under a microscope and animals have conscious control over most of theirstriate muscles smooth muscle which lines most of the hollow organs of the body is not undervoluntary control but is regulated by the autonomic nervous system smooth muscle fibers arespindleshaped not striated and generally are arranged in dense sheets smooth muscle lines theblood vessels hair follicles urinary tract digestive tract and genital tract its speed of contraction is slower than that of striated muscle but it can remain contracted longer cardiac muscle is striatedlike skeletal muscle but like smooth muscle is controlled involuntarily it is found only in the heartwhere it forms that organs thick walls the contractions of cardiac muscle are stimulated by a special clump of muscle tissue located on the heart the pacemaker although the rate of contractions is subject to regulation by the autonomic nervous system muscle contraction skeletal muscles are attached with some exceptions such as the muscles of the tongue andpharynx to the skeleton by means of tendons usually in pairs that pull in opposite directions egthe bicepsbiceps any muscle having two heads or fixed ends of attachment notably the biceps brachii at the front of the

muscles are classified as phasic or fast twitch and tonic or slow twitch to differentiate between the various lengths of time a muscle may require to move in response to stimulation striated muscle is usuallyconsidered phasic while cardiac and smooth muscle are thought to be tonic perhaps because its action is most varied striated muscle has been studied most extensively thistype of muscle is

some degree of contractility but in muscle fibers specialization has led to thepreeminence of this property in vertebrates three major types of muscle are recognized smoothcardiac and skeletal smooth muscle smooth muscle also designated visceral and sometimes involuntary is the simplest type thesemuscles consist of elongated fusiform cells which contain a central oval nucleus the size of suchfibers varies greatly from a few micrometers up to 002 in 05 mm in length these fibers contractrelatively slowly and have the ability to maintain contraction for a long time smooth muscle formsthe major contractile elements of the viscera especially those of the respiratory and digestivetracts and the blood vessels smooth muscle fibers in the skin regulate heat loss from the body those in the walls of various ducts and tubes in the body act to move the contents to theirdestinations as in the biliary system ureters and reproductive tubes smooth muscle is usually arranged in sheets or layers commonly oriented in different directions the major physiological properties of these muscles are their intrinsic ability to contractspontaneously and their dual regulation by the autonomic nerves of the sympathetic andparasympathetic systems see autonomic nervous system cardiac muscle cardiac muscle has many properties in common with smooth muscle for example it is innervated by the autonomic system and retains the ability to contract spontaneously presumably cardiacmuscle evolved as a specialized type from the general smooth muscle of the circulatory vessels itsrhythmic contraction begins early in embryonic development and continues until death variations in the rate of contraction are induced by autonomic regulation and by many other local and systemicfactors the cardiac fiber like smooth muscle has a central nucleus but the cell is elongated and notsymmetrical it is a syncytium a multinuclear cell or a multicellular structure without cell walls histologically cardiac muscle has crossstriations very similar to those of skeletal muscle anddense transverse bands the intercalated disks which occur at short intervals see heart vertebrateskeletal muscle skeletal muscle is also called striated somatic and voluntary muscle depending on whether thedescription is based on the appearance the location or the innervation the individual cells or fibersare distinct from one another and vary greatly in size from over 6 in 15 cm in length to less than004 in 1 mm these fibers do not ordinarily branch and they are surrounded by a complexmembrane the sarcolemma within each fiber are many nuclei thus it is actually a syncytiumformed by the fusion of many precursor cells the transverse striations of skeletal muscle form a characteristic pattern of light and dark bandswithin which are narrower bands these bands are dependent upon the arrangement of the two sets of sliding filaments and the connections between them see muscle proteins muscular system mc grawhill concise encyclopedia of bioscience © 2002 by the mc grawhill companies inc the following article is from the great soviet encyclopedia 1979 it might be outdated or ideologically biased musclethe body tissue of the skeletal and visceral musculatures muscles enable animals and man to perform very important physiological functions such as movement of the body or its individual partsblood circulation respiration passing of chyme through the digestive organs maintenance of vascular tonus and excretion the contractile function of all types of muscles is due to the transformation of chemical energy fromcertain biochemical processes into mechanical work this transformation occurs within the musclefibers however the contraction of skeletal and visceral muscles is only a particular case of a moregeneral phenomenon—the mechanochemical activity of living structures the most variedmanifestations of this activity for example the contraction of the tail of a spermatozoon themovement of cilia in infusorians the disjunction of chromosomes during mitosis and the injection of phage dna into bacteria appear to be based on the same molecular mechanism this commonmechanism involves a change in the conformation or the relative position of the fibrillar structures in contractile proteins classification morphologists distinguish two main types of muscles striated and smooth striatedmuscles include the entire skeletal musculature which makes voluntary movement possible in vertebrate animals and in man muscles of the tongue and upper third of the esophagus heartmuscle or myocardium which has a unique protein composition and contractile nature andmuscles of arthropods and some other invertebrates smooth muscles make up most of themusculature of invertebrates in animals and man the muscular layers of the viscera and of the walls of blood vessels are also made up of smooth muscles these muscular layers take part in the mostimportant physiological functions some histologists distinguish a third type of muscle in invertebrates muscle with double oblique striation structural elements all types of muscles consist of muscle fibers striated muscle fibers in skeletal muscles form bundles joined together by layers of connective tissue the ends of musclefibers are intertwined with tendon fibers and through this combination muscular tension is transmitted to the skeletal bones striated muscle fibers are giant polynucleated cells ranging from 10 to 100 μ in diameter they are frequently as long as the muscles themselves reaching a length of 12 cm in some human muscles the fiber is covered with an elastic sheath or sarcolemma thecell is filled with a sarcoplasm that contains such organelles as mitochondria ribosomes thetubules and vacuoles of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and of the tsystem and various inclusionbodies the sarcoplasm usually contains bundles of numerous threadlike structures myofibrils which arealso crossstriated like the muscles of which they are a part myofibrils are from 05 μ to severalmicrons thick every myofibril is divided into several hundred segments 25 to 3 μ in length calledsarcomeres every sarcomere consists in turn of alternating bands that differ in optical density andimpart to the myofibrils and to muscle fiber as a whole a characteristic striation that can be clearlyseen under a phasecontrast microscope the darker bands are birefringent and are calledanisotropic or a bands the lighter bands do not have this capacity and are called isotropic or i bands the middle of the a band is occupied by a zone of weaker birefringence the h zone the iband is divided into the two equal halves of the dark z membrane which separates one sarcomerefrom another every sarcomere has two types of filaments which consist of the muscle proteinsthick myosin and thin actin smooth muscle fibers have a somewhat different structure they are spindleshaped mononuclearcells lacking crossstriations they are usually 50–250 μ long and 4–8 μ wide uterine smoothmuscle fibers are 500 m μ long smooth muscle myofilaments are usually not combined intoseparate myofibrils but are arranged along the length of the fiber in the form of numerous single actinfilaments there is no ordered system of myosin filaments in smooth muscle cells tropomyosin a fibers in the smooth musculature of mollusks appear to play a major role in performing the obturatorfunction closing of the shell chemical composition the chemical composition of muscles varies with the species with the age of the animal with the type and the functional condition of the muscle and with some other factors the principal constituents of human and animal striated muscles are presented in table 1 table 1 chemical components of striated muscle in percent

for most of the solid mass a distinction is made between the myofibrillar contractile proteins myosin andactin and their complex—actomyosin—tropomyosin α and β actins troponin and others and thesarcoplasmic proteins globulin x myogens respiratory pigments—such as myoglobin—nucleoproteins and enzymes that participate in the metabolic processes in muscle the extractivecompounds that participate in metabolism and perform the contractile function of muscle are themost important of the remaining compounds in muscle fiber these include atp phosphocreatinecarnosine and anserine phospholipides which play a major role in metabolism and in the formation of cellular microstructures nitrogenfree substances for example glycogen and its decompositionproducts glucose lactic acid and so forth neutral fats and cholesterol and finally salts of sodium potassium calcium and magnesium smooth muscles differ significantly in chemicalcomposition from striated muscles having a lower content of the contractile protein actomyosin and of highenergy compounds and dipeptides functional characteristics of striated muscles striated muscles are richly supplied with thenerves by which muscular activity is regulated from the nerve centers the most important are themotor nerves which conduct impulses to the muscles causing them to become excited and to contract the sensory nerves along which information about the condition of the muscles reachesthe nerve centers and the adaptatotrophic fibers of the sympathetic nervous system which act on the metabolism and slow the onset of muscle fatigue the combination of a motor nerve and the group of muscle fibers that it innervates is called themotor unit each branch of a motor nerve in a motor unit extends to a separate muscle fiber all themuscle fibers that constitute such a unit contract almost simultaneously when they are excited thenerve impulse causes a mediator acetylcholine to be released at the end of the motor nerve acetylcholine then reacts with the choline receptor at the postsynaptic membrane this increasesthe permeability of the membrane to sodium and potassium ions causing the membrane to becomedepolarized a postsynaptic potential appears a wave of electronegativity then arises in adjacentportions of the skeletal muscle fiber membrane and is propagated along the muscle fiber usually at the rate of several meters per second the elastic properties of muscles change as a result of excitation if the points of attachment of themuscle are not rigidly fixed the muscle contracts performing mechanical work if the points of attachment of the muscle are fixed tension develops in the muscle a latent period ensues betweenthe origin of excitation and the appearance of a wave of contraction or tension muscular contraction is accompanied by a release of heat that continues for some time even after the muscle relaxes the muscles of mammals and man can consist of slow red muscle fibers containing therespiratory pigment myoglobin and rapid white fibers containing no myoglobin rapid and slowfibers differ from one another both in the rate of conduction of the contractile wave and in the wave’sduration in mammals the duration of the wave of contraction in slow fibers is five times as great as in rapid fibers but the rate of conduction is only half as great as in rapid fibers almost all skeletal muscles are of a mixed type that is they contain both rapid and slow fibers either single or phasic contraction of the muscle fibers or tetanic or prolonged contraction canarise depending on the nature of the stimulus tetany occurs when a series of stimulations reaches a muscle at such a rate that each successive stimulation still leaves the muscle in a state of contraction causing a superimposition of the contractile waves n e vbedenskii discovered thatincreasing the rate of stimulation intensifies the tetany but only to a certain limit which he calledthe “optimum” further increases in the rate of stimulation diminishes tetanic contraction to the“pessimum” the onset of tetany is important in the contraction of slow muscle fibers in muscleswith a predominance of rapid fibers maximum contraction usually results from the superimposition of contractions from all those motor units that are simultaneously active to accomplish this thenerve impulses usually reach these motor units asynchronously striated muscles also contain a third type of fiber purely tonic fibers which are especially wellrepresented in the muscles of amphibians and reptiles tonic fibers help to maintain a continuousmuscle tonus tonic contractions are slowly developing coordinated contractions capable of persisting a long time without a significant energy loss muscles in tonic contraction manifest a continuous resistance to any external forces that are applied toward dilating a muscular organ tonic fibers react to a nerve impulse with a contractile wave only at the site of stimulation nevertheless owing to the large number of motor endplates—stimulation sites—a tonic fiber canstill become excited and completely contract such fibers contract so slowly that even at very lowfrequencies of stimulation individual waves of contraction superimpose and merge to produce a single prolonged contraction the prolonged resistance of tonic fibers and slow phasic fibers to a tensile force is ensured not only by the contractile function of the muscle proteins but also by increased viscosity of the proteins the contractile ability of a muscle is expressed in terms of the muscle’s absolute strength the ratio of a muscle’s mass to the area of its crosssection taken at the plane perpendicular to the fibers absolute strength is expressed in kilograms per centimeter squared kgcm 2  for example theabsolute strength of the human biceps is 114 kgcm 2 and that of the gastrocnemius 59 kgcm 2 systematic exercise of muscles increases their mass strength and efficiency however excessivework results in fatigue that is loss of muscular efficiency inactivity causes muscles to atrophy functional characteristics of smooth muscles smooth muscles of the internal organs differsignificantly from skeletal muscles in the manner of innervation excitation and contraction thewaves of excitation and contraction proceed very slowly in smooth muscles in such muscles thedevelopment of a continuous muscle tonus is related as in tonic skeletal fibers to the slow rate of propagation of the contractile waves which merge with one another even after infrequent rhythmicstimulation the phenomenon of automatism activity not caused by the entry of nerve impulsesfrom the central nervous system into the muscle is also characteristic of smooth muscles both thenerve cells that innervate smooth muscle and the smoothmuscle cells themselves have been found to be capable of spontaneous—independent of central nervous system stimulation—rhythmicexcitation and contraction smooth muscles in vertebrates are unique not only in their innervation and histological structure butalso in their chemical composition they have a lower content of the contractile protein actomyosinfewer highenergy compounds particularly atp a low atpase activity in the myosin fraction and a watersoluble variety of actomyosin called tonoactomyosin of great importance to the organism is the ability of smooth muscles to change length withoutincreasing the tension exerted such a situation arises for example during the filling of holloworgans such as the urinary bladder and stomach i i i vanovskeletal muscles in man skeletal muscles in man which differ from one another in shape sizeand position constitute about 40 percent of the body mass upon contracting the muscle canshorten to 60 percent of its length the longer the muscle the longest muscle the sartorius is 50 cm long the greater its range of movements contraction of a domeshaped muscle for examplethe diaphragm results in flattening while contraction of a ringshaped muscle for example a sphincter results in constriction or closure of the opening that the muscle surrounds a radialmuscle on the other hand widens the opening when it contracts the contraction of muscles thatare located between bony prominences and the skin changes the shape of the skin surface all skeletal or somatic muscles can be classified according to their location into muscles of thehead these include the facial muscles and the masseter muscles controlling the lower jaw andmuscles of the neck the trunk and the extremities since truncal muscles cover the chest andform the walls to the abdominal cavity they are divided into thoracic abdominal and spinalmuscles muscles of the extremities are classified according to which segment of the skeleton theyare associated with in the upper extremities there are the muscles of the shoulder girdle of theshoulder of the forearm and of the hand in the lower extremities there are the muscles of the pelvicgirdle of the hip of the shin and of the foot in man there are about 500 muscles attached to the skeleton some of them are large for examplethe quadriceps femoris while others are small for example the short muscles of the back workthat involves several muscles is performed synergistically although some functional muscle groupswork antagonistically when carrying out certain movements for example the biceps and thebrachialis muscles in the front of the forearm flex the forearm at the elbow joint while the tricepsbrachii located in back serves to extend the forearm both simple and complex movements occur in the spheroid articulations for example the hip is flexed at the hip joint by the iliopsoas and extended by the gluteus maximus the hip is abducted by the gluteus minimus and the gluteus medius and adducted by five muscles of the medial group of the hip the hip joint is also surrounded by muscles that rotate the hip laterally and medially the most powerful muscles are those of the trunk they include the muscles of the back whichkeep the trunk erect and the abdominal muscles which constitute an unusual formation in manthe prelum abdominale in the course of evolution the muscles of the lower extremities in man havebecome stronger on account of the vertical position of the body they support the body as well as participate in locomotion the muscles of the upper extremities conversely have become moredextrous in order to guarantee the execution of rapid and precise movements on the basis of physical location and functional activity modern science also classifies musclesaccording to the following group the muscle group that controls movement in the trunk head andneck the muscle group that controls movement of the shoulder girdle and the free upper extremityand the muscles of the lower extremity smaller divisions are distinguished within these groups v v k uprhanovpathology of muscles the impairment of contractility and the development of a prolonged muscletonus are observed in the following disturbances to name a few in hypertension myocardialinfarction and myodystrophy in atonia of the uterus intestine and urinary bladder in some forms of paralysis for example after recovery from poliomyelitis pathological changes in the functioning of muscular organs may result from disturbances in nervous or humoral regulation from injuries to any part of the muscles for example in myocardial infarction or from changes at the cellular andsubcellular levels subcellular and cellular disturbances can involve a change in the contractileprotein substrate or a change in metabolism metabolic changes usually occur within the enzymaticsystem that is concerned with the regeneration of highenergy compounds especially atp subcellular and cellular changes may be caused by the insufficient production of muscle proteinsthat follows the impairment of messenger rna synthesis such impairment results in congenitaldefects in the structure of the chromosomal dna this last group of diseases is thereforeconsidered hereditary the sarcoplasmic proteins in skeletal and smooth muscles are of interest not only because theyparticipate in the development of the viscous aftereffect but also because many of them areenzymatically active and take part in the cell’s metabolism when muscular organs are injured as in myocardial infarction or when the permeability of the surface membranes of muscle fibers is impaired enzymes such as creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase aldolase and transaminasemay escape into the blood thus in certain diseases such as myocardial infarctions andmyopathies it is of considerable clinical interest to determine the activity of these enzymes in theplasma referencesengel’gardt v a
