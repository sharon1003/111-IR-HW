how to install an occupancy sensor light switch posted by bob jackson  home automation lights and switches  1this tutorial explains how to install a leviton ods10 occupancy sensor wall switch that is compatible with any light including compact fluorescent lamps cfl and incandescent light bulbs lighting automation the back room in my basement storage area has a light switch at the far side next to the exterior doors the only way to reach the light switch was to stumble in the dark while holding my arms out zombiestyle to avoid running into something my first improvement was to replace the wall switch with one that had an illuminated handle that glowed when the light switch was off so i could at least have a point of reference this helped but was unsatisfactory because i would still trip over the lawn mower and other stuff basement storage room light switch what i needed was an occupancy sensor light switch to sense motion in the room and automatically turn onoff the overhead cfl lights compact fluorescent lights cfl compatible occupancy sensor light switch i purchased a leviton occupancy sensor light switch model pr180 at the local home improvement store only to learn upon reading the product specifications in detail that it won’t work with compact florescent lamps cfl the problem is the pr180 isn’t compatible with the “ electronic ballast ” in a cfl the electronic ballast is the miniaturized circuitry in the base of a cfl bulb that provides the high frequency voltage to power the lamp the pr180 will operate a traditional incandescent light bulb or older style fluorescent lights that use a magnetic ballast magnetic ballasts are characterized by the bulky coil windings after further research i found the leviton occupancy sensor wall switch model ods10 is compatible with all types of lights including compact fluorescent lamps cfl leviton occupancy sensor switch model ods10 versus pr180leviton ods10 occupancy sensor wall switch overview the leviton ods10 has several nice features wide 180 degree sensing zone passive infrared pir sensing technology this means it senses body heat to detect motion red led indicator flashes when motion is sensed adjustable off time delay from 10 to 30 minutes pushbutton manual on and autooff mode for energy savings presentation mode if the lights are on pressing the pushbutton with turn the lights off and ignore motion events until the time delay expires adjustable ambient light level to prevent the light from turning on when there’s natural sufficient light or the you can adjust the switch to turn on the lights unconditionally even in full daylight adjustable detection range two independent adjustable blinders such that motion in adjacent areas doesn’t turn on the light for example so that people walking in the hallway don’t cause the light in the room to turn on5 year warranty the ods10 is available in several colors white ivory light almond and gray to match your home decor the leviton ods10 timer range and light adjustment dials are located behind a snapon cover leviton ods10 occupancy sensor wall switch adjustment dials rear view of the ods10 wall switch obviously electrical wiring should never be performed on a live circuit for personal safety always turn off the electricity before installing leviton ods10 occupancy sensor wall switch rear view the leviton ods10 switch is a bit bulky and requires an electrical switch box at least 234 inches deep leviton ods10 occupancy sensor wall switch side view the leviton ods10 has three wires black – hot line side wire blue – load side wire green – ground wire leviton ods10 occupancy sensor switch wire connections leviton ods10 occupancy sensor wall switch installation these installation steps show how to install the ods10 in a single control light switch application see the leviton ods10 installation instructions if you’re replacing a 3way light switch controlled from two locations – this will require two 2 ods10 wall switches if you’re uncomfortable with electrical wiring or lack the proper tools care and attention please hire a licensed electrician to install the occupancy sensor switch i began by shutting off the electricity to the basement lights at the main circuit breaker panel then removing the old light switch mounting screws to release the switch from the wall box there are two screws – top and bottom i’m working by the light of a battery power lantern unscrew the old toggle light switch from the electrical box identify the line side electrical wire with the circuit breaker off and having removed the toggle switch mounting screws i gently pulled the switch out of the electrical box unfolding the wires see below i installed this leviton illuminated light switch and know for a fact the bottom black wire is the “line side” or “hot” wire that receives power from the circuit breaker panel for a single light switch control the lower black wire is the line side if the switch is off when the handle is in the down position however in a new situation you can’t trust the electrician or maybe the previous homeowner wired the switch correctly so it’s best to verify which black wire is the hot or line side circuit connection toggle light switch pulled out of the electrical box be extra careful in these next steps keep the family kids dogs cats and all distractions away remove all necklaces watches and bracelets to identify the line side hot wire make sure nothing is touching the electrical switch or wires turn on the power at the electrical circuit break panel notice the illuminated switch is now glowing in the off position this immediately tells me the lower black wire is the line side otherwise the switch handle wouldn’t illuminate verify the lower black wire is energized with a noncontact voltage detector the detector will flash and beep to indicate the wire is energized live take care not to touch the exposed side screws or bare wires to avoid an electrical shocktoggle light switch line side hot wire identification a secondary check against faulty wiring is to verify the upper black wire is the load side with no power when the toggle switch is in the off position the noncontact voltage detector is silent indicating the wire is not energized no electricity toggle light switch load side wire verification moving the light switch to the on position completes the circuit and powers the load side black wire turning on the lights the load side wire is now energized with electricity as indicated by the flashing and beeping voltage detector toggle light switch operation load side wire energized the lower black wire is now confirmed as being the line side hot wire and the upper black wire as the load side wire going to the lights tag the line side hot wire turn off the electricity at the circuit breaker panel before proceedingafter shutting off the electricity to the light switch and double checking the circuit is dead with the voltage detector i tagged the line side hot black wire with a small piece of blue tape so i won’t mix up the wires when i remove the light switch toggle light switch line side hot wire tagged with blue tape
