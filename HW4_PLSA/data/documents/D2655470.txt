is a subregion of oceania made up of more than 1000 islands scattered over the central and southern pacific ocean the indigenous people who inhabit the islands of polynesia are termed polynesians and share many similar traits including language family culture and beliefs 1 historically they had a strong tradition of sailing and using stars to navigate at night the term polynesia was first used in 1756 by french writer charles de brosses and originally applied to all the islands of the pacific in 1831 jules dumont durville proposed a restriction on its use during a lecture to the geographical society of paris historically the islands of the south seas have been known as south sea islands 2 and their inhabitants as south sea islanders even though the hawaiian islands are located in the north pacific another term the polynesian triangle explicitly includes the hawaiian islands as they form its northern vertex contents  hide 1 geography11 geology12 geographic area13 island groups131

portion of the mid and southern pacific ocean most polynesian islands and archipelagos including the hawaiian islands and samoa are composed of volcanic islands built by hotspots new zealand norfolk island and ouvéa the polynesian outlier near new caledonia are the unsubmerged portions of the largely sunken continent of zealandia zealandia is believed to have mostly sunk 23 million years ago and recently resurfaced geologically due to a change in the movements of the pacific plate in relation to the indoaustralian plate which served to uplift the new zealand portion at first the pacific plate was subducted under the australian plate the alpine fault that traverses the south island is currently a transform fault while the convergent plate boundary from the north island northwards is called the kermadectonga subduction zone the volcanism associated with this subduction zone is the origin of the kermadec and tongan island archipelagos out of approximately 300000 or 310000 square kilometres 117000 or 118000 sq mi of land over 270000 km 2 103000 sq mi are within new zealand the hawaiian archipelago comprises about half the remainder the zealandia continent has approximately 3600000 km 2 1400000 sq mi of continental shelf the oldest rocks in the region are found in new zealand and are believed to be about 510 million years old the oldest polynesian rocks outside of zealandia are to be found in the hawaiian emperor seamount chain and are 80 million years old geographic area  editpolynesia is generally defined as the islands within the polynesian triangle although there are some islands that are inhabited by polynesian people situated outside the polynesian triangle geographically the polynesian triangle is drawn by connecting the points of hawaii new zealand

polynesian settlements in papua new guinea the solomon islands the caroline islands and in vanuatu an island group with strong polynesian cultural traits outside of this great triangle is rotuma

linguistic archaeological and human genetic ancestry a subset of the seamigrating austronesian people tracing polynesian languages places their prehistoric origins in the malay archipelago and ultimately in taiwan between about 3000 and 1000 bc speakers of austronesian languages began spreading from taiwan into island southeast asia 8 9 10there are three theories regarding the spread of humans across the pacific to polynesia these are outlined well by kayser et al 2000 11 and are as follows express train model a recent c 3000–1000 bc expansion out of taiwan via the philippines and eastern indonesia and from the northwest  birds head  of new guinea on to island melanesia by roughly 1400 bc reaching western polynesian islands around 900 bc this theory is supported by the majority of current genetic linguistic and archaeological data entangled bank model emphasizes the long history of austronesian speakers cultural and genetic interactions with indigenous island southeast asians and melanesians along the way to becoming the first polynesians slow boat model similar to the expresstrain model but with a longer hiatus in melanesia along with admixture both genetically culturally and linguistically with the local population this is supported by the ychromosome data of kayser et al 2000 which shows that all three haplotypes of polynesian y chromosomes can be traced back to melanesia 9in the archaeological record there are welldefined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated with some certainty it is thought that by roughly 1400 bc 12  lapita peoples sonamed after their pottery tradition appeared in the bismarck archipelago of northwest melanesia this culture is seen as having adapted and evolved through time and space since its emergence out of taiwan  they had given up rice production for instance after encountering and adapting to breadfruit in the birds head area of new guinea the results of research at the teouma lapita site  efate island vanuatu and the talasiu lapita site near nukualofa tonga published in 2016 supports the express train model although with the qualification that the migration bypassed new guinea and island melanesia the conclusion from research published in 2016 is that the initial population of those two sites appears to come directly from taiwan or the northern philippines and did not mix with the ‘australo papuans’ of new guinea and the solomon islands 13 the preliminary analysis of skulls found at the teouma and talasiu lapita sites is that they lack australian or papuan affinities and instead have affinities to mainland asian populations 14 dna analysis of modern polynesians indicates that there has been intermarriage resulting in a mixed asianpapuan ancestry of the polynesians research at the teouma and talasiu lapita sites implies that the migration and intermarriage which resulted in the mixed asianpapuan ancestry of the polynesians 9 occurred after the first initial migration to vanuatu and tonga 13 15the most eastern site for lapita archaeological remains recovered so far is at mulifanua on upolu the mulifanua site where 4288 pottery shards have been found and studied has a true age of c 1000 bc based on c14 dating 16 a 2010 study places the beginning of the human archaeological sequences of polynesia in tonga at 900 b c 17within a mere three or four centuries between 1300 and 900 bc the lapita archaeological culture spread 6000 km further to the east from the bismarck archipelago until reaching as far as fiji tonga and samoa which were first populated around 3000 years ago as previously mentioned 18 a cultural divide began to develop between fiji to the west and the distinctive polynesian language and culture emerging on tonga and samoa to the east where there was once faint evidence of uniquely shared developments in fijian and polynesian speech most of this is now called borrowing and is thought to have occurred in those and later years more than as a result of continuing unity of their earliest dialects on those farflung lands contacts were mediated especially through the eastern lau islands of fiji this is where most fijianpolynesian linguistic interaction occurred  citation neededgrinding stones discovered from archaeology in samoa tiny populations may have been involved at first 17  clarification needed although professor matisoosmith of the otago study said that the founding māori population of new zealand must have been in the hundreds much larger than previously thought 19culture  editthe polynesians were matrilineal and matrilocal stone age societies upon arrival in fiji tonga and samoa after having been through at least some time in the bismarck archipelago the modern polynesians still show human genetic results of a melanesian culture which allowed indigenous men but not women to marry in – useful evidence for matrilocality 8 9 20 21atholl anderson wrote that that analysis of mt dna female and y chromosome male concluded that that the ancestors of polynesian women came from taiwan while those of polynesian men came from new guinea subsequently it was found that 96 of polynesian mt dna has an asian origin as does onethird of polynesian y chromosomes the remaining twothirds from new guinea and nearby islands this is consistent with matrilocal residence patterns 22although matrilocality and matrilineality receded at some early time polynesians and most other austronesian speakers in the pacific islands wereare still highly matricentric in their traditional jurisprudence 20 the lapita pottery for which the general archaeological complex of the earliest oceanic austronesian speakers in the pacific islands are named also went away in western polynesia language social life and material culture were very distinctly polynesian by the time eastern polynesia was being settled after a pause of 1000 years or more in western polynesia the dating of the settlement of eastern polynesia including hawaii easter island and new zealand is not agreed upon in every instance most recently a 2010 study using metaanalysis of the most reliable radiocarbon dates available suggested that the colonization of eastern polynesia including hawaii and new zealand proceeded in two short episodes in the society islands from 1025–1120 ad and further afield from 1190–1290 ad 23 with easter island being settled around 1200 24 25 other archeological models developed in recent decades which are challenged by that recent set of radiocarbon dating interpretations have pointed to dates of between 300 and 500 ad or alternatively 800 ad as supported by jared diamond for the settlement of easter island and similarly a date of 500 ad has been suggested for hawaii linguistically there is a very distinct east polynesian subgroup with many shared innovations not seen in other polynesian languages the marquesas dialects are perhaps the source of the oldest hawaiian speech which is overlaid by tahitian variety speech as hawaiian oral histories would suggest the earliest varieties of new zealand maori speech may have had multiple sources from around central eastern polynesia

refers to the northern groups it is unknown when this name was changed to reflect the current name it is thought that the cook islands were settled in two periods the tahitian period when the country was settled between 900  1300 ad the second settlement the maui settlement occurred in 1600 ad when a large contingent from tahiti settled in rarotonga in the takitumu district cook islanders are

there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands as polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on doublehull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes 28 eight of the nine islands of tuvalu were inhabited thus the name tuvalu means eight standing together in tuvaluan the pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the polynesians spread out from samoa and tonga into the tuvaluan atolls with tuvalu providing a stepping stone for migration into the polynesian outlier communities in melanesia and micronesia 29 30 31stories as to the ancestors of the tuvaluans vary from island to island on niutao 32funafuti and vaitupu the founding ancestor is described as being from samoa 33 34 whereas on nanumea the founding ancestor is described as being from tonga 33the extent of influence of the tuʻi tonga line of tongan kings which originated in the 10th century is understood to have extended to some of the islands of tuvalu in the 11th to mid13th century 34 the oral history of niutao recalls that in the 15th century tongan warriors were defeated in a battle on the reef of niutao tongan warriors also invaded niutao later in the 15th century and again were repelled a third and fourth tongan invasion of niutao occurred in the late 16th century again with the tongans being defeated 32fishing was the primary source of

of new zealand were first settled by eastern polynesians who adapted their culture to a nontropical environment unlike melanesia leaders were chosen in polynesia based on their hereditary bloodline samoa however had another system of government that combines elements of heredity and realworld skills to choose leaders this system is called faamatai according to ben r finney and eric m jones on tahiti for example the 35000 polynesians living there at the time of european discovery were divided between highstatus persons with full access to food and other resources and lowstatus persons with

would not ease loss of food energy navigators in particular were highly respected and each island maintained a house of navigation with a canoebuilding area settlements by the polynesians were of two categories the hamlet and the village the size of the island inhabited determined whether or not a hamlet would be built the larger volcanic islands usually had hamlets because of the many zones that could be divided across the island food and resources were more plentiful these settlements of four to five houses usually with gardens were established so that there would be no overlap between the zones villages on the other hand were built on the coasts of smaller islands and consisted of thirty or more houses—in the case of atolls on only one of the group so that food cultivation was on the others usually these villages were fortified with walls and palisades made of stone and wood 40however new zealand demonstrates the opposite large volcanic islands with fortified villages as well as being great navigators these people were artists and artisans of great skill simple objects such as fishhooks would be manufactured to exacting standards for different catches and decorated even when the decoration was not part of the function stone and wooden weapons were considered to be more powerful the better they were made and decorated in some island groups weaving was a strong part of the culture and gifting woven articles was an ingrained practice dwellings were imbued with character by the skill of their building body decoration and jewelry is of an international standard to this day the religious attributes of polynesians were common over the whole pacific region while there are some differences in their spoken languages they largely have the same explanation for the creation of the earth and sky for the gods that rule aspects of life and for the religious practices of everyday life people traveled thousands of miles to celebrations that they all owned communally beginning in the 1820s large numbers of missionaries worked in the islands converting many groups to christianity polynesia argues ian breward is now one of the most strongly christian regions in the world christianity was rapidly and successfully incorporated into polynesian culture war and slavery disappeared 41languages  editmain article polynesian languages polynesian languages are all members of the family of oceanic languages a subbranch of the austronesian language family polynesian languages show a considerable degree of similarity the vowels are generally the same—a e i o and u pronounced as in italian spanish and german —and the consonants are always followed by a vowel the languages of various island groups show changes in consonants r and v are used in central and eastern polynesia whereas l and v are used in western polynesia the glottal stop is increasingly represented by an inverted comma or ‘okina in the society islands the original protopolynesian  k and  ng have merged as glottal stop so the name for the ancestral homeland deriving from protonuclear polynesian sawaiki 42 becomes havaii in new zealand where the original  w is used instead of v the ancient home is hawaiki in the cook islands where the glottal stop replaces the original  s with a likely intermediate stage of  h  it is ‘avaiki in the hawaiian islands where the glottal stop replaces the original k the largest island of the group is named hawai‘i in samoa where the original s is used instead of h v replaces w and the glottal stop replaces the original k the largest island is called savaii 1economy  editwith the exception of new zealand the majority of independent polynesian islands derive much of their income from foreign aid and remittances from those who live in other countries some encourage their young people to go where they can earn good money to remit to their stayathome relatives many polynesian locations such as easter island supplement this with tourism income some have

tupaia who drew a handdrawn chart of the islands within 3200 km 2000 mi radius to the north and west of his home island of raiatea tupaia had knowledge of 130 islands and named 74 on his chart 46 tupaia had navigated from raiatea in short voyages to 13 islands he had not visited western polynesia as since his grandfathers time the extent of voyaging by raiateans has diminished to the islands of eastern polynesia his grandfather and father had passed to tupaia the knowledge as to the location of the major islands of western polynesia and the navigation information necessary to voyage to fiji samoa and tonga 47 as the admiralty orders directed cook to search for the “great southern continent” cook ignored tupaias chart and his skills as a navigator to this day original traditional methods of polynesian navigation are still taught in the polynesian outlier of taumako island in the solomon islands from a single chicken bone recovered from the archaeological site of el arenal1 on

sequences from two archaeological sites on easter island group with an uncommon haplogroup from indonesia japan and china and may represent a genetic signature of an early polynesian dispersal modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for precolumbian chickens and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient dna sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both chile and polynesia 50knowledge of the traditional polynesian methods of navigation were largely lost after contact with and colonization by europeans this left the problem of accounting for the presence of the polynesians in such isolated and scattered parts of the pacific by the late 19th century to the early 20th century a more generous view of polynesian navigation had come into favor perhaps creating a romantic picture of their canoes seamanship and navigational expertise in the mid to late 1960s scholars began testing sailing and paddling experiments related to polynesian navigation david lewis sailed his catamaran from tahiti to new zealand using stellar navigation without instruments and ben finney built a 40foot replica of a hawaiian double canoe nalehia and tested it in hawaii 51 meanwhile micronesian ethnographic research in the caroline islands revealed that traditional stellar navigational methods were still in every day use recent recreations of polynesian voyaging have used methods based largely on micronesian methods and the teachings of a micronesian navigator mau piailug it is probable that the polynesian navigators employed a whole range of techniques including use of the stars the movement of ocean currents and wave patterns the air and sea interference patterns caused by islands and atolls the flight of birds the winds and the weather scientists think that longdistance polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of birds there are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with these flyways one theory is that they would have taken a frigatebird with them these birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly when the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe it is likely that the polynesians also used wave and swell formations to navigate it is thought that the polynesian navigators may have measured the time it took to sail between islands in canoedays’’ or a similar type of expression also people of the marshall islands used special devices called stick charts showing the places and directions of swells and wavebreaks with tiny seashells affixed to them to mark the positions of islands along the way materials for these maps were readily available on beaches and their making was simple however their effective use needed years and years of study 52see also  editgeography portal oceania portal list of polynesians polynesian mythology
