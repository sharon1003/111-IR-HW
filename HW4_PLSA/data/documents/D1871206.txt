what to do if you find orphaned opossumsit is popular with some people to joke about dead possums on the highway besides the obvious there is another reason that it is no joke infant opossums are carried in the mothers pouch and often one or all of them up to 13 can be left initially unharmed by the impact of the car most of us at the national opossum society habitually check the body of hitbycar opossums for living infants if there are none we can at least remove the body from the road to keep it from endangering the life of another animal that may utilize it as food as well as out of respect for the creature if there are infants action should be taken immediatelyplease administer first aid to the orphans following these instructions before you call anyone print this page to refer to the worst dangers to the orphans are chilling and dehydration it is critical that they be gently warmed the easiest and safest way to do this is to wrap them in cloth and hold them against your body once they are no longer cold they may be placed in a boxbasket or plastic container this box should be placed on top of a heating pad set on low layer cotton cloth or fleece in the bottom of the box the infants are placed on top of these layers and covered with more layers of cloth alternative heat sources are plastic bottles of warm water heated rice or bean bags or handwarmers always protect the infants from being in direct contact with the heat source they will get too hot monitor the temperature frequently to make sure that the babies are just slightly warm to the touch do not use terry cloth because of the danger of the little threads getting wrapped around toes or tails tshirts sweat shirts or blankets cut into small squares work great young opossums like other small mammals need stimulation to eliminate this is always true for pouch babies older opossums should also be manually stimulated because even if they would normally be able to eliminate on their own when they get dehydrated they can retain both urine and bowel movements it is much better to be safe than to watch an infant die from a ruptured bladder do this even if you have seen urine or feces produced they may not be emptying completely potty the baby in the following manner hold him in one hand feet down and close to your body and allow him to hide his head between your palm and your body use a wet warm tissue soft cloth or cotton ball and gently stroke the genital area towards the tail until urine or feces or both is produced have clean tissue ready because once he starts to go you should not stop stroking until he is empty remember that what you are imitating is the mothers tongue and that is the sort of frequency and pressure that you are seeking be sure to wipe toward the tail so as not to introduce fecal bacteria into the genital tract note the color of the urine dark medium light to report to your contact and help you assess his hydration now is the time to get on the phone and locate someone knowledgeable about opossum infants so that you can take the infants to them try your local wildlife rehabilitation facility veterinarian zoo animal shelter or audubon society— anyone that deals with the welfare of animals may give you a lead animal control facilities are usually not helpful but you may ask them if they have a list of rehabilitators we may be able to help you locate someone but you are in the best position to find someone in your area an internet search string with the term wildlife rehabilitator and your state will sometimes produce a state specific listing if the infants are very tiny less than three inches long or naked get them to someone experienced immediately the longer they are out of the pouch and not nursing the lower their chances for surviving they require an experienced hand to survive the crisis of being orphaned note other species that have no fur can be mistaken for opossums and vice versa it is unusual for hairless opossums to be found anywhere except in the mothers pouch infant opossums do not squeak or mewl their only cry is a sneezing sound chh chh if they are pink their mouths may be closed except for a small opening directly under the nose if the pinky animal that you have found was laying in the yard or has a high pitched cry or opens its mouth wide it is probably not an opossum but these first aid instructions will aid any small pinky mammal until you can get help if the babies are older and are well furred you may try to give them fluids to keep them hydrated before you transfer them to the experienced caregiver pedialyte is a product available in grocery stores that is used to rehydrate human infants dilute it with distilled water 1 part to 2 parts warm it to body temperature and offer slowly with a dropper even small infants have the ability to lap and some will suckle do not force it as the infant could inhale the fluid just one drop of liquid entering the lungs can mean a protracted death for the baby be careful the mother opossums pouch is specialized environment opossums need very specific care and it can be quite different in many ways from that of other small mammals do not try to raise infant opossums if you dont know what you are doing they will die you cared enough to rescue them now please care enough to take care of them in a way that they have every

make telephone contact although email and websites can give supplemental or emergency information they are not a substitute for direct interaction with a person with experience remember that anyone can put up a webpage and we are seeing increasing numbers of cases where opossums have been harmed by improper even harmful information found on the web an important note regarding formulae we are also seeing infants presenting with hypocalcemic episodes when they have been fed various name brand formula untreated hypocalcemia can quickly result in death in infant opossums remember that a photo
