like to know me 1 following 3 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer ok heres the scoop a dna test can only tell you that you have a percentage of genetic markers in common with known native american or black etc etc samples in the companies database and that is all it can tell you your setting yourself up h ere as an example i will use oprah winfreyshe had a dna test done that told her she descended from the zulu tribe in africa ok heres what the facts are oprah is indeed the descendant of slaves it is proven there were no zulu taken as slaves they live in the central part of africa and the slavers stuck close to the coast so by these facts there is no way oprah could be a descendant of the zulu tribe source senrolled tribal member coolrogue 路 9 years ago1 2

the worlds first largest and best such site i used them and according to the results i have ancestors in more than 30 african countries new zealand australia all over europe etc in addition to native americans i have ancestors amongst the eskimos and innuits they provide you your own webpage a map depicting origins of your ancestors etc you should opt for both the y dna male to male and mt dna female to female they have tutorials to help you understand the whyfors of testing and understanding the results source sgenealogical research nothingusefullearnedinschool 路 9 years ago3 1 comment it is according to your objective you are involved in genealogy and if you want to have your y  mitochondrial tested to see if you match with someone elses family tree i believe the best is httpwwwfamilytreednacomdefaultasp they are the oldest company doing this type of testing and has the largest database when you go into their website if you go under feedback you can email them and ask questions now they will assign you to a haplogroup and show you the origin of your nomadic ancestor going back usually over 100000 years which i dont think is particularly helpful in genealogy it will be in 2 lines only and you come from a vast myriad of family lines y goes from father to son only mitochondrial goes from mother to both sons and daughters but only the daughters pass it on to their children one company that only does y  mitochondrial advertises they will help you discover your deep ancestral roots just understand it is your deep ancestral roots in 2 lines you have 2 parents 4 grandparents 8 great grandparents 16 great great grandparents and so on you get your y from only one in each generation and your mitochondrial from only 1 in each generation for instance when you get back to your 16 great great grandparents y  mitochondrial both will leave out 14 of them however if you are successful at matching yourself with other family trees and making contact with people in those trees you will no doubt discover some of the left out people your 2 sex chromosomes one from each parent are the two that are made up of y  mitochondrial dna they both go back in a straight line virtuallly unchanged most of your dna is autosomal your other 44 chromsomes 22 from each parent are made up of your autosomal dna you get it 5050 from both parents but it is too complicated to use for genealogy purposes when you get back to your grandparents it will not be 25252525 split you get 50 from your paternal grandparents and 50 from your maternal grandparents but it will not be a even breakdown between grandmother and grandfather on both sides of the family how you inherited this bias will not necessarily be how your siblings inherited it unless you have an identical twin there is one company in the u s that i know of that will take your autosomal and match you with population groups throughout the world they will not tell you that you are 12 of something 14 of something else and 14 of another something else that would be impossible as the same dna crosses national racial and ethnic boundaries and there are no pure nationalities races or ethnicities however they will show you your matches in descending order starting with the top the company that does this type of testing is httpwwwdnatribescom when you go into their website if you go under feedback there is a way you can email them and ask questions i asked dnatribes if my sister with whom i share both parents had the same autosomal test would her results be the same and they replied two siblings will each obtain unique results family members do typically share some regional or ethnic genetic affiliations but in some cases matches can vary substantially between siblings family tree dna does do autosomal testing but they will no longer provide you with an analysis i had to send my results from them to dnatribes here are a couple of more links explaining dna httpwwwsmgforgpageshowitworksj
