control severe allergic asthma which does not respond to high doses of corticosteroids it has been approved for treating people 12 years and older with severe or moderate to severe allergic asthma in more than 90 countries since its first of such approval in 2002 in australia omalizumab was approved in march 2014 in the european union and the u s a and in about 10 other countries for treating patients 12 years and above with chronic spontaneous urticaria csu also referred to as chronic idiopathic urticaria or ciu which cannot be treated with h1 antihistamines csu is not an allergic disease omalizumab is a recombinant dna derived humanized ig g1k monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to free human immunoglobulin e ig e in the blood and interstitial fluid and to membranebound form of ig e m ig e on the surface of m ig eexpressing b lymphocytes 1 unlike an ordinary antiig e antibody it does not bind to ig e that is already bound by the high affinity ig e receptor fcεri on the surface of mast cells basophils and antigenpresenting dendritic cells 2ig e is commonly involved in type i hypersensitivity which manifests in the most common allergic diseases it has been estimated that as high as 20 to 40 of the populations who live a western lifestyle in economically advanced countries are affected by allergy and seek medical help 3 in the u s 8 of adults and 10 of children have asthma 4 allergy occurs more frequently in individuals with higher serum ig e levels though some allergic individuals have very low serum ig e and some people with very high ig e have no allergic

treating patients 12 years and older with moderate to severe allergic asthma 5 it has also received approval in many other countries for treating patients 12 years and older with severe persistent allergic asthma omalizumab was approved by the european union in 2009 for treating patients 6 to 12 years old with severe persistent allergic asthma thus its primary use is for patients mostly with severe persistent allergic asthma uncontrollable with oral or injectable corticosteroids 6 those patients have already failed step i to step iv treatments and are in step v of treatment such a treatment scheme is consistent with the widely adopted guidelines for the management and prevention of asthma issued by global initiative of asthma gina which was a medical guidelines organization launched in 1993 in collaboration with the national heart lung and blood institute national institutes of health usa and the world health organization 7 the efficacy is more evident among severe asthmatics than among those with moderately severe disease the response rates among treated severe allergic asthma patients are 6080 or higher probably depending on the patient screening procedures used by the various clinical groups of different specialties in reallife clinical practice of 142 and 195 patients in italy and germany respectively 77 to 79 of patients or physicians gave a response of “excellent or good” for gete global evaluation of treatment effectiveness scale after being treated with omalizumab for four months 8 9 because 20 to 30 of adult asthma cases are not related to allergy 9 a reliable way to identify treatable patients has been a subject of considerable research interest 10 11 the primary benefits for the responding patients are reduced numbers of exacerbations improved lung function reduced numbers of emergency visits to the doctors reduced days of hospitalization and increased quality of life measurements 8 9 the other major benefit is that most responding patients can reduce or spare entirely the use of corticosteroids which cause multiple serious side effects when used at high doses for extended periods 12due to the requirement for longterm administration and hence the high cost of an omalizumab treatment regimen and to the concern over longterm safety treatment is not yet very common especially in developing countries where medical funds are relatively scarce another barrier to wide use is its injectable dosage form which requires the patient to visit a physicians office or clinic every 2 to 4 weeks during treatment in august 2010 the national institute for clinical excellence nice in the united kingdom ruled that omalizumab should not be prescribed on the national health service nhs to children under 12 causing widespread condemnation from asthma charities 13 nice concluded that the high costs of the compound over £250 per vial did not represent a sufficiently high increase in quality of life however on march 7 2013 nice issued “final draft guidance” about the allowance of omalizumab it recommended the drug as an option for treating severe persistent allergic asthma in adults adolescents and children following additional analyses and submission of a patient access scheme pas by novartis the manufacturer 14 some immunologists have also suggested that because ig e may be a natural defense against parasitic diseases treatment should not be recommended when living in environments where the presence of parasites is common chronic spontaneous urticaria  editxolair was approved in march 2014 in the european union and the u s a and in about 10 other countries for treating patients 12 years and above with chronic spontaneous urticaria also called chronic idiopathic urticaria  which cannot be treated with elevated doses of h1 antihistamines chronic urticaria affect about 05 to 1 of the world population and among those patients two thirds have csu and among them about half cannot be adequately treated even with high doses 4 times regular doses of h1antihistamines 15 16 since csu is not an allergic disease and does not obviously involve ig e how omalizumab effectively treats csu is currently a hotly pursued research subject the serum concentrations of ig e in csu patients are generally much lower than those in patients with allergic asthma adverse effects  editthe main adverse effect is anaphylaxis a lifethreatening systemic allergic reaction with a rate of occurrence of 1 to 2 patients per 1000 6 17 like other protein and antibody drugs omalizumab also causes anaphylaxis although at a relatively low frequency among antibody drugs the allergic reaction is probably not due to the binding characteristics of the antibody drug but to the protein nature of the antibody  citation needed the patients who use omalizumab are generally highly allergic thus even though the drug is administered with the purpose to suppress allergy including anaphylactic reactions it does not work immediately after injection it also increases the risk of strokes and heart disease by a small amount 18ig e may play an important role in the immune systems recognition of cancer cells 19 therefore indiscriminate blocking of ig e receptor interaction with omalizumab may have unforeseen risks the data pooled in 2003 from the earlier phase i to phase iii clinical trials showed a numeric imbalance in malignancies arising in omalizumab recipients 05 compared with control subjects 02 6 to clarify this imbalance a more recent study was performed based on pooled analysis using much more comprehensive data from 67 phase i to iv clinical trials the prespecified primary analysis assessed the incidence of primary malignancy in 32 randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled rdbpc trials in this analysis there were 11459 unique patients in all clinical trials 7789 received omalizumab the primary analysis identified malignancies in 25 patients rdbpc trials 14 in 4254 omalizumabtreated patients and 11 in 3178 placebotreated patients incidence rates per 1000 patientyears of observation time for omalizumab and placebotreated patients were 414 95 ci 226694 and 445 95 ci 222794 respectively the corresponding rate ratio was 093 95 ci 039227 primary malignancies were of varying histologic type and occurred in a number of different organ systems no cluster of histologies was identified the study thus concluded that in this pooled analysis no association was observed between omalizumab treatment and risk of malignancy in rdbpc trials the rate ratio was below unity the data suggest that a causal relationship between omalizumab therapy and malignancy is unlikely 20concerns were raised earlier about possible induction of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis churgstrauss syndrome a rare form of systemic vasculitis associated with asthma in patients receiving the drug 21 a retrospective review which identified and analyzed cases of churgstrauss syndrome using the novartis argus global drug safety database for omalizumab in asthma patients has indicated that churgstrauss syndrome may develop in patients who have an underlying eosinophilic disorder that is unmasked by the withdrawal of corticosteroids which is common among patients receiving this treatment 22mechanism of action  editpersons with allergy are sensitized to make immune response to several or many proteins contained in one or more of the hundreds of harmless environmental substances which they take in by inhalation eg house dust mites pollens molds pet animal dander and other airborne allergens and ingestion eg wheat gluten peanuts nuts shellfish and other food allergens or through the skin eg bee and fire ant stings latex gloves in these individuals the ig e molecules both allergenspecific and allergennonspecific ones in their bodies bind to the high affinity ig e receptor fcεri on the surface of mast cells and basophils under certain conditions including but not limited to when the allergenic substances are taken in by a sensitized individual at substantial amounts the allergenic proteins bind to the allergenspecific ig e bound by fcεri on the surface of mast cells and basophils and trigger the activation of those inflammatory cells which release a host of pharmacological mediators such as histamine leukotrienes tryptase inflammatory cytokines and others causing various allergic symptomsdiseases the rationale for designing the antiig e therapeutic antibodies and the pharmacological mechanisms of antiig e therapy have been summarized in review articles by the inventor of the antiig e therapy tse wen chang and his colleagues 2 23 24 omalizumab inhibits the binding of ig e to fcεri on mast cells and basophils by binding to an antigenic epitope on ig e that overlaps with the site to which fcεri binds this feature is critical to its pharmacological effects because a typical antiig e antibody can crosslink cell surface fcεribound ig e thereby aggregate fcεri and activate mast cells and basophils to discharge the horde of chemical mediators stored in the densely packed sacs inside the cells however when ig e is bound to the receptor the antigenic epitope on ig e to which omalizumab binds is sterically hindered by the receptor and is not accessible to omalizumab binding thus averting the anaphylactic effects presumably unavoidable with an ordinary antiig e antibody  furthermore although the peptide elements on ig e involved in binding to low affinity ig e receptor  fcεrii on many cell types are different from the peptide elements involved in binding to fcεri omalizumab by steric hindrance also prevents binding of ig e to fcεrii the reduced binding of ig e to both fcεri and fcεrii has profound effects on the attenuation of ig emediated allergic responses perhaps the most dramatic effect which was not foreseen at the time when the antiig e therapy was designed and which was discovered during the clinical trials is that as the free ig e in patients is depleted by omalizumab the fcεri receptors on basophils mast cells and dendritic cells are gradually downregulated with somewhat different kinetics rendering those cells much less sensitive to the stimulation by allergens 25 26 27 thus in this regard therapeutic antiig e antibodies represent a new class of potent mast cell stabilizers 24 providing the fundamental mechanism for omalizumabs effects on various allergic and nonallergic diseases involving mast cell degranulation many investigators have identified or elucidated a host of pharmacological effects which help bring down the inflammatory status in the omalizumabtreated patients 28 29 30ig e in allergic diseases  editcorticosteroids of various chemical structures and formulations which offer various desired potency and pharmacokinetics and which generally effectively suppress inflammatory processes systemically or locally have been the mainstay of medicine to treat the severe cases of various allergic diseases before the introduction of omalizumab moderate to severe cases of asthma regardless of their allergic or nonallergic nature had been generally treated with corticosteroids and bronchodilators clinicians had not had persuasive reasons to dissect the role of ig e or more precisely its relative importance among various immune factors and pharmacological mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma and various other allergic diseases and conditions the availability of omalizumab as a drug to intervene the ig e pathway has provided many clinical researchers the opportunities to examine the role of ig e in various allergic diseases and in some cases diseases that are not obviously considered as allergic diseases in conjunction with achieving the practical goal to investigate the applicability of the antiig e therapy as a potential treatment for allergic diseases the many corporatesponsored clinical trials of tnx901 and omalizumab on asthma allergic rhinitis peanut allergy chronic idiopathic urticaria atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases have helped define the role of ig e in the pathogenesis of these prevalent allergic diseases for example the clinical trial results of omalizumab on asthma have unambiguously settled the long debate whether ig e plays a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma 29 the availability of the drug as a treatment option for patients with severe persistent allergic asthma has gradually persuaded the physicians treating severe asthma patients to determine whether their asthma is allergic or nonallergic in nature numerous investigatorinitiated case studies or smallscale pilot studies of omalizumab have been performed on various allergic diseases and several nonallergic diseases especially inflammatory skin diseases these diseases include atopic dermatitis various subtypes of physical urticaria solar coldinduced local heatinduced or delayed pressureinduced and a spectrum of relatively less prevalent allergic or nonallergic diseases or conditions such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis 31 cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis bee venom sensitivity anaphylaxis 32 idiopathic anaphylaxis eosinophilassociated gastrointestinal disorder bullous pemphigoid 33 interstitial cystitis 34 nasal polyps and idiopathic angiodema  35 the generally positive results have suggested that ig e possibly plays a key role either directly or indirectly in these diseases and therefore intervening the ig e pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy the results of some of these case studies and pilot studies have subsequently persuaded the drug companies marketing omalizumab to carry out largerscale trials on some of the diseases roles in nonallergic diseases  editseveral groups have reported clinical trial results that omalizumab may be effective in patients with nonallergic asthma 36 this seems to be contrary to the general understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of the antiig e therapy discussed above 37 furthermore among the diseases in which omalizumab has been studied for efficacy and safety some are not allergic diseases because hypersensitivity reactions toward external antigens is not involved for example a portion of the cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria 38 39 and all cases of bullous pemphigoid 33 are clearly autoimmune diseases for the remaining cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria and those of the different subtypes of physical urticaria the internal abnormalities leading to the disease manifestation have not been identified notwithstanding these developments it is apparent that many of those diseases involve inflammatory reactions in the skin and the activation of mast cells an increasing series of papers have shown that ig e potentiates the activities of mast cells 40 and omalizumab can function as a mast cellstabilizing agent 24 rendering these inflammatory cells to be less active history  edittanox a biopharmaceutical company based in houston texas started the antiig e program created antibody drug candidates and filed its first patent application on the antiig e therapeutic approach in 1987 41 in the next year the company converted one candidate antibody to a chimeric antibody which was later named cgp51901 and further developed into a humanized antibody tnx901 or talizumab  the antiig e therapeutic concept was not well received in the early period of the program in order to seek funding for the antiig e program the two scientist founders of tanox nancy t chang and tse wen chang visited about 25 pharmaceutical and larger biotech companies in the u s canada europe japan and other countries to discuss collaboration throughout 1989 representatives of cibageigy which merged with sandoz to form novartis in 1996 thought the antiig e program scientifically interesting and executives from tanox and cibageigy signed a collaborative agreement in 1990 to develop the antiig e program 41 42in 1991 after several rounds of preind  investigational new drug  meetings with officialsscientists of the fda the fda finally gave a nod for cgp51901 to be tested in human subjects this approval of ind for an antiig e antibody for the first time was regarded a brave demonstration of professionalism for both the fda officials and the tanoxcibageigy team the scientists participating in the preind discussion comprehended that an ordinary antiig e antibody ie one without the set of binding specificity of cgp51901 would invariably activate mast cells and basophils and cause anaphylactic shocks and probably deaths among injected persons notwithstanding this concern they came to the same view that based on the presented scientific data cgp51901 should have an absolutely required clean distinction from an ordinary antiig e antibody in this regard 43 44 in 19911993 researchers from cibageigy and tanox and a leading clinical research group headed by stephen holgate in the asthmaallergy field ran a successful phase i human clinical trial of cgp51901 in southampton england and showed that the tested antibody is safe 45 in 19941995 the tanoxcibageigy team conducted a phase ii trial of cgp51901 in patients with severe allergic rhinitis in texas and showed that cgp51901 is safe and efficacious in relieving allergic symptoms 46while the tanoxcibageigy antiig e program was gaining momentum genentech announced in 1993 that it also had an antiig e program for developing antibody therapeutics for asthma and other allergic diseases scientists in genentech had made a mouse antiig e monoclonal antibody with the binding specificity similar to that of cgp51901 and subsequently humanized the antibody the antibody was later named omalizumab 47 this caused great concerns in tanox because it had disclosed its antiig e technology and sent its antiig e antibody candidate which was to become cgp51901 and tnx901 to genentech in 1989 for the latter to evaluate for the purpose of considering establishing a corporate partnership 48 having failed to receive reconciliation from genentech tanox filed a lawsuit against genentech for trade secret violation 48 coincidentally tanox started to receive major patents for its antiig e invention from the european union and from the u s in 1995 49 after a 3year legal entanglement genentech and tanox settled their lawsuits outofcourt and tanox novartis and genentech formed a tripartite partnership to jointly develop the antiig e program in 1996 50 omalizumab became the drug of choice for further development because it had a better developed manufacturing process than tnx901 50 a large number of corporatesponsored clinical trials and physicianinitiated case series studies on omalizumab have been planned and performed since 1996 and a large number of research reports especially those of clinical trial results have been published since around 2000 as described and referenced in other sections of this article in 2007 genetech bought tanox at 20share for approximately 900 million 51 52dosing and administration  editxolair omalizumab package with powder and solvent phials omalizumab is administered subcutaneously once every 2 or 4 weeks for each patient the dosing schedule 2 vs 4 weeks between injections and the amount of omalizumab in milligrams for each injection is determined according to the serum ig e level and the body weight of the patient 53 the underlying rationale is that the ig e present at the time of the first injection and produced during the intervals of successive injections must all be neutralized by omalizumab the product label of xolair initially approved by fda covers patients with serum ig e in the range of 30 to about 700 iuml international units per milliliter 54 a clinical development effort is ongoing to expand the coverage of patients with serum ig e up to 1500 iuml 55as of may 10 2008 the company began requiring that the drug be administered by a patients health care provider due to a risk of anaphylaxis previously the drug could be selfadministered omalizumab was for several years provided only in a dry powder formulation which requires the reconstitution with a prepacked solvent with the help of a shaker at the treating clinician’s office before injection a prefilled syringe liquid formulation has become available in many countries 56for the administration in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria or chronic idiopathic urticaria the dosage is uniform 300 mg per four weeks subcutaneous regardless of serum ig e levels and body weight 57manufacturing  editomalizumab is a glycosylated ig g1 monoclonal antibody produced by cells of an adapted chinese hamster ovary cho cell line 2 the antibody molecules are secreted by the host cells in a cell culture process employing largescale bioreactors at the end of culturing the ig g contained in the medium is purified by an affinitycolumn using protein a as the adsorbent followed by chromatography steps and finally concentrated by ufdf paired ultra filtrationdepth filtration currently omalizumab is manufactured at the novartis huningue manufacturing site france 58 through a partnership agreement with genentech research  editthe drug is being actively studied for various allergic diseases eg peanut allergy 59 and some nonallergic diseases especially skin diseases the tested indications are in the areas of allergic asthma perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis 60 61 peanut allergy 62latex allergy 63 atopic dermatitis 64 65 chronic idiopathic urticaria also called chronic spontaneous urticaria 66 67idiopathic anaphylaxis 68 mastocytosis 69 eosinophilic gastroenteritis nasal polyposis 70 and others some of those diseases are not caused by allergens and are generally not considered to be allergic diseases clinical trials in 2013 indicate that omalizumab is effective in patients with recalcitrant antihistamine resistant chronic idiopathic urticaria including those cases of autoimmune cause 38 39 71 omalizumab has also been studied in combination with allergenbased specific immunotherapy  allergy shots for the purpose of reducing anaphylactic reactions when receiving allergen immunizations and of accelerating immunization schedule and dosing so as to achieve therapeutic effects in shorter treatment periods and in broader patient populations 72 73 74in august 2013 a researcher at leiden university medical center responsible for the tiger trial was fired for unrelated research fraud the tiger trial was halted as a result 75references  edit schulman es october 2001 development of a monoclonal antiimmunoglobulin e antibody omalizumab for the treatment
