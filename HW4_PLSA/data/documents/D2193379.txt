background fairy people origin of the faeries types of fairies origin of the faeries fairy comes from the old french word faerie the word has been overused to describe a supernatural being there is a great deal of difference in classifying a being as a fairy from the medieval literature and those from modern literature especially those belonging to the celtic tradition there are other traditions such as that found in english german and slavic folklores today when we think of fairies we often visualise them as tiny supernatural beings with wings and glowing with uncommon light in todays children fairy tales and they also possessed some sorts of strange magical powers like tinklebell in the story of peter pan or the fairy godmother in cinderella the modern fairies between the 18th and 20th century comes from oral tradition before they were transmitted into writing the fairies are supernatural beings that can be best described by the greek word  daimon which means spirit they are not divinity ie god or goddess in the usual sense of the word and yet they are not mere mortal often it is easier to classify them as minor divinity however if we look at the idea of fairies then you would find that have been around a lot longer than everyone expects perhaps the earliest form of faeries can be found loosely in the mythical beings in greek mythology such as the nymphs satyrs and sileni the nymphs from ancient greek myths can be considered as fairies and they existed as early as the time of homer writing the iliad and the odyssey even the river gods in greek myths can be classified as fairies these are spirits or minor deities of nature or of the natural phenomena and then there are household or guardian spirits that can be found in roman religion and mythology such as the penates lares and genii the norse versions of the fairies are the wide variety of elves and the dísir that exist in the teutonic traditions the valkyries could also be classified as fairies it was during the time of queen elizabeth i of england where william shakespeare 15641616 had popularised fairies in english folklore in his play midsummer nights dream with the characters oberon titania and puck robin goodfellow earlier than shakespeare chaucer 13421400 mentioned that the land of britain was filled with fairies before the time of king arthur in the arthurian legends the divine or fairy figures also appeared in abundance morgan arthurs halfsister seemed to be great sorceress and healer was often called morgan le fay her nickname fay which means fairy and then there is this lady of the lake arthurs wife guinevere or gwenhwyfar in the welsh tradition also appeared to be a fairy as well as the sovereignty goddess many knights were either born from fairies or they took female fairies as their lovers even merlin was only part mortal then you would discover that that these images of fairies are not the only kind there were all sorts in fairy tales and folklores some are benign while others are maligned and hostile to mortals some were seen as fair while others were considered ugly and monstrous to look at they can come in all size and sizes  tall or short fat or skinny so there is really no clear definition of fairies may look like different types of fairies may also have different types of magical powers so what are these fairies where do they come from to understand what they are we should look at some of those found in celtic mythology and other celtic traditions but then you would discover that fairies are not just confined in celtic traditions many cultures and civilizations have their own versions of fairies there are enough kinds of fairies to confuse anyone because sometimes writers have associated one fairy with a different kind in celtic religion there was celtic deities in gaul france and belgium hispania spain and britannia britain during the roman occupation of these regions or provinces but the situation changed when christianity spread to the west and north these deities that were worshipped before the conversion to christianity were reduced to the status of fairies in celtic mythology and folklore so in ireland the gods in the tuatha de danann were degenerated to the roles of fairies eg dagda and lugh people living under the dune mound or fabled islands or even within underwater domains similar degeneration occurred with old deities in wales scotland and other surviving pockets of celtic kingdoms such as cornwall brittany and island of man these earlier celtic traditions of fairies the former irish or welsh deities were also not fairies in the usual sense they looked very much like human in size and shape except that they have special magical powers and they seemed eternally young but they dont have wings the dananns or their welsh counterparts were usually seen as race of fair people they can die just as mortals can but their lives could last hundreds or even thousands of years the problem is that sometimes the christian authors have also turned them into beings serving the devil and that the fairies were actually demons however this view is no longer shared today these medieval fairies are different from the common folklore and fairy tales of today the tuatha de danann is nothing like the brownie leprechaun and goblin of these later traditions related information name faerie færie

century poet williams butler yeats he wrote two works which is of interests the celtic twilight 1893 1902fairy and folk tales of the irish peasantry 1888in fairy and folk tales of the irish peasantry is not only description of fairies it is a collection of works poems and prose from other authors such as t crofton croker and lady wilde in this work he divided the fairies into two broad categories trooping fairies or social fairies solitary fairies social or trooping fairies are those who lived in large company like in a clan the tuatha de danann who lived in the sidh ruled by a king and sometimes a queen or both can be considered as the social fairies they were often seen feasting singing and dancing they can be either benevolent or hostile to humans another example of trooping fairies is the merrow the solitary fairy usually avoid large gathering there are many types of solitary fairy such as banshee leprechaun cluricaune brownie pooka etc generally they can recognise by the type of jackets they wore the social fairies wore green jackets while the solitary fairies wore red ones but sometimes their jackets are brown or grey scottish fairy folklore can also be divided in the similar fashion of solitary and social fairies another writer wirt sikes wrote in the british goblins 1880 comparing the welsh fairies with that of norseteutonic fairies sikes says that there are four types in the norse tradition 1 elves 2 dwarves and troll 3 nisses and 4 necks mermen and mermaids while in the welsh traditions there arethe ellyllon or the elvesthe coblynau or the mine fairiesthe bwbachod or the household fairiesthe gwragedd annwn or the fairies of the lakes and streamsthe gwyllion or the mountain fairies here the classification of welsh fairies distinguished household fairies from that of the mines lakes and mountains like the irish tradition the welsh can be further divided into solitary and social fairies the welsh name use for fairies is y tylwyth teg which mean the fair folk and these folk lived in gwlad y tylwyth teg fairyland related information name solitary fairy social fairies trooping fairies sources fairy and folk tales of the irish peasantry 1888 and the celtic twilight 1893 were written and edited by william butler yeats british goblins was written by wirt sikes 1880 here are the list and descriptions of faeries since there are many types of faeries there will only be articles on faeries that have parallel to or has antecedents from the mythical beings of the celtic mythology so there wont be many faeries that are found in this page about fairies eg pixie and goblins that appear in later folklore i will also concentrate mainly in the celtic regions eg britain ireland and brittany ignoring germanic and slavic faeries

woman of fairy mound or just simply as fairy woman ban or bean meaning woman the various spelling or pronounciation of the word for fairy mound referred to the otherworldly realm which the irish referred to as shee sid sidh or sidhe the word banshee may have originated from east munster and there are many ways it can be spelt in irish gaelic it could be spelt as banshie bean sidhe and ben side the scottish words are bansith beanshith and bean sith the manx form is ben shee it was only in later irish and scottish gaelic folklore traditions that banshee came to mean a female wraith or spirit whose keening presages the death of persons in the household this banshee was tied to a person or family sort of like an attendant fairy she only foretells the pending death of a person unlike the breton fairy woman korrigan the banshee doesnt cause a persons death with her power or curse related to the banshee is the washer or washerwoman at the ford known in scottish folklore as bean sighe according to the irish poet yeats banshee was sometimes accompanied by the dullahan a headless fairy coachman it is also sometimes believed that on these occasion the banshee is also headless it has been reported in 1807 that one headless banshee had frightened to death two sentries stationed at james park the banshee was sometimes seen as a young fair woman especially in irish texts while other sources from scottish tradition described her as an old hag her description varied what is common in both traditions was that banshee had long unbound hair and dressed in white though sometimes she was seen dressed in a grey cloak over a green dress another common tradition is that she can be heard weeping or wailing that sounds like the keening of mourners and because of continuous weeping her eyes were red in colour in 1987 patrica lysaght claimed that the closest anticipation of the banshee found in old irish mythology was fedelm the seeress in the táin bó cuailnge ulster cycle there

of this female wraith earlier irish and welsh legends the washer at the ford only bore superficial resemblance to the scottish bean nighe the earlier washing women in early irish and welsh traditions were goddesses and bean nighe were probably derived from these figures these antecedent of the bean nighe are the irish goddess morrigan and the welsh goddess modron in the irish myth dagda met such woman washing at the ford of the river unshin near glenn etin on samhain night this lovely woman was beautiful this was not presaging of dagdas doom dagda slept with her and she offered to aid him in the coming battle though the name of this woman was not given she was most likely to be morrigan or badb here she foretold the defeat of the fomorians but that was not only the purpose of morrigan morrigan represented the sovereignty of ireland for ireland to enjoy its wealth and fertility it required a king to have sex with the sovereignty goddess or lady of ireland for ireland to renew its prosperity and the fertility of the land dagda was required to sleep with morrigan each year on samhain night see wedded to the land in celtic world in welsh tradition this washer was modron the great

elves were later given in germanic and celtic folklore traditions the closest thing that the celtic people had to the elves were the ellyll from welsh tradition they were short or tiny and can be seen as benevolent if pleased so they would care for the house doing chores in the night if they were offended they can become malevolent disrupting the household by breaking dishes spilling milk keeping

most common female fairies in the breton tradition are the korrigans that resided in the woods especially at broceliande often near a stream spring or fountain she was fairy that seeks a mortal lover the korrigan seemed to be breton version of the banshee the korrigan was probably a pagan druidess originally she was equated with gwragedd annwn – the welsh fairies of the lake and streams she tried to seduce mortal who would drink from her water she would lure him to sleep with her if the man refused her advance or seduction she would angrily curse him to a doom this is what happened to the seigneur of nann the seigneur was married to a woman whom he loved one day his wife asked for some mayblossoms from the forest the seigneur rode out but during his ride he became thirsty and drank the water from a fountain here the seigneur encountered the korrigan who demanded that he sleep with her but the seigneur angrily refused because he was faithful to his wife and rode away after hearing that he would die in three days the moment the seigneur rode back to his castle he went immediately to the church instead of back to his wife the priest his mother and other people kept the secret of his fate from his wife three days later the seigneurs mother finally told her daughterinlaw the truth the wife died of broken heart and was buried beside the seigneur in breton folklore she was the most likely suspect in the abduction of mortal infants as fostermother of the baby she would raise it as if the child was her own the korrigan has been compared to several figures in mythology and legend these were most likely antecedents of the korrigan one of them is the welsh goddess ceridwen or keridwen she was wife of the giant tegid foel and reside lake tegid there are two other notable antecedents to the korrigan but within the arthurian legend where they reside either near a fountain or within the lake itself at broceliande they are the countess or lady of the fountain and the lady of the lake the korrigan was sort of like the lady of the fountain in the legend of welsh owain or french yvain though the welsh version in the mabinogion doesnt disclose the name of forest or the fountain chretien de troyes had located fountain in the forest of broceliande owain or yvain actually married the lady of the fountain after slaying her husband though the hero wasnt doomed to die he lost his wit because a damsel removed the wedding ring from his finger because he forgot to return to his wife after one years sojourn in king arthurs court he roamed the forest as a naked wild man eventually his wits was restored and he was reunited with his wife after many heroic adventures the lady of the fountain didnt seem to have any special power like korrigan but she was lady of otherworldly castle and her fountain have strange power over the weather see yvain and the lady of the fountain the lady of the lake is known by several names  niniane viviane vivian vivien eviene and nimue whatever her original name was by the time of chretien de troyes died in c 1185 she was seen more of a fairy than a goddess the lady of the lake exhibited the closest characteristics to the korrigan but the lady was more benevolent than the korrigans the lady of the lake was responsible for giving the sword exicalibur to king arthur see legend of excalibur new sword  she abducted the infant from queen elaine or helen of banoic and raised the infant lancelot to manhood she was lancelots tutor see lancelot  but most interesting is the lady of the lake connection with merlin arthurs wizard and counsellor merlin was infatuated with the lovely lady of the lake though merlin was gifted with divination he was helpless to prevent his doom he taught her all his skill in magic in the hope of winning her love which included hiding her palace and domain either under the lake or in illusionary lake but lady of the lake had no intention of sleeping with the wizard and she used the last magic he had taught her to confine or entomb merlin in or under the large stone see legend of excalibur death of merlin  both the lady of the fountain and the lady of the lake were thought to be originally goddesses of the water and due to the connection of these lady to a bodies of water within the forest of broceliande there is a striking resemblance to the korrigans related information
