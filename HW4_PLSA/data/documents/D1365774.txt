ordered was delivered on time i dont know about others but to my experiences all goods ordered were delivered on time c pc2 reviews reviewed on wed 21032018  0738a flashy webstore supported by a bunch of clowns their flashy web store offers a lot of promises but wait till you have checked out and made the payment your problem has just been unleashed and welcome to the real lazada malaysia you soon receive a confirmed order email from them but followed by yet another email telling you that your paid and confirmed order has just been cancelled by lazada because of system error next you are informed that your refund will be on its way within 24 hours but they dont tell you that they work only 8 hours a day three days later they email you telling you that they are working round the clock to provide your refund but they dont seem to have your bank details once you have sent them the details you instead get an email informing you that your refund voucher code has arrived so you wont be getting your cash back now you have 365days to utilise it for another lazada online purchase and the cycle soon repeats itself the worst thing is when you have uses the refund voucher and topped it up with additional cash you face another problem this time around you get a refund voucher for only the cash portion you have topped up as to the original refund voucher value they have forfeited it so shop at your perilpl cheang1 review reviewed on wed 21032018  0106gte is lazada worst supplier i bought a faulty product with warranty period of 1 month as stated in the product details i contacted the supplier for exchange but has been ignored then i returned the faulty product within a week to lazada for refund lazada confirmed back the item was indeed faulty but not willing to pay for the refund they just simply said my return was rejected and sent back the faulty product to me again dont ever trust lazada do provide any warranty as stated in the product details especially gte supplier

providing an avenue for consumers in malaysia to shop online lazada is not doing enough to vouch for its merchants for selling fake items and inferior ones the delivery experience of the products has certainly improved but i am still hearing about lost items and super late delivery of items because itâ€™s using the services of skynet returning of items is still a very difficult and troublesome process seng giap ang1 review reviewed on sat 20012018  0845terrible system their whole system is f funny 1st in customer service you type all your information in it and the f system is useless where
