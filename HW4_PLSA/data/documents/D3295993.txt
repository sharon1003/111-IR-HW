decided to exclude inventory measured using the lastin firstout lifo and retail inventory methods from the scope of the proposed changes there is no change to the accounting for inventory measured using the lifo or retail inventory methods lower of cost and net realizable value the board affirmed its proposal to require that inventory within the scope of the amendments be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value as a result a reporting entity would no longer be required to consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory within the scope of the amendments method of transition and disclosures in the period of transition the board affirmed its proposal that entities should apply the amendments prospectively and disclose in the period of adoption the nature of and reason for the accounting change disclosures the board affirmed that the amendments would not require additional disclosures in periods after the amendments are adopted effective date the board decided that public business entities would be required to apply the amendments in annual reporting periods beginning after december

annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 the board decided to allow all entities the option of early adopting the changes as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period permission to ballot the board decided that it has received sufficient information and analysis on the proposed amendments to make an informed decision on the issues presented and that the expected benefits of those amendments justify the perceived cost of change the board directed the staff to draft a final update for vote by written ballot tentative board decisions reached to date measurement the board decided that inventory would be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value a reporting entity would no longer consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory recurring disclosure the board decided not to add

simplification initiative is to identify evaluate and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles gaap for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information required to be reported by an entity the board has heard from stakeholders that the guidance on the measurement of inventory is unnecessarily complex because there are several potential outcomes topic 330 inventory currently requires a reporting entity to measure inventory at lower of cost or market market could be replacement cost net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin in order to reduce complexity of measuring inventory the board has decided to implement a lower of cost or net realizable value model for inventory measured using methods other than lifo or the retail inventory method which more closely aligns with international financial reporting standards  contact information christopher brown postgraduate
