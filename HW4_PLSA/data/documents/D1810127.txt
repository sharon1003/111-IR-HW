we have more than enough evidence now to conclusively show that the normal range is between 58 and 60 sitting and 7274 standing anything outside of that range is certainly inhuman probably a hybrid of

puts on his doctor suit it is normal for heart rate to increase when you rise from sitting or lying position to standing when youre lying or sitting down the blood in your body is distributed by gravity so when you stand up the blood tends to pool in your legs causing your blood pressure to drop this is what fighter pilots experience with highg load if the pressure falls enough you black out your heart attempts to compensate for this by increasing its output via an increase in heart rate so faster heart ratehigher cardiac outputmore blood to the brain a good thing a rise of less than 20 beats per minute is considered normal some say 25 you can also measure your blood pressure lyingstanding the pressure will fall a drop of less than 20 is considered normal and one would expect that

27joined april 19 2005wouldnt the work done by the muscles during the act of standing up increase the heart rate somewhat id guess youd have to remain standing and wait a while dont measure the heart rate for a minute or however long it takes to slow the heart to slow back down im not saying it wont be higher but to measure it immediately after standing up is probably not apples to apples sorry applegeorge k aug 20 2006 0547 am post 13finally posts 87056group members member 249joined august 4 2005quote wouldnt the work done by the muscles during the act of standing up increase the heart rate somewhat no because blood flow to muscle is determined by the work that muscle is doing standing up happens so quickly that the metabolic changes required to increase blood flow dont have time to occur whereas the rapid fall in blood pressure triggers almost instanateous reflexes to increase heart rate your body doesnt even have time to squeeze the blood vessels to increase blood pressure an increase in heart rate is the first response to a fall of blood pressure and thats what you feel quote id guess youd have to remain standing and wait a while after a while your blood vessels constrict to increase blood pressure and your heart rate will fall to its previous levels give or take a bit a guide to gksr clicknow look here you baltic gas passer   mik 61408nothing is as effective as
