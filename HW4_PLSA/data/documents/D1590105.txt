raids on transjordan were a series of plunders by the ikhwan irregular arab tribesmen of najd on transjordan between 1922 and 1924 though the raids were not orchestrated by ibn saud the ruler of nejd nothing was done by him to stop the raiding parties of his ally ikhwanis this however changed after the conquest of hejaz when the increasingly critical and negative stance of ibn saud on ikhwan raids developed into an open feud and essentially a bloody conflict since 1927 in early 1920s the repeated wahhabi incursions of ikhwan from najd into southern parts of his territory were the most serious threat to emir abdullah s position in transjordan 24 the emir was powerless to repel those raids by himself thus the british maintained a military base with a small air force at marka close to amman

the north  where the ikhwan raided in 1922 and 1924 the few areas of central arabia that hadnt been overrun by the saudiikhwan forces had treaties with britain and abdul aziz was sober enough to realize the folly of a potential conflict with the british however the ikhwan had been taught that all nonwahhabis were infidels faisal aldawish of the mutair tribe and sultan bin bajad of the otaiba tribe the leaders of the ikhwan were among those who accused abdul aziz of going soft with the former reportedly telling the latter that the saudis were as much use as camel bags without handles a rebellion erupted climaxing in a battle at sabillah which some have labeled a massacre but prosaudi sources consider to have been a fair fight 25 additional battles erupted through 1929 in jabal shammar and in the vicinity of the awazim tribe the rebellion was put down in 1930 with the surrender of last opposition elements though the survivors were jailed their descendants remained opposed to

under imam muhammad bin yahya hamid addin and his descendants the yemenis claimed parts of asir and came to blows with the saudis in 1933 writing in the american journal foreign affairs in 1934 historian hans kohn noted some european observers have wished to explain the armed conflict as a conflict between british and italian policy in arabia despite british ties to saudi arabia and italian ties to yemen he concluded that the rivalry between the two rulers is in no way caused or fostered by the rivalry of the two european states 29 however in 1998 alexei vassiliev wrote the imam was instigated both by the italians who promoted assistance in order to increase their influence in yemen and by the british who wished to detract imam yahyas attention from their protectorates in aden  30 the saudis struck back reaching the yemeni port of al hudaydah before signing a treaty of muslim friendship and arab brotherhood in taif which was published simultaneously in mecca sanaa damascus and cairo to highlight its panarabism 31 32remarking on the implications of the treaty which stated that the two parties nations are one and agree to consider each others interests their own kohn wrote the foreign policy of both kingdoms will be brought into line and harmonized so that both countries will act as one country in foreign affairs practically it will mean a protectorate over the yemen by ibn saud the stronger and much more progressive partner 32 relations indeed remained close until civil war erupted in yemen in the 1960s at which time the country became a staging ground for

folklore he compares to the storming of the bastille ibn saud himself told numerous versions over the years which is only partly attributable to ibn sauds excitability according to lacey he was spinning history in the way that the old testament scribes spun their legends or the creator of the chanson de roland wove his epic for even today it remains the pleasant obstinacy of the arab to be
