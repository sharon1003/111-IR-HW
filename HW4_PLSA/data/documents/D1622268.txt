prostate mriwhat is prostate mri mri or magnetic resonance imaging represents one of the greatest advances of modern medicine this powerful yet noninvasive imaging procedure has no radiation exposure to the patient mri is used to see internal structures and function in the human body and all of its organs mri shows greater detail among soft tissues than computed tomography ct scans and has many advanced applications in musculoskeletal neurological and oncological cancer imaging highresolution prostate mri imaging utilizes advanced computerassisted detection cad hardware and software in conjunction with highfield mri to analyze the kinetics of blood flow through the prostate this results in higher sensitivity for detection of abnormal sites of blood flow that may represent the sites of cancer within the prostate gland the superior resolution offered by mri can enable physicians to determine cancer stage conclude whether the cancer is contained within the gland or has spread and help determine the most appropriate treatment path for the patient your physician in conjunction with the radiologists of atlantic medical imaging may choose to add prostate mri to the imaging procedures used to diagnose rule out or follow the treatment of prostate cancer be assured that the technology and expertise used at ami is of the highest quality and truly stateoftheart this technology not only provides increased accuracy but also affords increased comfort for the patient during the exam your doctor might request an mri of the prostate gland for a number of reasons to show more clearly the extent of prostate cancer specifically to see if it is contained within the prostate gland or if it has spread outside the gland to help show if there is any evidence of cancer in the prostate gland if you have a high or rising prostatespecific antigen psa level psa is a substance that the prostate produces which can be measured in a blood sample it is usually raised when you have prostate cancer but can also be raised for other reasons for example if you have an infection of the prostate gland to help in planning radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer to find prostate cancer that has grown back after treatment mri is generally requested because it provides more detailed images of the prostate gland than other radiological tests such as computed tomography ct or ultrasound what should i expect during the exam as with most mri exams prostate mri is completely noninvasive and painless with the help of an mri technologist you will be positioned on a padded table a padded coil will be placed across the top of your abdomen and you will be moved slowly into the mri machine feet first your head will be out of the magnet you will have a small iv placed into a vein in either your arm or hand at a specific time during the exam the contrast material will be injected into your arm to further enhance the prostate mri images for your comfort you will be given ear plugs during the exam you will remain in contact with the technologist during the entire exam once the exam is complete you will be brought out of the magnet and assisted off the table by the technologist you can resume your normal activities your images will be sent to the computer enhanced analysis system for a radiologist to interpret and the written report of your results will be sent to your referring physician breast mribreast mri is a noninvasive procedure that radiologists can use to determine what the inside of the breast looks like no radioactivity is involved the test may be used to distinguish between benign not cancer and malignant lesions breast mri is an excellent problem solving technology and is often used to investigate breast concerns first detected with mammography physical exam or other imaging exams the breast mri should be scheduled in the middle of your menstrual cycle between the 7th and 14th day hormone therapy must be discontinued 3 weeks prior to the exam andor 68 weeks after lumpectomy body mriorgans of the chest abdomen and pelvis including the lungs liver kidney spleen pancreas abdominal vessels uterus ovaries and prostate glandcan be examined in high detail with mri enabling the diagnosis and evaluation of tumors and functional disorders mri is increasing in popularity as a problemsolving tool in the evaluation of breast disease and the early detection of breast cancer because no radiation exposure is involved mri is often the preferred diagnostic tool for examination of the male and female reproductive systems pelvis and hips and the bladder musculoskeletal mribecause mri provides such clear pictures of soft tissue structures it is usually the best choice for examination of the bodys major joints the spine and soft tissues of the extremities mri is widely used to diagnose disc disease and sportsrelated injuries as well as workrelated disorders and repetitive motion injuries using mri images physicians can locate and identify the cause of pain swelling or bleeding in the tissues in and around the joints and bones the images allow the physician to clearly see small tears and injuries to tendons ligaments muscles and cartilage and fractures that cannot be seen on routine xrays in addition mri images can give physicians a clear picture of degenerative disorders such as arthritis deterioration of joint surfaces and disc herniations neurosurgeons often use mri to evaluate the integrity of the spinal cord after trauma finally mri is also useful for the diagnosis and characterization of infections eg osteomyelitis and tumors eg metastases involving bones soft tissues and joints mri of the brain mri is the most sensitive exam for brain tumors strokes and certain chronic disorders of the nervous system such as multiple sclerosis in addition it is a useful means of documenting brain abnormalities in patients with dementia and it is commonly used for patients with disease of the pituitary gland mri can detect tiny areas of tissue abnormality in patients with disease of the eyes or the inner ear mr angiography blood vesselsmany patients with arterial disease are now treated in outpatient radiology centers rather than undergoing surgery in an operating room mra is a very useful way to detect problems with blood vessels and is an aid in determining how to best treat those problems the carotid arteries in the neck which are the blood vessels that carry blood to the brain are a common site of atherosclerosis which may severely narrow or block off an artery reducing blood flow to the brain and even causing a stroke if an ultrasound study shows that such disease is present many surgeons will now do the necessary operation after confirmation by mra dispensing with the need for catheter angiography mra has also found wide use in evaluating patients for disease in the arteries of the brain so that only those with positive findings will need to have a more invasive catheter study mra also is used to detect disease in the aorta and in blood vessels supplying the kidneys lungs and legs patients with a family history of aneurysm a ballooning out of a segment of the vessel wall can be screened by mra to detect an aneurysm that has not produced symptoms if an aneurysm is found it may be treated surgically possibly avoiding serious or fatal bleeding
