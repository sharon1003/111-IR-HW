brand and generic names for ppis what are proton pump inhibitors ppis and how do they work mechanism of action proton pump inhibitors ppis reduce the production of acid by blocking the enzyme in the wall of the stomach that produces acid acid is necessary for the formation of most ulcers in the esophagus stomach and duodenum and the reduction of acid with ppis prevents ulcers and allows any

differ in how they are brokendown by the liver and their drug interactions the effects of some ppis may last longer therefore they may be taken less frequently what are the side effects of proton pump inhibitors ppis the most common side effects of proton pump inhibitors are headache diarrhea constipation abdominal pain flatulence fever vomiting nausea rash nevertheless proton pump inhibitors generally are well tolerated ppis may increase the risk of clostridium difficile infection of the colon high doses and longterm use 1 year or longer may increase the risk of osteoporosis related fractures of the hip wrist or spine prolonged use also reduces absorption of vitamin b12  cyanocobalamin  longterm use of ppis has also been associated with low levels of magnesium hypomagnesemia analysis of patients taking ppis for long periods of time showed an increased risk of heart attacks therefore it is important to use the lowest doses and shortest duration of treatment necessary for the condition being treated other serious side effects associate with ppis include serious allergic reactions stevensjohnson syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis reduced kidney function pancreatitis reduced liver function erythema multiforme quick guide heartburn foods to eat foods to avoid what drugs interact with proton pump inhibitors ppis proton pump inhibitors interact with few drugs the absorption into the body of some drugs is affected by the presence of acid in the stomach and because ppis reduce acid in the stomach they may affect the absorption of these drugs specifically ppis reduce the absorption and concentration in the blood of ketoconazole  nizoral and increase the absorption and concentration of digoxin  lanoxin  this may lead to reduced effectiveness of ketoconazole and an increase in digoxin toxicity proton pump inhibitors can reduce the breakdown of some drugs by the liver and lead to an increase in their concentration in the blood omeprazole  prilosec is more likely than the other ppis to reduce the breakdown of drugs by the liver for example omeprazole prilosec may increase the concentration in the blood of diazepam  valium  warfarin  coumadin and phenytoin  dilantin  omeprazole prilosec prilosec otc reduces the effect of clopidogrel  plavix by blocking the conversion of clopidogrel to its active form this combination should be avoided list of
