buyback or repair options as well as cash settlements expected to start this fall june 28 2016share facebook tweet pinterest email the 15 billion settlement between volkswagen and u s state and federal agencies announced today signaled the next step in the vw diesel crisis now 10 months old while the automaker has agreed to set aside a substantial sum to compensate the epa the california air resources board carb and others almost half a million tdi diesel volkswagen owners now want to know what vw will do with their cars the settlement has set aside 1003 billion to address the buyback and recall process for affected u s models this figure assumes 100 percent participation from owners of existing cars and that 100 percent of owners will elect to sell their cars back of approximately 499000 20l tdl vehicles that were produced for sale in the united states approximately 460000 volkswagen and 15000 audi vehicles are currently in use and eligible for buybacks and lease terminations or emissions modifications if approved by regulators volkswagen said in a statement vehicles eligible for the settlement program include the following2013  2015 vw beetle2010  2015 vw golf2009  2015 vw jetta2012  2015 vw passat2010  2013 2015 audi a3vw diesel scandal vw on the hook for 15 billion diesel settlement report says owners of affected vw diesel vehicles can choose to sell their cars back to volkswagen or to terminate their leases without the monetary penalty typically associated with lease termination alternatively owners will be able to have their vehicles repaired by vw and keep them regardless of option owners will also be offered a cash settlement from volkswagen now estimated to be between 5100 and 10000 depending on the vehicle and other factors those details are expected to be published on july 26 following a fourweek commenting period that will determine the compensation scale for payments on top of the vehicle value those who elect to sell their cars back to vw will have their vehicles value determined by the clean tradein value as it was cited in the september 2015 edition of the nada used car guide before the diesel crisis erupted the values will be adjusted for mileage and options in the vehicles the repairandkeep option is still subject to a future approval by u s regulators which is why the 1003 billion allocation assumes a 100 percent buyback rate for the remaining volkswagen and audi vehicles for now volkswagen has not said whether repaired vehicles will maintain their fuel economy and performance characteristics experts expect that the vehicles will suffer some degree of loss when it comes to those two factors the settlement still assumes that volkswagen will remove at least 85 percent of the affected tdi models through this program so the repair option once ratified by the respective authorities is not expected to represent the overwhelming outcome for the 20liter diesel models vw diesel scandal vw investors tired of stonewalling demand independent diesel investigation the buyback or repair program is expected to run for three years the automaker will have to pay additional funds to the environmental mitigation trust if it lags behind on removing 85 percent of the affected vehicles from the road volkswagen will not be allowed to resell the vehicles it buys back and it is likely they will be scrapped as transportation to another market is too expensive one of the major questions that remains unanswered for now is just how many different models volkswagen will be able to repair and will be allowed to repair this may not be known for months as vw presents its repair plans to the epa and carb volkswagen is expected to start contacting tdi owners about their options as well as settlement offers after the july 26 finalization of the agreement buybacks of vehicles are expected to start as early as this fall while the repair option is expected to be offered later the automaker is expected to address the emissions issue affecting some 85000 30liter vw audi and porsche models separately we take our commitment to make things right very seriously and believe these agreements are a significant step
