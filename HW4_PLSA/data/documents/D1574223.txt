chronic pain relapsingremitting disorders by erica jacques updated december 18 2017share pin email print what are the types of relapsingremitting disease and how can you cope paul bradburyojo imagesgetty images your doctor may have mentioned that the condition youve been diagnosed with—such as multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disease s—has a relapsing and remitting pattern what does that mean and what should you know as you seek out a support system to help you cope with your condition definition a relapsingremitting disorder means the symptoms are at times worse relapse and other times are improved or gone remitting during a chronic pain relapse the pain would be present partially or completely during a remission however the pain would subside and require little if any treatment relapsing and remitting conditions may follow certain patterns or they may stop and start with seemingly no rhyme or reason some remissions are exacerbated by additional injuries or other factors because disease symptoms come and go in relapsingremitting disorders sufferers can often be lulled into a false belief that they are cured of their illness when in fact they are only in remission three types of relapsingremitting diseases there are actually several different types of relapsingremitting diseases which can be illustrated with three conditions in particular relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis rrms roughly 85 percent of people with multiple sclerosis initially have what is considered relapsingremitting disease because they often have both active phases and inactive phases commonly known as relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis rrms this autoimmune disease often has worsening inflammation attacks that impact neurologic function the relapses are often followed by remission periods during which time symptoms improve common symptoms of rrms are vision problems bowel and bladder problems fatigue numbness stiffness and problems with memory or information processing eventually many of these people will evolve to having secondarily progressive multiple sclerosis in which there is a progression of symptoms but fewer or no relapses rheumatoid arthritis ra is another autoimmune disease that often is classified as a relapsingremitting disorder rheumatoid arthritis which causes the immune system to attack parts of the body affects tissue in the joints these attacks cause episodes of inflammation that can result in stiffness and severe pain and can cause longterm and progressive damage to the joints inflammation symptoms of ra can include fever sweats weight loss and fatigue there are various classes of medications that can put the disease into remission for extended periods of time depending on the severity of the disease systemic lupus erythematosus  sle  an autoimmune disease also often follows a remitting and relapsing course systemic lupus erythematosus is more common in women than men and can strike at any age races most affected by this disease are african americans and asians episodic symptoms of lupus include severe fatigue joint pain swelling mouth sores hair loss fever general discomfort sensitivity to sunlight skin rash and swollen lymph nodes some people with sle also develop arthritis and the joints of the fingers hands wrists and knees are often affected other sle symptoms depend on the part of the body sle attacks for example the heart the lungs the skin the kidneys or other organs while there is no cure for sle the goal is to control the symptoms that can come in a remitting and relapsing pattern coping with relapses coping with a relapsing and remitting disease is very difficult we are creatures of habit and can adjust fairly well to a condition which occurs but follows a predictable pattern the element of surprise however in a relapsingremitting condition catches you offbalance and unprepared just as other surprises in our lives good or bad when this happens recurrently you may begin to distrust your body a bad feeling in addition to feeling offbalance these relapses and remissions can make you angry—and for good reason these conditions dont follow the rules and they dont play fair it can be frustrating especially when your symptoms recur when youre doing everything right or remit when youre doing everything wrong since anger with multiple sclerosis can be caused by changes in the brain as well the relapsing and remitting aspect of the disease can—to use an old adage—add fuel to the fire autoimmune diseases can produce in your mind a deep feeling of insecurity the only thing that doesnt appear to change is that change is inevitable even when you expect to have relapses—when youve been told and read that they do occur—it can still be a shock when your symptoms come back this can be even harder if your symptoms have been in remission for some time some people find it even more difficult to cope with a relapse of symptoms than with the initial diagnosis of their condition its similar for people who have an initial diagnosis of cancer and later have a recurrence when you are first diagnosed you are often surrounded by family and friends in comparison when you have a relapse your news is old news and doesnt often generate the same rush to help in addition a relapse is a slapintheface reminder that you really do have a disease if you are diagnosed and your symptoms abate on their own or with treatment your mind can easily be fooled that perhaps you are the exception unlike others your condition wont recur or maybe you were even given the wrong diagnosis in the first place a relapse is a notsosubtle reminder that you have a disease and it is not going to just go away in a way a relapsing disease is similar to bullying behavior in people though in this case the bully is a disease a bully may lead you to think that you are no longer a target and when he has regained your trust hits you even harder knocking you down such is what it can feel like when one of these conditions relapse coping with remissions what might surprise some people is that it can be as difficult to cope with remissions in a disease as with relapses have you ever caught yourself feeling anxious wondering when the next foot would drop a temporary or longer hiatus from a disease sometimes brings with it energy enough to really think about your disease when you are coping with a relapse you are focusing on getting through that stage of the process but when your condition remits youre left with time to think what is this disease doing to my life you may think that finding support or taking part in a support group would be most important when you are in the throes of a relapse but it can be just as important to seek support when you are in remission it is then that many of the questions come to mind—the questions that make you take stock of your life and it is often those who have coped with relapses and remissions themselves who can
