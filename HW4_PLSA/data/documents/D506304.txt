overview in bw cloyster received a gift it could only have dreamed of in previous generations shell smash with one of the best boosting moves around cloyster now finds itself being able to perform an entirely different role as a very threatening sweeper taking cloysters skill link ability into account it essentially has a 125 base power icicle spear and rock blast which at 2 attack will destroy anything that lacks a resistance to it or great bulk its watertype move of choice also makes sure that steeltypes arent surefire counters as a 2 stab hydro pump or razor shell will inflict huge damage to most of them however cloyster isnt without its flaws its ice typing leaves it with crippling weaknesses stealth rock and mach punch as well as only a neutrality to bullet punch with breloom and scizor being so prevalent vulnerability to priority is a major issue cloyster also has trouble getting past bulky watertypes such as jellicent and vaporeon which can burn or phaze it and thus prevent a sweep as well as keldeo one of the most threatening pokemon in the ou tier all in all cloyster takes some skill to use effectively but when set up it is extremely dangerous export shell smash move 1shell smash move 2icicle spear move 3rock blast move 4ice shard razor shell hydro pump item kings rock nevermelt ice ability skill link nature jolly naive evs4 hp 252 atk 252 spe cloysters main set is one that can sweep most teams with ease in fact its a liability to have a bulky groundtype when your opponent has a cloyster this set is best used on an offensive team where other sweepers can open up holes in defensive cores for cloyster to take advantage of shell smash doubles cloysters attack special attack and speed to threatening levels icicle spear is the perfect move for cloyster because of skill link it will always hit five times effectively making it a 125 base power stab move rock blast offers great coverage with icicle spear hitting fire water and icetypes for at least neutral damage in the last slot ice shard is preferred to prevent choice scarf latios and breloom from revenge killing cloyster as well as providing a useful priority check against landorust tornadus thundurust and dragontypes however you may also choose a watertype stab move to hit steeltypes among others hard after a shell smash razor shell ohkoes tyranitar and heatran without rain and scizor with rain after stealth rock damage razor shell also inflicts the most damage to specially defensive jirachi and it can wear down physically bulky opponents with its 50 chance to lower their defense by one stage hydro pump is the preferred option for getting past skarmory forretress and nonspecially defensive scizor since it hits their weaker special defense however it loses out on taking out specially defensive tyranitar and heatran with stealth rock support maximum speed investment allows cloyster to outspeed choice scarf latios with hidden power fire and the occasional modest venusaur in the sun among other things full investment in attack bolsters the power of icicle spear rock blast and razor shell greatly if cloyster is running hydro pump a naive nature should be used to boost speed while not detracting from hydro pumps power kings rock is the preferred item on this set as it takes advantage of the cloysters skill link ability best with this item icicle spear and rock blast attains a 41 flinch rate this item grants cloyster a high chance to double the damage output dealt by these moves via rendering the opponent immobile for a turn nevermelt ice is another worthy item if cloyster is running ice shard augmenting the power of its signature multihit and priority moves other alternative items include white herb to restore cloysters high defense cushioning it from priority attacks such as a brelooms mach punch and keldeos unboosted secret sword watch out for its stab hydro pump though focus sash allows cloyster to set up on even the most powerful of special attackers but due to the abundance of entry hazards sandstorm and priority focus sash is easily broken without proper rapid spin and weather support cloyster can usually find setup opportunities without the aid of focus sash as well life orb grants cloyster some notable kos after a shell smash such as on ferrothorn with icicle spear and bulky rotomw with rock blast if using cloyster on a sun team hidden power fire should be used instead of the watertype attack as it can hit steeltypes while getting pseudostab however this leaves cloyster walled by heatran which already gives sun teams problems so using cloyster on a sun team is not recommended that said using cloyster in conjunction with rain support from politoed is an excellent decision by boosting the power of hydro pump or razor shell rain allows cloyster to defeat checks such as conkeldurr specially defensive jirachi specially defensive forretress and magnezone after it sets up dual screens are also great support for cloyster with reflect up cloyster can survive jolly choice band terrakions close combat even after switching into one layer of spikes espeon is a fantastic partner as its ability magic bounce bounces back entry hazards and taunt which gives cloyster an easier time setting up entry hazard support is also greatly appreciated as with just stealth rock up cloyster can ohko choice scarf rotomw and choice scarf politoed most of the time both forretress and ferrothorn have good synergy but forretress can also utilize rapid spin to aid cloyster another useful teammate is magnezone since it can trap and ko troublesome pokemon such as scizor jirachi and ferrothorn giving cloyster a much easier time sweeping other options explosion could see use on one of cloysters sets but with the mechanics change in bw it is much less effective and thus better off not being used cloyster can potentially use a defensive utility set with rapid spin and spikes support but cloysters terrible ice typing undermines this role also a choice scarf set can come in handy for checking faster threats such as dragonite virizion tornadus latios and infernape among others however it is generally not recommended as cloysters lack of power is usually its downfall without shell smash to boost its stats checks and counters being part icetype is a doubleedged sword for cloyster on one hand it gains an awesome stab move but on the other it takes 25 damage from stealth rock whenever it switches in and is liable to being hit by both spikes and toxic spikes for this reason having stealth rock on the field is a good first answer to cloyster a bullet punch from choice band scizor will 2hko cloyster after it has taken stealth rock damage while the only thing cloyster can do back is hydro pump which fails to ohko scizor even at 2 leaving aside the fact that it has shaky accuracy if rain is up however scizor will be easily ohkoed mach punch users are also cloysters worst enemies life orb adamant breloom has a fairly high chance to ohko without shell smashs defense drop after stealth rock damage while unboosted conkeldurr can 2hko as cloyster is incredibly fast after shell smash there arent many choice scarf users that can outspeed it after it gets a boost however latios can do so and will send the clam sinking back to the briny depths with draco meteor under the sun chlorophyll users such as venusaur and sawsbuck can opt to run speedboosting natures in order to be faster than a 2 cloyster as well generally speaking bulky watertypes and steeltypes can handle cloyster bulky rotomw resists cloysters stab moves and can take a rock blast it can promptly ohko cloyster with thunderbolt making it a good switchin to it in general jellicent and tentacruel also have the capability to annoy cloyster greatly both can use scald on cloyster and hope for a burn among other options willowisp from jellicent will help prevent cloyster from being a huge problem while tentacruel can use toxic which will quickly wear cloyster down when used in tandem with protect slowbro is another bulky watertype that can tank anything cloyster can throw at it and target its weaker special defense stat with psychic or flamethrower it can also use thunder wave on cloyster to cripple it for the rest of the game keldeo deserves a special mention for being an offensive watertype that can survive 2 cloysters offensive artillery with some health to spare skarmory cant do much actual damage to cloyster but can whirlwind it out to prevent the immediate problem getting rid of cloysters stat boosts specially defensive jirachi can quite easily take cloysters water stab move and retaliate with thunder on a calm mind version or body slam and iron head on a physical version ferrothorn can take a 2 icicle spear and either hit back with power whip or cripple cloyster with thunder wave thanks to unaware ignoring shell smash boosts quagsire can take icicle spear nicely and toxic cloyster back or even hope to burn it with scald a slightly unusual but effective option to deal with cloyster is specially defensive heatran if hydro pump is favored over razor shell on cloyster it will be unable to ohko heatran even at 2 in return heatran will ohko cloyster with lava plume after stealth rock damage take note however that if rain is up heatran will be destroyed by any watertype move from cloyster
