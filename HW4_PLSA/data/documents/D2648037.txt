attempts to invade ireland in order to destabilise the united kingdom or as a steppingstone to great britain had already occurred in 1796 the first french army of england had gathered on the channel coast in 1798 but an invasion of england was sidelined by napoleons concentration on campaigns in egypt and against austria and shelved in 1802 by the peace of amiens building on planning for mooted invasions under frances ancien régime in 1744 1759 and 1779 preparations began again in earnest soon after the outbreak of war in 1803 and were finally called off in 1805 contrary to popular belief

200000 men known as the armée des côtes de locéan army of the ocean coasts or the armée dangleterre army of england was gathered and trained at camps at boulogne bruges and montreuil a large  national flotilla  1 of invasion barges was built in channel ports along the coasts of france and the netherlands then under french domination as the batavian republic  right from étaples to flushing and gathered at boulogne this flotilla was initially under the energetic command of eustache bruix but he soon had to return to paris where he died of tuberculosis in march 1805 the part of the flotilla built by the batavian navy was under the command of viceadmiral carel hendrik ver huell port facilities at boulogne were improved even though its tides made it unsuitable for such a role and forts built whilst the discontent and boredom that often threatened to overflow among the waiting troops was allayed by constant training and frequent ceremonial visits by napoleon himself including the first ever awards of the imperial légion dhonneur  2 a medal was struck and a triumphal column erected at boulogne to celebrate the invasions anticipated success 3 however when napoleon ordered a largescale test of the invasion craft despite choppy weather and against the advice of his naval commanders such as charles rené magon de médine commander of the flotillas right wing they were shown up as illdesigned for their task and though napoleon led rescue efforts in person many men were lost cartoon on the invasion showing a tunnel under the channel and a fleet of balloons napoleon also seriously considered using a fleet of troopcarrying balloons as part of his proposed invasion force and appointed marie madeline sophie blanchard as an air service chief though she said the proposed aerial invasion would fail because of the winds 4 frances first military balloon had been used in 1794 by jeanmarie coutelle 5 though an aerial invasion proved a deadend the prospect of one captured the minds of the british print media and public these preparations were financed by the louisiana purchase of 1803 whereby france ceded her huge north american territories to the united states in return for a payment of 50 million french francs   11250000 the entire amount was spent on the projected invasion the united states had partly funded the purchase by means of a loan from baring brothers a british bank 6for his planned subsidiary invasion of ireland napoleon had formed an irish legion in 1803 to create an indigenous part of his 20000man corps direlande british countermeasures

south coast of england martello towers were built along the english coast to counter the invasion threat and militias were raised in the areas closest to france new fortifications were built and existing ones initiated against the 1779 invasion completed or improved dover castle had underground tunnels added to garrison more troops the dover western heights were constructed with a grand shaft to deploy its troops from its hilltop site to sea level rapidly should a landing occur 7  and the royal military canal cut to impede napoleons progress into england should he land on romney marsh unfounded rumours of a massive flat french invasion raft powered by windmills and paddlewheels a secretlydug channel tunnel and an invasion fleet of balloons spread via the print media as did caricatures ridiculing the prospect of invasion a naval raid on boulogne was also carried out in october 1804 and british fleets continued to blockade the french and spanish fleets that would be needed to gain naval superiority long enough for a crossing naval plan  editbefore the flotilla could cross however napoleon had to gain naval control of the english channel – in his own words let us be masters of the channel for six hours and we are masters of the world he envisaged doing this by having the brest and toulon franco – spanish fleets break out from the british blockade led at brest by collingwood and toulon by nelson  and then sail across the atlantic to threaten the west indies this he hoped would draw off the royal navy force under william cornwallis defending the western approaches the toulon and brest fleets under pierrecharles villeneuve and honoré joseph antoine ganteaume respectively could then rendezvous at martinique quickly sail back across the atlantic to europe losing both these pursuing british fleets en route land a force in ireland as in the two french revolutionary invasions of ireland in 1796 and 1798 and more importantly defeat what parts of the channel fleet had remained in the channel take control of the channel and defend and transport the invasion force all before the pursuing fleets could return to stop them this plan was typical of napoleon in its dash and reliance on fast movement and surprise but such a style was more suited to land than to sea warfare with the vagaries of tide and wind and the effective british blockade making it ever more impractical and unlikely to succeed as more and more time passed only the toulon force eventually broke out on 29 march 1805 and though it managed to cross the atlantic it did not find the brest fleet at the rendezvous and so sailed back to europe alone where it was met by the force blockading rochefort and ferrol where invasion vessels had been prepared were defeated at the battle of cape finisterre and forced back into port therefore on 27 august 1805 napoleon used the invasion army as the core of the new grande armée and had it break camp and march eastwards to begin the ulm campaign thus by the time of the battle of trafalgar on 21 october the invasion had already been called off and so this battle further guaranteed british control of the channel rather than preventing the invasion the comment attributed to first lord of the admiralty lord st vincent – i do not say they the french cannot come – i only say they cannot come by sea – had been proved right
