chapter 3 world population and global inequality summary by russ long july 25 2017i world population a demographic transition1 the three phases of demographic transition demographic transition is a theory that explains population change it is a threestage pattern of population change that occurs as societies industrialize and urbanize weeks 19967780 it is a model that explains population dynamics of european  american industrial societiesa phase one high birth and high death rates characterize the first phase of demographic transition societies in the first phase then to be agrarian death rates are high because of disease infant mortality rates are high agrarian societies need a large labor forces who will work cheaply children are a readymade labor force children also provide care for the elderly their parents in order to ensure that there is ample labor birth rates are very high examples of nations that are in the first phase are ethiopia and el salvadorb phase two phase two societies are entering the early stages of industrialization high birth rates continue to characterize the second phase of demographic transition but death rates drop technology allows death rate to fall technology provides better sanitations improved medical care and increased food production  birth rates remain high in part because birth rates are driven by cultural norms as societies industrialize they experience a culture lag or sorts technology brings death rates down quickly but culture is slow to adjust there may be several generations where birth rates are high while death rates are low nations that are in the second phase include most of todays third world countries rapid population growth characterizes this phasec phase three societies in phase three of demographic transition tend to be industrialized and urban low birth rates low death rates and a stable population characterize the third phase societies may even begin to lose population in the absence of migration this phase includes most of europe japan and the united states parents are encouraged to keep families small in part because children become an economic burden in advanced industrial societies  it costs a lot to raise children and the economic necessities of having children diminish p eople are less dependent on their children as a personal labor force later in life the state provides for social security in order for population growth rates to be slowed in the developing world a demographic transition must occur birth rates must be reduced this can be brought about in part by offering family planning and effective methods of birth control it also involves the changing role of women2 demographic transition an economic explanation of population dynamics demographic transition is a population theory that relates economic development to patterns of population growth the general position of demographic transition is that if people feel economically secure then the population growth will slow in other words through industrialization people obtain a better standard of living and a better standard of living encourages smaller families to pass the good life on to their children parents keep their families small it makes sense middleclass necessities like a university education are expensive therefore families with several children find it more difficult to send all of their children to college for much of the industrial world the demographic transition model may be a good predictor of how populations in the world change there are signs however that much of the third world is not following the industrialized nations into the final phase of demographic transition  some nations have gotten stuck in the second phase countries that continue to experience high birth rates and low death rates might drop back into the first phase that means that death rates will go up dramatically b family planning beginning in the 1960s when the u s and the united nations began funding family planning programs in less developed countries all of the following have happened there was a decline in the number of children born in less developed nations there was an increase in the number of women using contraception there was a decrease in the annual population growth ii poverty a the third world and absolute poverty the worldwide inequality gap is demonstrated by all of the following facts people in the ten richest countries earned nine times as much per capita as those in the ten poorest the top onefifth of nations possess 86 percent of the worlds gdp and 68 percent of direct foreign investment the top onefifth of the worlds peoples consume 86 percent of the worlds goods and services while the poorest onefifth consume about one percent1 third world vs firstworld is there a third world many have problems with the allencompassing term thirdworld developing nations or the periphery after all countries link el salvador cambodia and sierra leone are lumped into the same category obviously these three countries share no cultural characteristics and are physically farremoved from one another one might suggest that its ridiculous to categorize these countries the same on the other hand el salvador cambodia and sierra leone as well as a host of other developing countries do share a common relationship to the advanced industrialized countries of the world the firstworld developed nations or the core historically the common relationship was colonialism more recently old colonial affairs characterized by military oppression have transformed into neocolonial relationships at present military control has given way to a situation where rich countries control poor countries through international markets the core determines prices for commodities and uses the poor countries as dumping grounds for hazardous waste see henslin 19992452 absolute poverty in general absolute poverty is a condition that exists when people do not have the means to secure the most basic necessities of life kendall 199831 conditions that threaten the developing world include the following malnourishment results in low levels of energy vitamin deficiencies make people more susceptible to infectious diseases protein deficiencies often leaves infants with permanent brain damage b food and hunger c sickness and disease d the new slavery the new slavery includes the following women and children end up as bonded labor in factories and sweatshops boys are frequently forced to work in coffee and cocoa plantations girls end up as domestic workers or prostitutes e the concentration of misery in cities also see the vultures of caliiii u s relations with the third world dependency theory dependency theory is an approach to explaining global stratification that argues the lack of industrial development in the least industrialized nations is caused by the industrialized nations domination the world economy in fact dependency theories argue that the poverty experienced by lowincome countries is the immediate consequence of their exploitation by wealthy countries on which they are economically dependent appelbaum  chambliss 1997173 poor countries are lockedin to a downward spiral of exploitation and poverty andre gunder frank 1972 calls this the development of underdevelopment dependency results when foreign businesses make important economic and political decisions for their own advantage and without regard to the best interests of the local population  except for a few local businessmen who serve the interests of foreign capital the local population becomes impoverished appelbaum  chambliss 1997173 dependency theories contend that power is central in enforcing unequal economic arrangements local leaders opposed to inequitable economic arrangements are suppressed unionization is outlawed a popular government opposed to outside influence can be overthrown by the military often the police and the military act not for the needs of the masses but rather for the economic elite appelbaum  chambliss 1997174 a colonialism in 1914 70 of the worlds population lived in colonies colonialism is the process by which some nations enrich themselves through political and economic control and exploitation of other nations the colony has its labor and natural resources exploited by the more powerful nation raw material and human labor was extracted for export the culture of the country is often seen as primitive and backwards by the colonizer colonization severely distorted the social cultural and economic structures of poor countries colonialism has made developing nations more dependent on the wealthy nations of the world  much of the poverty experienced in the developing world today is a result of hundreds of years of colonial rule the wealth that was generated in colonies was held by a few local elites and by the colonizing power little of the wealth remained in the colonized country to assist in local development local production is often for the export market and does not benefit the local population therefore it is possible for a colonized country to produce abundant food while simultaneously its citizens go hungry b multinational corporations and neocolonialism traditional colonization was characterized by the direct rule of a foreign power which often involved the use of the colonizers military neocolonialism is carried out by corporate entities located in wealthy countries multinational corporations locate in developing countries general seeking cheap labor the impact on poor countries of multinationals however is similar to that experienced when developing countries were traditional colonies multinational corporations have access to the latest technology multinational corporations receive better terms than local companies when they borrow money multinational corporations are tied to global banks through interlocking directorates and shared ownership poor countries are kept in a dependent status in part by the heavy debt carried by firstworld banks money that local countries desperately need for development instead is spent servicing their debt the following contributes to the enormous advantage that global corporations have over local competition when they move into an underdeveloped country1 arms sales rather than spending resources of social services poor countries often spend much of their resources on military goods previously independent selfgoverning political processes now include outside powers natural resources are exploited to help pay off the debt incurred from spending on the military massive debt means less money for social services other consequences of selling arms to the developing world include the following the political and cultural stability of a given region can be altered the recipient country could use its newly acquired arms for purposes other than defense arms could even be used against the selling country2 corporate sales that endanger lifea corporate dumping eitzen 200373 describes corporate dumping as the exporting of goods that have been banned or not approved untested for sale in the united states toxic waste is an example  generally the market for these goods is found in the third world these countries do not bar the importation of banned substances further their citizenry is often illiterate and therefore unaware of the dangers c first world foreign assistance wealthy nations should provide aid to developing nations with the following provisions the aid should be used for truly humanitarian purposes the aid should reach the intended targets and not the well off elites governments that receive the aid should have sensible and humane plans for using the new resources
