listen r eady to go on a picnic here in wonderopolis we love to grab a blanket and a big basket full of food and head out to our favorite picnic spot next to the lake of course theres always one problem uninvited visitors who are we talking about ants of coursebut where do they come from when we pick out our picnic spot we never see any ants around as soon as we get out the food though there they are are they hiding and just waiting for us ants tend to live in large groups called colonies some insects and animals live by themselves they work alone to find food for themselves ants on the other hand live with many other ants they each have a special job that benefits the group as a whole if youve ever seen an anthill you may have noticed ants marching back and forth carrying dirt leaves and other things they can use for the colony ants are hard workers that can lift things many times their own body weight ants have learned that it pays to work together toward a common goal it would be hard for a single ant to survive on its own working together though ants are able to divide up all the work that needs to be done so that all the ants in the colony can not only survive but thriveant colonies are very organized groups most colonies have three types of ants the queen the males and the workers the queen mates with the males to lay as many eggs as possible this keeps the population of the colony going strong the workers are the female ants other than the queen who do the rest of the work gathering food building the nest and defending it from intruders so how many ants can live in a colony if youve ever found an anthill around your house or school you may have noticed what seemed like hundreds of ants crawling around it the largest ant colonies can be way bigger than that though its not uncommon for some ant colonies to contain millions of antsants have become so successful at working together that they can be found just about everywhere on earth the only places without ants are antarctica and a few remote islands when ants build a nest they often burrow into the ground or under rocks or a fallen tree they start small and expand their nest as necessary to make room for new ants some burrows can be identified by finding small mounds or anthills that are used to enter and exit the nest as nests grow they can become extremely large and complex consisting of interconnected corridors and chambers some ant colonies occupy nests covering an entire acre or more
