description this document addresses neonatal levels of care hospitals vary in the type of newborn care they provide not all facilities are capable of providing all types of care needed for sick newborns the american academy of pediatrics aap has defined the levels of care loc required for the normal healthy newborn to the critically ill newborn these loc correspond to the therapies and services provided in each nursery facilities offering neonatal intensive care must meet healthcare standards through federalstate licensing or certification all loc described in this document are based upon clinical care needs and are not dependent upon the physical location of the infant within the health care facility or the name of the unit where the care is delivered a medically necessary neonatal level of care indicates the intensity of services needed or rendered based on an infants clinical status and is not the same as aap levels of nursery designation which are based on the facility clinical service capabilities clinical indications medically necessary admission to and continued stay in appropriate neonatal levels of care are considered medically necessary for the following indications general nursery or wellbaby nursery this level of care is for healthy neonates who are physiologically stable and receiving evaluation and observation in the immediate postpartum period infants weighing 2000 grams or more at birth and clinically stable infants at 35 weeks gestational age or greater may be cared for in a wellbaby nursery this is not a neonatal intensive care level phototherapy intravenous iv fluids or medications and antibiotic therapy are not appropriate for general nursery or wellbaby nursery level of care examples of types of services neonates receive or clinical conditions managed at this level of care are oral nipple feedings for asymptomatic hypoglycemia not requiring subsequent iv therapylaboratory tests examples include but are not limited to bilirubin blood glucose blood type and coombs direct antiglobulin test dat complete blood count cbc creactive protein screening blood culture or oximetryobservation for development of signs of neonatal abstinence syndrome in an infant with known antenatal exposure to opioids and benzodiazepines wellbaby nursery level of care excludes pharmacologic therapy of neonatal abstinence syndrometransient use of an external heat source to maintain temperature stability in an otherwise well infant level i surveillance special care nursery this level of care covers neonates who are medically stable but require surveillancecare at a higher level than provided in the general nursery examples of types of services neonates receive or clinical conditions managed at this level are apneabradycardia oral pharmacologic therapy for a baby who has been apneafree for at least 72 hours or surveillance without pharmacological intervention and 48 hours or more since last episode requiring interventiondiagnostic workupsurveillance on an otherwise stable neonate under 35 weeks gestational age where no therapy is initiatedhyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapyinfants transferred from a higher level of care who are physiologically stable breathing room air in an open crib and taking either no medications or on a stable or declining dose of oral medications and requiring observation to document successful nipple feedinginitial sepsis evaluation cbc blood culture for an asymptomatic neonateisolettewarmer for observation or convenience of access adjunctive therapy and no other level ii iii or iv criteria presentiv fluids and enteral feedings as follows iv fluids administered at 50 mlkgday or less for routine fluid electrolyte glucose and nutritional purposes in stable infants who are being weaned off of iv fluids and receiving enteral feedings by any combination of nasogastric gastrostomy or nipple feedings without other clinical conditions qualifying for a higher level of carenipple feedings are 50 or greater of total enteral feedingsservices rendered for neonatal abstinence syndrome continuation of medication weaning for infants whose neonatal abstinence scores are 8 or less nonpharmacologic management of neonatal abstinence scores greater than 8 by provision of a nonstimulating environment which may include maternal roominginservices rendered to growing premature infant without supplemental oxygen or iv fluid needs or environmental control needs other than blankets cap swaddling etc level ii neonatal intensive care newborns admitted or treated at this level are those with physiological immaturity combined with medical instabilities examples of types of services neonates receive or clinical conditions managed at this level of care are infants born 32 weeks gestation or greater and under 35 weeks gestation or infants weighing 1500 grams or more who have physiologic immaturity and who are moderately ill with problems that are expected to resolve rapidly and are not anticipated to need subspecialty services on an urgent basisapnea or bradycardia apnea or bradycardia episode requiring stimulationoral pharmacologic treatment for apnea or bradycardic episodes when last episode requiring intervention was less than 72 hours agoenteral feedings as follows enteral feedings via a feeding tube located within the duodenum or jejunumtube feedings of any type where the infusiondelivery time exceeds 30 minutesin infants receiving gavage and nipple feedings where the volume delivered by gavage feedings is at 50 or greater of the total enteral feeding volume incubator or warmer therapies documented need for environmental control via an incubatorwarmer for thermoregulationphysiologically stable infants in the process of being weaned from an incubatorwarmer to an open crib iv therapy iv fluids inclusive of total parenteral nutrition greater than or equal

must also care for the newborn in most cases newborns do not require care beyond that of a general nursery however newborn complications can occur even when an uneventful birth is anticipated it is important that facilities have equipment and capabilities to address these events or the process to stabilize and transport the ill newborn to a facility that does the highrisk neonate is a newborn who has encountered an event in prenatal perinatal or postnatal life that leads to a high probability of manifesting a physiological or psychological deficit that requires admission to a neonatal intensive care unit nicu complications requiring a nicu admission can occur in premature and term infants infants born between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy are considered full term those born before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy are considered premature or late preterm a late preterm infant is a premature baby born between 34 and 36 weeks gestational age this is relatively close to full term which is 37 weeks or greater engle 2007 for 2015 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc martin 2017 reported that preterm birth less than 37 completed weeks gestation affected about 1 of every 10 infants born in the united states 963 of those the early preterm birth rate less than 34 weeks was essentially stable at 276 in 2015 and was down from 293 in 2007 the late preterm birth rate 34–36 weeks rose slightly from 682 to 687 a small rise in the percentage of infants born low birth weight less than 2500 grams was also seen from 2014 to 2015 from 800 to 807 newborn complications

persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn pneumonia pneumothorax bronchopulmonary dysplasia atelectasis in 2012 the aap issued a policy statement outlining the designations of levels of neonatal care to distinguish and standardize newborn care capabilities offered by hospitals the aap designations consist of levels iiv and encompass all newborn care from general care of the healthy newborn to care of the critically ill newborn each level reflects the minimal capabilities functional criteria and provider type required however examples of medically necessary levels of neonatal care such as hyperalimentation and treatment of apneabradycardia noted in this document indicate the intensity of services needed or rendered based on an infants clinical status as described by expert clinical input and are not the same as aap designations which are based on the facility clinical service capabilities hudak and colleagues 2012 for the aap released a neonatal drug withdrawal report indicating the predominant tool used in the united states to quantify the severity of neonatal withdrawal is the modified neonatal abstinence scoring system the system assigns a cumulative score based on the interval observation of 21 items relating to signs of neonatal withdrawal signs of neonatal withdrawal scored on the tool include central nervous system disturbances metabolicvasomotorrespiratory disturbances and gastrointestinal disturbances a prospective randomized controlled trial by yoder and colleagues 2013 assessed the safety and efficacy of heated humidified highflow nasal cannula hhhfnc as compared to nasal continuous positive airway pressure n cpap for noninvasive respiratory support in the newborn intensive care unit a total of 432 infants ranging from 28 to 42 weeks gestational age were enrolled in the study inclusion criteria included a birth weight of at least 1000 grams and gestational age at least 28 weeks and randomization to either noninvasive no endotracheal tube respiratory support from birth initiated in the first 24 hours of life or noninvasive respiratory support at any age after a period of mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube exclusion criteria included a birth weight less than1000 grams gestational age less than 28 weeks presence of active air leak syndrome concurrent participation in a study that prohibited hhhfnc abnormalities of upper and lower airways or serious abdominal cardiac or respiratory malformations including tracheal esophageal fistula intestinal atresia omphalocele gastroschisis or diaphragmatic hernia the primary study outcome was defined as a need for intubation within 72 hours of applied noninvasive therapy there was no difference in early failure for hhhfnc versus n cpap subsequent need for any intubation or in any of several adverse outcomes analyzed including air leak hhhfnc infants remained on the study mode significantly longer than n cpap infants median 4 vs 2 days respectively p  001 however there were no differences between study groups for days on supplemental oxygen median 10 vs 8 days bronchopulmonary dysplasia 20 vs 16 or hospital discharge on oxygen 19 vs 18 the authors concluded additional large randomized trials are needed to evaluate the use of hhhfnc among smaller preterm infants as well as to compare different devices for and approaches to administering hhhfnc definitions finnegan neonatal abstinence scoring system modified a system that assigns a cumulative score based on the interval observation of the following 21
