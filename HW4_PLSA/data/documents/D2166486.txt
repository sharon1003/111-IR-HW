05202014 0644 pm edtshare on facebook share on twitter conservative author and filmmaker dinesh d’souza entered a guilty plea tuesday to a charge that he used straw donors to make 20000 in illegal contributions to republican senate candidate wendy long in 2012 officials said the unexpected guilty plea came on the same day the trial for the strident critic of president barack obama was set to open in u s district court in manhattan the single felony count d’souza admitted guilt on carries a maximum prison sentence of two years but the plea agreement d’souza’s lawyers reached with the government says sentencing guidelines applicable to the case call for a sentence of 10 to 16 months judges are not required to sentence defendants in accordance with the guidelines but usually do both sides reserved their rights to argue for a sentence outside that range and d’souza’s lawyer benjamin brafman indicated he plans to ask judge richard berman not to send d’souza to prison the plea deal calls for dismissal of a second charge d’souza faced if he went to trial causing long to file a false report with the federal election commission that carried a potential sentence of up to five years behind bars“we are hopeful that judge berman will recognize mr d’souza to be a fundamentally honorable man who should not be imprisoned for what was an isolated instance of wrongdoing in an otherwise productive and responsible life” brafman said in a statement emailed to reporters d’souza’s case has become a cause celebre for conservative activists and lawmakers who have complained that he was singled out by the justice department because of his views including the apocalyptic film “2016 obama’s america” d’souza also worked as a white house policy adviser under president ronald reagan“dinesh d’souza who did a very big movie criticizing the president is now being prosecuted by this administration” sen ted cruz rtexas said in a portion of a january cbs interview edited out by the network but posted online by cruz’s office “can you image the reaction if the bush administration had went gone and prosecuted michael moore and alec baldwin and sean penn”cruz and three other senators mike lee of utah chuck grassley of iowa and jeff sessions of alabama also sent fbi director james comey a letter in february seeking more information about prosecutors’ claims that d’souza’s case arose from a routine fbi review of fec filings which show refunds and reallocations of contributions to long’s unsuccessful bid d’souza moved unsuccessfully to challenge the charges on the basis of selective prosecution but u s attorney preet bharara said in a statement tuesday that the case was handled without any political bias“we will investigate and prosecute violations of federal law particularly those that undermine the integrity of the democratic electoral process without regard to the defendant’s political persuasion or party affiliation that is what we did in this case and what we will continue to do” bharara said at the court hearing tuesday d’souza admitted he knew what he did was against the law“i knew that causing a campaign contribution to be made in the name of another was wrong and something the law forbids” d’souza said according to newsday “i deeply regret my conduct”brafman added in his press statement “mr d’souza agreed to accept responsibility for having urged two close associates to make contributions of 10000 each to the unsuccessful 2012 senate campaign of wendy long and then reimbursing them for their contributions given the technical nature of the charge there was no viable defense”berman set d’souza’s sentencing for sept 23 in addition to capping the amount of jail time d’souza could face the plea deal could help minimize attention to embarrassing aspects of the case that go beyond the illegality the author admitted to tuesday evidence disclosed in pretrial motions indicated that two of the illegal donations were routed through d’souza’s mistress denise joseph and her husband louis joseph in 2012 d’ souza resigned from his post as president of evangelical king’s college in new york following reports that he attended a south carolina conference on christian values accompanied by denise joseph and introduced her as his fiancee despite the fact that he was still married at the time to another woman he later said in a statement he’d been separated from his wife for two years and “had no idea that it is considered wrong in christian circles to be engaged prior to being divorced even though in a state of separation and in divorce proceedings”share on facebook share on twitter this article tagged under fundraising campaign contributions dinesh dsouza wendy long missing out on the latest scoops sign up
