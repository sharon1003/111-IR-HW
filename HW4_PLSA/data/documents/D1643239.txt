beets float into the factory by themselves by water in a flume on the way they pass through a rockcatcher for the removal of any rocks mud or sand and then through another section for the removal of any trash weeds or leaves they then flow into a beet wheel to be elevated into the beet washer from the washer they move by pump and on across a rollerspray table for additional washing the beets are fed from the hopper into the slicers where they are cut into long noodlelike pieces resembling shoestring potatoes these are called cossettes emerging from the slicers the cossettes fall onto a conveyor belt to be carried across a continuous weighing device and then discharged into a scalding tank leading to the diffuser here the sugar is removed from the cossettes by being dissolved in hot water water enters the opposite end to that of the cossettes giving a counter flow effect the diffuser works continuously to extract sugar from the cossettes the process of diffusion uses osmosis or the passage of sugar through the porous membrane of the beet cossettes to the water the sugar solution leaves the diffuser at the same end it enters in the form of raw juice when the cossettes reach the opposite end  free of most of their sugar  they become beet pulp and move on to the pulp dryer upon leaving the diffuser the raw juice moves through the various stages of purification and filtration to remove impurities and other nonsugars it is first heated in the raw juice heaters it is then pumped to the first carbonation station here the raw juice is mixed with milk of lime and simultaneously treated with carbon dioxide gas co 2 from the lime kiln the co 2 enters the gassing tank under control to give the juice the proper p h or alkalinity upon leaving the first carte station now the carbonated juice flows onto the dorr thickener the thickener tank acts to settle out the precipitate formed in the juice of milk of lime and carbon dioxide this leaves a clear juice to be sent to the heaters and then on to the second carbonation station the mud or sludge remaining on the bottom of the thickener goes to the drum filters for washing in order to recover any other sugar after this the mud goes to the holding pond the filtrate and the wash water from the drum filters now become sweetwater it goes to the lime kiln to be mixed with burned lime any excess goes back to the first carte tank in the second carte tank the clear juice again mixes with co 2 gas at a controlled rate to obtain the proper p h or alkalinity it then moves on to the second carte filters for the removal of precipitates formed by the co 2 gas and the lime left in the juice from first carbonation this precipitate goes to the sludge tank and then back to the drum filters for further washing while the clear juice from the second filters moves on to the third saturation station in third saturation the juice mixes with sulfur dioxide so 2 gas this gas inhibits some color forming reactions in the juice that would eventually appear in the finished sugar but its main function is the final adjustment of p h for sugar end liquors the juice then moves on to the evaporator supply tank and becomes known as thin juice from the supply tank the thin juice moves through heaters and then to the evaporation station this consists of five bodies or effects inside the bodies steam heat removes excess water from the thin juice in five successive stages it concentrates the dry substance in the juice from a range of 13 percent to 15 percent upon entering the first body to 65 percent to 70 percent upon leaving the fifth body in other words while going through the evaporation station the thin juice becomes thick juice thick juice is split at this point and that portion which the sugar end cannot handle is cooled the p h adjusted and pumped to storage for reentry following the slicing operation the evaporator thick juice goes to the high melter station in this flow the thick juice is used to dilute and melt the high raw sugar it is then sent through the filters to the standard liquor storage tank the standard liquor moves on to the white pan to be boiled and crystallized to a high concentration of sugar called white massecuite this heavy mass then drops into the white mixer from the mixer the white massecuite drops into the white centrifugal machines here the spinning action of the centrifugals separates the sugar crystals from the liquor containing sugar syrups and impurities the crystals remaining in the centrifugal basket undergo further spinning for washing and some drying the spun sugar then drops to a conveyor to be moved up to the granulator for further drying and cooling the finished sugar then passes over screen sifters and moves on to the bulk sugar bins for storage or to the warehouse for packaging this completes the straightline flow of the process from sugarbeets to beet sugar  but other sideline processes still remain to recover more of the sugar from the beet the white side of the sugar end comprises only the first stage in the complete crystallization and separation process  that is the white pan and white centrifugals handle the material with the highest purity and the greatest yield other sugar  along with important byproducts  still remain in the syrups and washwater spun off by the white centrifugals these must be recrystallized in the sugar end there is the higreen syrup it is spun off by the white centrifugals before the application of wash water on the massecuite there is also the hiwash spun off by the white machines during the actual washing period the hiwash usually flows to the himelter meantime the higreen goes to the storage tank and then to the hiraw pan there much like on the white side the syrup is boiled down to a high concentration where crystallization is induced it then drops into the hiraw mixer from there it goes to the hiraw centrifugals where the spinning action again separates the crystals from the syrup and impurities from these centrifugals the hiraw crystals go back to the process instead of to final product storage hiraw sugar moves to the himelter to be mixed with the high wash and also thick juice as a controlled brix or concentration this himelter mixture flows back to the blowup tank to be mixed with thick juice where it reenters the process as standard liquor on the white side there is also the machine syrup spun off by the hiraw centrifugals it goes to the machine syrup storage tank on the pan floor and then to the lowraw pan here again boiling to a concentration where crystallization can take place but instead of going directly from the pan to the centrifugal machines the loraw massecuite drops to the crystallizers for cooling and further crystallization over a period ranging from 20 to 40 hours with this completed the lowraw mass goes to the loraw mixer and then to the loraw centrifugal once again the spinning action separates the crystals from the liquor the loraw sugar goes to the loraw melter with thin juice added there and then on to the lomelter storage tank for use in hiraw pan the lomelter can also be sent to the himelter if quality allows the crystallization and separation cycles end with the molasses spun off by the loraw centrifugals this molasses will be shipped by rail tank car or trucks to consumers the lime kiln supplies burned lime and co 2 gas for the regular factory process both products result from the burning of limestone with coke in controlled amounts in the kiln for the regular factory process the burned limerock goes to the slacker to be mixed with sweetwater this produces milk of lime for use in first carbonation the from the lime kiln enters the regular co 2 gas factory process at both first and second carbonation a direct byproduct of the sugar process dried and pelleted beet pulp provides highly nutritious feed for livestock the operation begins with the exhausted cossettes emerging from the upper end of the diffuser in the sugar factory this pulp still set moves to the dryer house on belts or scrolls to the pulp press the mechanical squeezing action of the presses reduces the moisture of the pulp to about 77 percent the pressed pulp then enters the dryer drums fired by oil or natural gas where the furnaces reduce the moisture content from 77 percent to about 10 percent now in dried form the pulp moves on conveyors to the pellet mills under the compaction of the pellet mills the pulp emerges in a hardened form for easier handling it then goes to bulk storage in the pulp warehouse almost all of the processing operations in the sugar factory depend upon the steam boiler house and electric generators for power a critical factor in economical processing the steam boilers may be fired either by coal oil or gas steam furnishes the supply of heat required for many process operations and also passes through a turbogenerator to provide electrical power to move machinery
