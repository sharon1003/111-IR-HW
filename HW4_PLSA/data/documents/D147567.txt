brendan maloneyusa today sports the san antonio spurs completed their nba finals victory against the miami heat on sunday marking the teams fifth championship since the beginning of the tim duncan era while we all gush about rings on thumbs and what this all means for the legacies of duncan gregg popovich and everyone else lets take a look back at the five squads that got us to this point199899its not easy to remember now but the spurs werent always the spurs weve come to regard with a mixture of respect gratitude and general awe twenty years ago this was still a franchise without a title one of those classic teams that couldnt quite get over the hump then of course came the 1997 nba draft and the arrival of duncan after a year of straightening the bearings winning 56 games and challenging the utah jazz in the west semifinals the spurs officially took over the league during the lockoutshortened 199899 season with a lineup led by duncan an aging david robinson and an impressive cache of role players  sean elliott avery johnson mario elie etc  the spurs captured their first championship by beating the eighthseeded new york knicks in five games and if you think the spurs beat up miami this year check out what the team did 15 years ago first round beat the timberwolves in five second round swept shaq and the lakers west finals how about another sweep this time against portland and then came the finals where the knicks were dispatched in five duncan won the finals mvp the thirdyoungest player to do so before kawhi leonard this year200203after that first title the spurs struggled in the postseason for a few years the reinforcements were coming however in 2001 the team drafted french point guard tony parker in the first round then a year later argentinian shooting guard emmanuel ginobili got snagged with a flyer deep into the second round with those two slowly emerging to fill out the roster and robinson announcing his intention to retire at the end of the season 200203 loomed as a special opportunity for the team following through the spurs won 60 games in the regular season and cruised through the playoffs winning all four series in six games apiece duncan won nba mvp  his second straight  during the regular season then delivered one of the greatest postseasons in history 24 games 247 points per game 157 rebounds per game 53 assists per game 33 blocks per game seriously if someone needs to be convinced that duncan is one of the greatest athletes to ever play go show them highlights of the finals against new jersey masterclass200405the arrival of the big three to san antonio after a couple years to mature and improve parker and ginobili emerged as legitimate stars for the spurs during this season finally armed with some serious weapons to back duncan surely the spurs had no issues getting that third title right nope instead parker and ginobili were thrown into the fire against the detroit pistons in one of the most interesting nba series of the past 20 years following four straight blowouts to begin the 2005 finals game 5 gave us one of the most memorable performances in recent history robert horrys threepoint barrage culminating with the gamewinner in the final seconds to put san antonio up 32 robert horry game 5 nba finals 2005your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  135san antonio would eventually need seven games to top detroit with duncan becoming the fourth player in league history to win a third finals mvp award that still hasnt changed as michael jordan shaquille oneal and magic johnson are the only others with threeplus trophies200607the spurs and le bron james have developed quite the history with one another starting seven years ago when james carried the cleveland cavaliers to the finals san antonio was in a different class at this point though and pummeled the cavs during a fourgame sweep this championship also stands as the first time san antonio won a title without duncan winning finals mvp instead that honor went to parker who dominated the series by averaging 244 points per game on 57 percent shooting duncan wasnt a slouch either going for 183 points and 115 rebounds per contest and more importantly the spurs vaunted defense shut down le bron while the 2014 edition of the team is powered by a mindnumbingly efficient offense san antonios past teams were often defined by defense in this series james averaged 2377 but shot just 36 percent from the field and 20 percent behind the arc201314and now were here popovich duncan parker and ginobili are still around but the rest of the formula has changed completely the current spurs look nothing like the past championship teams which may be a bigger testament to the greatness of the core figures than anything else redeeming the franchise after an incredible disappointment the previous year san antonio came out in this series and played some of the best basketball weve ever seen adam silvers postgame comments on the spurs showing the beauty of basketball werent just some offhand thoughts more likely a lot of people came away from this series agreeing with that sentiment this championship also signaled the emergence of leonard the 22yearold forward being tasked with continuing the standard of excellence established over so many and if these games showed us anything its that an entire league should be ready to deal with the spurs newest star as for the rest of the core guys like popovich duncan and ginobili probably arent done yet which really means one thing we best be prepared to have the same discussion next year as long as those guys are around and leonard keeps getting better the spurs will probably
