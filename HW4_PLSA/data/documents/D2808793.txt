early 20s to late 30s ran in a mile race the winning time was 514 it was acheived by a 28 year old and a 33 year old who were within 02 seconds of each other the slowest time was 711 by the oldest in the group  a 38 year old my time as the second oldest at 36 was 654 is there any standard for what someone should be able to run at my age im wondering if i should feel good about my time i didnt start running until my late 20s i was too into video games in high school10302011 0842 amxianshengg 366 posts read 619959 times reputation 465quote originally posted by coolcats we had a little

your question without any knowledge of a scientific study on the topic it depends on the level of your conditioning more than your age 81 year old marathon woman  you tube10302011 1035 amwutitiz

httpwwwrunnersworldcomcdaagegradingcalculator07977s6238277415000html  broken link there is no 1 mile selection so choose other and enter 10 mile distance when i plugged in the 28yrold at 514 i got a 70 age graded rating 38yr  711 got 53 100 translates to world record level adjusted for your age i am 55 and dont know for sure my mile time but figure i could get to 5 minutes  change i usually work up to 10x800 at 115 mph about a 513 minmile pace when trying to peak but thats on a treadmill which is easier if only because of the airresistance factor i plugged in 515 and got 84 agegraded time it said i would need 425 to be worldrecordlevel there are a bunch of runners arround my age who are well ahead of me heres an article from 2009 about a guy from my region about the same age as me who ran

reputation 20198id drop out after the first 2 blocks of the race and not bother to even try to complete it i dont run i find nothing wrong with that ive no interest or desire to run i value my feet knees and spine too much to try i dont even jog my bones cant handle high impactstyle movement i can sprint a block if i had to run away from something or had to run toward something i can walk for a reasonable distance and do walk as often as possible but more as a means of transportation and to enjoy breathing fresh air rather than an exercise regime im never paying attention to how long its taking me to do it unless i need to get somewhere by a certain time for a certain reason11262011 1225 pmdrummer boy location austin texas2756 posts read 5109688 times reputation 4591quote originally

hs and college track guy i have trouble believing in the times youve posted winning time of 514 lolthat time would probably win almost any high school track meet as well as a goodly percentage of ncaa ones so two regular dudes messing around on their lunch hour in street clothes and attaining that pace is pretty far out possible but not likely bro 711 the slowest lol again id reckon that 90 of men between the ages of 19 and 40 could not run that oh but one of the 10 just happens to be among your work group of super runners eh lastly if you can run a subsevenminute mile at 36 you are doing fine and need no running advice of course insofar as cardio conditioning is concerned you are better off running say three or four miles at a slower pace like maybe 900mile every other day or so aeorobic conditioning is more dependent on maximizing the amount of time you can keep your heartrate up than it is on how fast you can run one mile11262011 0600 pmhooligan location charlotte nc7658 posts read

athletes as well httpwwwcarolinastrackandfieldorordholderspdf im betting your 1 mile track was less than a mile11262011 0659 pmtd333 location albuquerque new mexico2117 posts read 4425736 times

sceptical of this claim and the original posters a two mile time of 1144 would mean you shoud be able to run a 5k under 1830 the following results are from a district cross country meet in western pa wpial aaa boys championship in this 5k boys championship 52 of the 345 runners ran under 1830 these are the 345 runners who qualified for this district championship race from the largest high schools in southwestern pa you want more more reasons for my scepticism look at any of the 5k results listed on this site httpwwwrunhighcomresultsbyyrhtml the top finishers in any of these races are people who train seriously this 5k brentwood firecracker 5k had 1549 finishers and 36 people ran under 1830 anyone who is breaking 1830 for a 5k is running anywhere from 35 to 60 miles a week including intervals on the track weightlifting does very little if anything to help you run with little or no running very few people regardless of age can run a mile faster than 8 minutes please register to
