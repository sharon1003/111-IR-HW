long number in csv file appearing in scientific notation by default microsoft office for developers  excel for developers question0sign in to vote hihow can i stop a long number in a csv file that is opened in excel from appearing in scientific notation by defaulteg hello 778002405501  yesbecomeshello  778002e11  yes i have tried wrapping the data in quotes in the csv but to no avail thanks in advancealistair thursday november 25 2010 1247 amreply  quote answers2sign in to vote i think the best way is to read the file as text by renaming the file extension to txt then when you open the file a dialog window will come up select delimited file and go through each window one the 2nd window check only the comma for the delimiter column now here is the trick the third window you can select each field and specify if you want the column to be read in as text or number choose text for the field with large numbers you can also use from the data menu import external data which will bring up the same menu as above with a csv file the problem with excel is the normal opening of a csv file bypasses the dialog box to allow you to select the column type as textjdweng marked as answer by

application that creates the csv files and dont have a choice of using txt files instead the users doubleclick csv file and it launches excel and opens the doc when the user views the the columns the longer numbers all display in scientific notation the users dont want to have to reformat the doc each time they go in is there anything we can embed inside the csv file in text format to set the column width to be larger than the default 843 monday january 17 2011 1000 pmreply  quote0sign in to vote i csv file contains only text comma seperated values and no formating you cant include anything into the csv file to format to automaticaly set the column widths you can create a workbook with a macro which will automatically open the csv file and set the formating to the correct style you can have your application put the cvs file in the same folder as a macro enabled workbook so the users would open the workbook instead of the csv file the workbook can contain a workbook open macro that would allow the user to select the csv file to import what application are you using to create the csv maybe that can be modifiedjdweng monday january 17 2011 1112 pmreply  quote0sign in to vote joel one of our other developers embeds text 12345678900 including the quotes inside the csv file and it appears to leave the number in standard format the column width doesnt change so the user still has to expand the column width to see it completely tuesday january 18 2011 234 pmreply  quote0sign in to votethe statement has an error the parameter following the comma should be a text string indicating th eformat since the string already is in double quotes you must put two sets of double quotes in the statement like thistext 12345678900jdweng tuesday january 18 2011 414 pmreply  quote0sign in to vote joel im starting to be concerned about your advice first you stated we could not embed any functionality inside the csv now youre stating that yes we can but my format is incorrect the statement i listed is precisely correct and is not in error  when i open excel it displays the number in standard form inside the 843 column width below is from the raw csv file itself that produces the correct excel result loan numbertypevendorord byreasonvaliddoneorder text sent text 6467507360fhaaaaippvirepassnotext 0no text 7034378620fhapatcmcmippassyes91003050text 2000036130no what im still after is whether theres an embed i can use to autofit the column width on csv open to the largest cell in that column  that would complete my issue can you assist there please tuesday january 18 2011 432 pmreply  quote0sign in to vote iim sorry that i confused you in this case format means two diffferent things the format of the cell which can be the background color yellow the text formula the 2nd parameter is also refered to as the format in this case youi are not changing the cell format but instead the format of the text string displayed when you open a csv by double clicking on the file name in a window explorer all the cells on the worksheet default initially to general format excel will test each file to see if it recognizes the data in the file as one of the standard formats for example if you have a date in the csv file excel will automatically change the format of the cell to date you cant specifically upload any formating information to force a cell to a particular format like specifying the column width excel will be able to recognize a formula in the csv file since all formula will start with an equal sign the formula you are uploading below is not correcttext 6467507360it should betext 6467507360 which doesnt make any sense usually people use something like thistext 1234567890000so you csv file should look like thistext 646750736000fhaaaaippvirepassno  notice i put two sets of double quotes around 000jdweng tuesday january 18 2011 603 pmreply  quote0sign in to vote you can change the extension from csv to xls and use

general format general format will often modified data when general is selected the spreadsheet tries to use an intelligent algorithm to determine the type of data this intelligent algorithm is very stupid and very often makes mistakesjdweng wednesday january 21 2015 232 pmreply  quote0sign in to vote hello andrew i noticed an identical problem as you described text 890141042114726267150 appears
