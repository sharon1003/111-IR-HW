the scoville heat scale definition hot sauces chilli peppers chemicals the scoville scale is a measure of the hotness of a chilli pepper or anything derived from chilli peppers ie hot sauce the scale is actually a measure of the concentration of the chemical compound capsaicin which is the active component that produces the heat sensation for humans the name capsaicin comes from the scientific classification of the pepper plant a type of fruit that belongs to the genus capsicum capsaicin 8methyl nvanillyl 6nonenamide occurs naturally in chilli peppers together with a number of very similar compounds referred to generically as capsaicinoids it is the precise ration of these capsaicinoids which causes the differences in taste reaction to different pepper species for example the typical delayed reaction to the habanero pepper  c chinense as compared to other species the scale or test is named after wilbur l scoville 18651942 who developed the scoville organoleptic test in 1912 while working at the parke davis pharmaceutical company as originally devised a solution of the pepper extract is diluted in sugar water until the heat is no longer detectable to a panel of usually five tasters the degree of dilution gives its measure on the scoville scale a sweet pepper that contains no capsaicin at all has a scoville rating of zero no heat detectable even undiluted whereas the hottest chillies such as habaneros have a rating of 300000 or more indicating that their extract has to be diluted 300000fold before the capsaicin present is undetectable the greatest weakness of the scoville organoleptic test is its imprecision because it relies on human subjectivity nowadays capsaicin concentrations are determined using more scientific methods typically high pressure liquid chromatography hplc the direct measurement of capsaicin gives much more accurate results than sensory methods the scoville rating or hotness of fresh chillies is obviously dependent upon the variety of pepper but even within one particular variety the hotness can vary greatly this is particularly so of the habaneros where a 10 fold variation is not uncommon factors influencing the heat of a fresh pepper include growing temperature hours of sunlight moisture soil chemistry and the type and amount of fertilizer used the heat of dried peppers is equally dependent upon all of these factors as it was growing plus the conditions under which it was dried until recently the guinness world records had the world’s hottest chilli pepper as the red savina habanero generally these peppers range from 350000–570000 scoville units as compared with a score of 2500–5000 for the jalapeno pepper the record breaking pepper was produced by gns spices inc in 1994 in walnut us and measured at 577000 scoville units recently however several superhot peppers have challenged for the record experts at the defence research laboratory in the army garrison town of tezpur in the northeastern state of assam claimed a locally grown naga jolokia in testing was nearly 50 per cent more pungent than the red savina habanero at a blistering 855000 scoville units however this remained unsubstantiated seeds of the same nagabih jolokia pepper sometimes also called the bhut jolokia cultivated at new mexico state university have stoodup to testing and in fenruary 2007 a specimen registering a staggering 1001304 scoville heat units was officially acclaimed by the guinness world record as the new worlds hottest pepper naga jolokia is nearly twice as hot as the previous holder the red savina the current hottest pepper reported and no 1 in the record books is the dragons breath chilli pepper developed in st asaph wales in association with nottingham trent university it has been tested at 248 million scoville units rest assured someone is already working on something hotterupdate pepper x bred by ed currie the creator of the famous carolina reaper chilli is claimed to measure in at 318 million scoville unitsas an aside the guinness world records site is altogether fascinating its all to easy to spend an hour exploring extraordinary facts that you wouldnt even imagine people would even report eg tallest celery plant  joan priednieks of weston zoyland somerset uk grew a celery plant that measured 274m 9ft tall in 1998 she bought the plant at a school fete in 1997 joan says the celery is too tough to eat
