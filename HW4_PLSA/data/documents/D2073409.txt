august 26 2005 by johnny review of dixon ticonderoga classic our review today comes from tom leininger a professional writer and photographer based in lafayette indiana tom also has a blog on which you can see some of his amazing photos we know that tom is a huge fan of the dixon ticonderoga so we asked him if he would review them for the revolution and we want to thank tom at the outset for a great review and wonderful photos the technical stuff material incense cedar shape hexagonal finish nontoxic yellow high gloss ferrule dixon’s famous green with yellow stripes eraser soft pink rubber core hb 2 graphite markings green foil “u s a dixon ticonderago 13882hb soft” packaging varies the box i have had 10 in it also available by the dozen and multidozen origin manufactured in usa of california cedar company is based in heathrow fla it was not until college that i understood how vital a pencil is to my chosen profession i was sitting in my first journalism class at western kentucky university when the professor said we should always carry a pencil with us or just use pencils all the time they work in the rain when ink runs they work in the cold when ink freezes so i have always had a pencil at hand i just never really wrote with them all the time until recently before i found this blog i had been trying to go back to the fountain pen i bought when i was in college i liked the fact it was messy and pretentious it must have gotten lost in all of my moves the disposable ones i tried did not always work since most of my writing is done in small notebooks standing up i needed something simple the pencil it was staring me in the face all along i always kept one in my car for when it rained or was extremely cold i thought this might be what i am looking for so i grabbed a generic one from the drawer at work but was disappointed a couple of people mentioned the pilot g2 mechanical which i tried these let me down coming home one day i found the rather patriotic box of dixon ticonderogas sitting on the desk my wife a former first grade teacher said they were best for her kids “i know you are reading about pencils” she said with a smirk “they are the best”so i sharpened one to a nice point unlike the mechanical one the lead does not break easily with pencils and keyboards i am a little on the rough side it works well writing in small notebooks standing up or crouching down on the ground i gave one to a pencil wielding editor at the newspaper i work at maybe it is even better when used at a desk “it’s a good pencil” he said it required one sharpening for a day’s worth of work the generic he had been using needed to be sharpened every five minutes he also noted that pencil has a more rounded feel to it it does not leave creases in your hand“another thing about that stupid pencil” he said leaving the office “it is strong and does not break”i have realized it can’t write on everything my hand or checks to be cashed for example at times it is not always easy to carry these would be the biggest drawbackws to the wooden pencil most of the time i will tuck it behind my ear leading to the phantom pencil syndrome at the end of the day i still think it is behind my ear when alas it is not luckily it tucks into my newswear chest vest and mountainsmith tour lumbar bag easily i do wish it came in a size that would fit a shirt pocket well sharpening is a breeze the point is solid they taste like wood the eraser works well and they can write on napkins what more could one ask for for one thing these are right handed pencils i am lefthanded so all of the printing is upside down when i am writing the dixon ticonderoga has earned a spot in my kit that is saying a lot since i am kind of picky all photos and text copyright t leininger 2005 share this like this like one blogger likes this pencil reviews photography
