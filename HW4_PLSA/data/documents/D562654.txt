hardwood product to the floor or use an engineered click hardwood that sits on top of an underlaymentpad i chose the latter known as a floating installation as it is modular and has the option to be disassembled if needed for replacing boards however the disadvantage to using an engineered hardwood is that the finished material is generally very thin and unlikely possible to be refinishedshare

floor below the tiles and is controllable with a wall mounted thermostat unless there is significant structural damage to the floor there is no risk based on dampness these are routinely used in bathrooms kitchens and laundry roomsshare improve this answeranswered jun 22 13 at 1848bib295k 8 47 861all currently produced thermostatic controllers for tile either have gfci protection built in or

foamrubber beneath the tile could help make it not so cold they make tile in all sorts of designs nowadays so you could even get tile that looks like wood if thats a design you like but if you have a cold slab under the floor thats a problem all its own that you can solve to provide numerous other benefits to your whole house are the edges insulated if not thats something you can do that will help quite a bit its too late to insulate under the slab but the sides are doableshare improve this answeranswered jan 19 14 at 1541i like dirt104k 7 29 67add a comment your answer sign up or log in sign
