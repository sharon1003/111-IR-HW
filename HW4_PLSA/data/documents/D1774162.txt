there are several ways to create a locale object regardless of the technique used creation can be as simple as specifying the language code however you can further distinguish the locale by setting the region also referred to as country and variant codes if you are using the jdk 7 release or later you can also specify the script code and unicode locale extensions the four ways to create a locale object are locale builder class locale constructors localefor language tag factory method locale constants version note the locale builder class and the for language tag method were added in the java se 7 release locale builder class the locale builder utility class can be used to construct a locale object that conforms to the ietf bcp 47 syntax for example to specify the french language and the country of canada you could invoke the locale builder constructor and then chain the setter methods as follows locale a locale  new locale builder set language frset region cabuild the next example creates locale objects for the english language in the united states and great britain locale b locale  new locale builder set language enset region usbuild  locale c locale  new locale builder set

tag string that conforms to the ietf bcp 47 standard you can use the for language tag string factory method which was introduced in the java se 7 release for example locale a locale  localefor

language code is either two or three lowercase letters that conform to the iso 639 standard you can find a full list of the iso 639 codes at httpwwwlocgovstandardsiso6392phpcodelistphp the following table lists a few of the language codes sample language codes language code descriptionde germanen englishfr frenchru russianja japanesejv javaneseko koreanzh chinese script code the script code begins with an uppercase letter followed by three lowercase letters and conforms to the iso 15924 standard you can find a full list of the iso 15924 codes at httpunicodeorgiso15924iso15924codeshtml the following table lists a few of the script codes sample script codes script code description arab arabic cyrl cyrillic kana katakana latn latin there are three methods for retrieving the script information for a localeget script  – returns the 4letter script code for a locale object if no script is defined for the locale an empty string is returnedget display script  – returns a name for the locales script that is appropriate for display to the user if possible the name will be localized for the default locale so for example if the script code is latn the diplay script name returned would be the string latin for an english language localeget display script locale – returns the display name of the specified locale localized if possible for the locale region code the region country code consists of either two or three uppercase letters that conform to the iso 3166 standard or three numbers that conform to the un m49 standard a copy of the codes can be found at

can be used to further distinguish your locale for example the variant code can be used to indicate dialectical differences that are not covered by the region code version note prior to the java se 7 release the variant code was sometimes used to identify differences that were not specific to the language or region for example it might have been used to identify differences between computing platforms such as windows or unix under the ietf bcp 47 standard this use is discouraged to define nonlanguagespecific variations relevant to your environment use the extensions mechanism as explained in bcp 47 extensions  as of the java se 7 release which conforms to the ietf bcp 47 standard the variant code is used specifically to indicate additional variations that define a language or its dialects the ietf bcp 47 standard imposes syntactic restrictions on the variant subtag you can see a list of variant codes search for variant at httpwwwianaorgassignmentslanguagesubtagregistry for example java se uses the variant code to support the thai language by convention a number format object for the th and thth locales will use common arabic digit shapes or arabic numerals to format thai numbers however a number format for the ththth locale uses thai digit shapes the excerpt from thai digitsjava demonstrates this string output string  new string  locale  thai locale   new locale
