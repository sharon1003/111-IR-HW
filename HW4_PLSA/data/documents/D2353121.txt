first drive first drive 2017 honda civic hatchback sport online content 1 comment return of the hatch many people won’t miss something until it is gone honda offered its broadly popular civic model as a hatchback since the first generation civic was available in the early 1970s the hatchback proved popular all the way through the 1990s the seventh generation hatchback 200105 was the last to be offered in the us while europe japan and other markets continued to get the hatchback for the next two generations it became apparent that america was starting to miss the odd numbered door text by richard fong  photos by richard fong and courtesy of american honda building a better body for the 2017 model year the hatchback rejoins the civic family the civic hatchback project was headed up by design chief engineer hideki matsumoto based on honda’s allnew global platform engineers increased the torsional stiffness of the new hatchback by 52percent while reducing the weight of the chassis by 62 pounds compared to the previous civic hatchback designed with lightweight high rigidity low center of gravity and low inertia in mind this effort lends itself to the civic’s handling feel fuel efficiency and performance enhanced packages although the new civic hatchback already hit showrooms in late september of 2016 with three trim package options lx ex exl the new sport and sport touring trims are not due for release until the first quarter of 2017 the sport trim springboards from the base lx package while the sport touring trim carries the exl to the next level the hatchback is available in six different hues with the sport and sport touring packages also available in an exclusive sonic gray pearl finish unlike the sedan the hatchback also features a twopart urethane clear coat intended to deliver a thicker clear coat layer that exhibits a european quality finish we take a closer look at the sport and sport touring models in this first drive review lx mt 19700  cvt

coupe and sedan released earlier this year the twotier instrument cluster of the previous generation civic has been abandoned in favor of a traditional consolidated gauge cluster the ergonomics of the rest of the cabin are nothing less than one would expect of a honda the control surfaces lay within easy reach and offered the typical refinements that one would expect of the civic including automatic climate control bluetooth wireless interface and an overall solid fit and finish a consolemounted electronic parking brake lends to the rich feel of the civic in addition to options like remote start and honda sensing™ my only real gripe would be the cheap plastic feel of the steering wheel controls the previous model had velvety soft touch surfaces on all of the buttons whereas the new controls are clear plastic and just don’t feel as refined the first factory turbocharged honda the tenth generation civic is the first hondabadged vehicle to feature a turbocharged engine it’s no secret that honda has always embraced natural aspiration and in doing so has released innovations like variable valve timing and lift control for both performance and fuel economy applications but the changing times and the demand for even greater fuel efficiency called for a shift in design philosophy development of a small displacement direct injection forced induction engine led to the introduction of the turbocharged l15b engine honda challenged its powertrain development lead toshikatsu takanohashi to deliver an efficient powerplant that still produced enough power to make the civic a fun car to drive in the design of the 15liter l15b engine he achieved just that with a bore of 73mm and a stroke of 894mm the l15b features a smaller bore and a longer stroke than the b18c1 vtec engine that powered the integra gsr of the 1990s yet this new engine with direct injection and forced induction produces 180 horsepower as equipped in the 6speed manual civic hatchback sport like the gsr with an additional 49 lbft torque over the b18c totaling 177 lbft three pedals and six gears another welcome feature of the civic hatchback sport is the return of a traditional manual transmission the civic coupe and sedan come standard with the cvt transmission with exception of the nonturbocharged lx model and the turbocharged ext the 2017 civic hatchback lx and sport are offered with a sixspeed manual 6mt transmission as standard when equipped with the 6mt the hatchback sport gains 6 horsepower and 15 lbft torque compared to the cvtequipped models proving grounds northern california american honda invited us to test out the new civic hatchback in both the sport and sport touring trims in scenic northern california our drive route took us from the heart of downtown san francisco through santa cruz and down to the coastal city of monterey our drive started behind the wheel of the 6mt civic hatchback sport the view from the driver’s seat offered a clear field of vision one noteworthy observation was how refined the aerodynamics of the civic have become the only perceptible wind noise came from the side mirrors this made hearing the engine easier although there was no perceptible exhaust note coming from the sport’s center exit exhaust it’s so refreshing that honda hadn’t lost sight of the enthusiast driver interested in choosing his or her own gears and when to engagedisengage the transmission from the engine the new l15b engine delivered a very smooth and linear power band offering good response at lowtomid engine speeds with decent peak output although the civic’s clutch felt a little too dampened for my personal taste it definitely helps to smooth clutch engagement in the case of bumpertobumper driving for the novice manual transmission driver it would certainly help to prevent lurchy starts in first gear or jerky transitions between gears prndrive my first experience driving honda’s early foray with continuously variable transmissions cvt was in my sister’s 2003 civic hybrid that car pretty much dampened my expectations of having fun driving a cvt equipped vehicle however more than a decade of experience paired with a turbocharged engine helped to put those reservations to rest taking the cvtequipped civic hatchback sport touring model up to highway speed at wide open throttle was not as thrilling as it was with the 6mt but it did not leave us wanting as merging into traffic proved an easy task although the cvt does not contain specific gear ratios manually shifting the sport touring model’s paddle shifters permitted an experience similar to a traditional slush box with defined gears enjoy the ride beyond the l15b engine’s turbocharged horsepower and 42 mpg combined mileage rating the civic hatchback sport’s slightly more aggressive 211 locktolock steering ratio combined with its standard mac pherson strut frontmultilink rear suspension offers a comfortable ride while minimizing body roll through even the most aggressive turns although the lateral support from the seats leaves a little to be desired they’re comfortable and can accommodate a variety of passenger body types seating for four within the hatchback with room for luggage in the 257 cubic foot cargo area is no problem a fifth passenger could squeeze in but it won’t be as comfy especially on a longer drive although the side profile of the civic hatchback is almost indiscernible compared to the civic sedan it’s nice to see the return of the hatchback in a time when european hot hatches are the rage civic honda previous
