the startalkendorsed principles describe characteristics of highly effective language teaching and learning an ideal learning experience is framed by a standardsbased and thematically organized curriculum that integrates culture content and language learners work with authentic ageappropriate texts in a learnercentered environment as they engage in realworld performance tasks that allow them to use the target language beyond the classroom implementing a standardsbased and thematically organized curriculum the thematic unit is standardsbased the content is cognitively engaging and relevant to the learner every unit assesses a student’s increasing ability to use language for realworld purposes each lesson supports the goals of the unit by having clearly stated learning targets that indicate what students will know and be able to do by the end of the lesson lesson design is research based and learning experiences are sequenced in ways that allow for maximum student learning grammar is not the focus of the course unit or lesson the teacher teaches grammar as a tool for communication avoiding meaningless rote drills and ensuring that all practice requires attention to meaning facilitating a learnercentered classroom example ataglance pdfthe teacher acts as a partner with students in the learning process providing input and modeling output guiding and enabling cognitive processing facilitating collaborative practice and giving feedback to develop independent student language performance the teacher engages learners in cognitively challenging realworld tasks examples the teacher provides multiple opportunities for learners to collaborate in pair and small group activities while interpreting and expressing ideas about topics of interest to them there is frequent studenttostudent interaction the teacher makes instructional decisions based on learner’s performance and allows for ongoing feedback from a variety of sources to improve learner’s performance using the target language and providing comprehensible input for instruction example the teacher uses the target language at least 90 percent of the time examples the teacher demonstrates and models to make input comprehensible students learn vocabulary from using it in languagerich contexts such as stories handson experiences picture descriptions or subjectmatter content examples the teacher uses a variety of strategies to make language comprehensible monitors student comprehension and makes adjustments as necessary examples the teacher avoids the use of translation by using verbal and nonverbal strategies and also avoids eliciting translation from students integrating culture content and language in a world language classroom example ataglance pdflearners acquire cultural knowledge and insights as they consider and reflect on the relationships among the products practices and perspectives of the cultures being studied contentrelated instruction allows learners to make meaningful connections to the world around them learners build reinforce and expand their knowledge of other disciplines and the world while using the target language learning experiences are designed to allow students to use language as they work with the content and cultural topics of the unit learners engage in meaningful and purposeful communication they communicate they know how when and why to say what to whom adapting and using ageappropriate authentic materials the teacher uses authentic materials and designs tasks appropriate to the language proficiency and age level of the learners the teacher uses a variety of authentic print and nonprint materials conducting performancebased assessment the teacher uses formative checks for learning during lessons to adjust instruction as needed and to provide timely feedback to learners learners know how well they are doing with regard to specific learning goals and they know what they can do to improve their performance learners have the ability to assess their own learning learners engage in summative realworld performance tasks to demonstrate how well they have met the performance goals of the unit the bulleted lists of characteristics provide guidance for reflecting on observed lessons they focus exclusively on world languagespecific behaviors and do not include critical but more generic characteristics of effective instruction eg time management and engaging all learners the complete list starting with the end in mind planning and evaluating highly successful world language programs r couet g duncan j eddy m met m smith m still  a tollefson 2008 is available from pearson education
