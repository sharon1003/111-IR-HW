of customers to resolve disputes with the bank through the typical legal process afforded citizens of the united states current wells fargo customers tacitly or knowingly agreed to sign away these rights in favor of an arbitration system that favors wealthy corporations although i wrote about the change on consumerism commentary changes like these go largely unnoticed and don’t get a lot of attention in the media even from consumerfocused outlets banking deal earn 175 apy on an fdicinsured money market account at cit bank to be honest i still have personal and business accounts at wells
