hand at the toughest solves ever by ben blatt i n a recent episode of wheel of fortune contestant emil de leon accomplished what host pat sajak would later describe on twitter as the “most amazing solve in my 30 years on the show” de leon was able to complete the game’s final puzzle—the category was “thing”—with only two letters to go on “ne         ” with his first guess he blurted out “new baby buggy”—which turned out to be the improbable answer its become a slate tradition to overanalyze game shows and de leon’s triumph inspired me to turn my attention to wheel of fortune i wondered is

solved the bonus round puzzle new baby buggy with just the n and e to help him guess in honor of his achievement slate presents a quiz consisting of the 15 greatest solves in the history of wheel of fortune how will you fare press enter to begin share score share score advertisement a word about my process my analysis is limited in its scope by the solutions recorded on the wheel of fortune bonus puzzle compendium and this puzzle archive neither of which is complete but combined the two sites have recorded almost 13000 puzzles from the game show’s opening rounds and over 2000 bonusround puzzles going back intermittently to 1988 both of these sites are maintained by viewers and there is no official record keeping for the show so my analysis is dependent on the accuracy of these committed wheel of fortune superfans that said—they seem very committed as regular wheel watchers know the bonus round in which emil’s triumph occurred operates somewhat differently than the regular rounds of play since a rule change in 1988 contestants have been given the letters rstlne automatically they are then allowed to guess three additional consonants and one additional vowel this should be great news for contestants as rstlne represent approximately 45 percent of all letters in a standard english text however of the more than 22000 letters in the wheel of fortune bonus puzzles in my sample rstlne only account for 296 percent of all letters—a statistically significant discrepancy for obvious reasons the show’s producers seem to be choosing words and phrases that are light on rstlne at least in the bonus round during the regular rounds rstlne show up about as often as you’d expect them to in my sample the total frequency of rstlne was 447 percent very close to the 449 percent you’d expect from the english language writ large after rstlne are revealed in the bonus round a player gets to request his four additional letters the n and the e that showed up in emil’s puzzle obviously came from the free letters every contestant is given for his additional letters he chose h m d and o netting him no additional letters in the puzzle was emil unwise to pick h m d and o advertisement if emil were to pick letters purely by their frequency in the english language he should have guessed h d c and a instead of h d m and o but the difference in frequency between m and c or a and o is not huge—at least in real life recall however that bonus round answers do not have the same letter frequency you find in the english language the three consonants and one vowel that show up most frequently in the bonus round are h g b and o picking h g b and o in all past rounds would have netted contestants 3 percent more letters revealed than picking h d c and a this is useful information for contestants o is usually the fourth most popular letter in the language with a frequency of 75 percent but it has a frequency of over 96 percent in the universe of wheel of fortune bonus rounds even if you split the bonus round sample chronologically into five equal samples of 400 puzzles in order to test for random blips over time o is the most popular letter in every sample the fact that o appears more frequently than letters that usually best it—like e t or a—suggests its high frequency is likely not random historically if all bonusround contestants had guessed the combination of hgbo at every opportunity the four letters would have revealed 225 percent of all bonus round letters in reality however contestants rarely guess hgbo—and sometimes they guess strange combinations of unlikely letters like pkwi or zjwi based on each letter’s frequency in the bonus round statistics would suggest that their guesses should have revealed only 185 percent of all letters however contestants’ guesses have actually revealed 219 percent of all letters not far off from the 225 percent my hgbo advice would yield it appears contestants are making educated guesses based on what rstlne has already indicated about a given puzzle that said every letter counts de leon came up empty with his guess of hdmo if he had guessed my grouping of hgbo he’d have been looking at this ne bb bgg ultimately he didn’t need the help but for most contestants those letters might have been the difference between winning 45000 or going home emptyhanded advertisement maximizing the number of letters revealed greatly increases your chances of winning the chart below plots the percentage of total letters revealed either by player guess or by rstlne along the xaxis against the win percentage of players on the yaxis for example contestants who have revealed 75 percent of a puzzle’s letters when the final countdown starts players have 10 seconds to solve the bonus round puzzle with unlimited guesses go on to guess the correct answer 83 percent of the time even a mediocre wheel player can likely solve something like b u s r  u t e when emil was presented with “ne         ” roughly 17 percent of all the letters in the phrase were visible only about 30 people had been in a similar position to emil’s—that is with less than 20 percent of all letters revealed—and none of them had ever managed to win again my analysis is based on the available data which has some holes in it and doesn’t date all the way back to the show’s debut in 1975 but based on my sample it’s safe to say that de leon’s probably is the most amazing solve ever from a statistical perspective when you consider that “new baby buggy” is a phrase few people have ever heard let alone would offer up as a guess were they in emil’s shoes the guess is even more remarkable top comment the interactive quiz was a fun feature but without letting us see the category and the guessed letters before the timer starts which actual contestants would already know its all but impossible to solve the puzzles morefez join in curious to see if you have the solving skills to crack a puzzle like emil’s the quiz above includes puzzles from the 15 bonus rounds out of over 2000 in my sample in which the fewest number of letters were revealed but the contestant still managed to guess the correct answer armed with the same letters see if you can solve these puzzles in that short 10second window go lccorrection march 27 2014 several puzzles in this articles interactive feature did not include some given letters such as r or t or offered an incorrect letter such as c instead of g this has been fixed ben blatt is a slate contributor and author of nabokov’s favorite word is mauve follow him on twitter
