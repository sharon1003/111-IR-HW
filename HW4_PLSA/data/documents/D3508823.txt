the search for a studio management system the back office work required to run a photography business can be quite taxing from tracking leads to creating contracts to sending invoices the list of tasks goes on and on…i was in the same boat as many of you find yourself in now or may find yourself in in the future i was using multiple systems google docs spreadsheets third party apps to track our inquiries contracts invoices dates available etc i wanted to find a studio management system that would do the majority of this work i began the journey to find a solution in a naive way i had a loose set of requirements in my head that i planned to make sure the solution i chose would satisfy it quickly became obvious that to accomplish the task at hand i was going to need to solidify and write down what it was exactly that i required in a solution the key word being required sure bells and whistles are nice but at the end of the day they don’t necessarily contribute to the end goal reducing time spent on back office tasks requirements here are the requirements i set your mileage may vary…branding stable platform uptime implementation stack etclead generation able to embed

of workflow management systems as long as they had a free trial and from an outward appearance looked like they might be a possible solution i gave them a try i even paid to test one workflow management system lesson learned testing was a daunting time consuming task i knew each time that i tested a workflow management system that i would most likely be doing a setup process that ultimately would be thrown away if i did not use that system during my testing i found a common theme on a number of the platforms i tried they seemed to have issues doing the simple basic required tasks the development that was going on was focusing on new bells and whistles if you do not have a solid foundation in the basic tasks you can have all the bells and whistles in the world and they don’t mean squat on my journey i tested 17hats pixifi sprout studio and táve i ended up choosing táve  even after paying for a 2 year subscription to another solution why let me explain how táve fulfilled each of my requirements1 branding some might think this is a minor issue but as a business i want to offer a consistent customer experience i didn’t spend good money working with a graphic designer to come up with our brand to not be able to use that in everything we do our brand should translate over to our lead generation forms client portal contracts etc táve allows for this customization throughout the application you are able to setup táve in such a way that the client does not know they left your website you are able to use a custom domain allowing you to setup something like “clientsyourdomaincom” it may seem simple but i feel it goes along way in keeping your clients trust2 stable platform uptime implementation stack etchaving an extensive it background i wanted a product that was implemented in the cloud offering high availability and great performance that is exactly what táve offers táve utilizes amazon’s aws cloud infrastructure ensuring a stable backend system they have hot standby implemented in oregon which you can access at any time should the unthinkable happen to the primary servers hosted in aws located in virginia the standby hosts provide a readonly version of the data and can be reached at standbytavecom you can check the system uptime status by going to statustavecom táve has been around for 8 years and is a stable solid platform3 lead generation táve provides the ability to embed a custom contact form on your website that feeds directly into the system you can also utilize some third party contact form plugins to accomplish this as well for those who are more skilled with web technologies táve provides the ability to supply your own custom css to manipulate the look and feel of the contact form s if you are not familiar with this you can search the táve facebook user group or the internet for some examples of what other folks have done to modify their forms i was able to use our font and colors to keep a consistent look with our branding customized lead form4 contact management fed by lead generation or manual entrytáve provides standard contact management capabilities as well as the ability to add custom fields that are meaningful to you some of these fields can be populated by the lead generation form s for our initial email response back to a perspective client i like to have the finance’s name i added this as a custom field even though there is a separate section to fill in their information i set up a custom field on táve to capture this and i added that field to our contact form then from the start i can begin referring to couple by name in all correspondence5 quotes and contracts táve provides the capability to create a seamless quote contract invoice and payment schedule process you can create a quote with multiple options based on the products and packages you offer and allow the client to choose what they want that information can then be populated over in the contract dynamically once the quote is accepted and contract signed invoice s can be generated based on the selected information allowing the whole process to be fluid and require the least amount of work for you on the backend our process is a little different than that used by others i do not send out a quote with options for the client to choose from we meet with our clients and from that meeting we know what collection they would like to move forward with once we are given the go ahead i create a quote with the options they chose generate a contract with their specific information and choices and send that to them electronically táve allows us to do this in a timely manner while setting up táve i created contracts that include the details of each of the types of collections we offer i can generate a unique one for each client and send it to them in a few minutes you also have the ability to proofreadview it before it is sent contracts capture an electronic signature of both the client and your business i have it set up that once they sign it and pay their invoice that we then sign it in certain parts of our contracts the client’s initials are required táve provides this capability as well6 invoicing and payment schedules keeping the amount of time spent doing backend business processes to a minimum allows you to spend that time on areas that make your business more profitable taking photographs i wanted an invoicing system that fed off of the rest of the system where applicable it should pull from as many places in the system as possible to keep my input to a minimum táve provides the ability to generate invoices based on the quote and payment schedule there are prebuilt payment schedules and you can also create your own custom schedules while importing existing contracts into táve i had to create a few custom payment schedules to match the payment terms from those contracts it was simple and intuitive to do7 questionnaires create my own reusable questionnairesprior to selecting táve i was using a free product to send out our questionnaires this was in a separate application and did not have the same look and feel as the rest of our customer experience táve provides the ability to create very detailed questionnaires that are user friendly on the client side calendar popups sliders drop downs etc are just a few of the user input types offered creating or updating questionnaires is a simple drag and drop process the questionnaires can be set to editable for a given time frame to allow the client enough time to fill them in or come back and update them clients have access to them via their client portal or via a direct link8 client portal should be user friendly contain questionnaires contracts invoices etcputting myself in the clients shoes i know i would want a single place to go for all of the information pertaining to the photographer i chose the client portal is that solution for each of your clients you have the ability to enabledisable the client portal by default its set to disabled once enabled you can email the portal link to your client and they will be able to set their password during the initial login afterwards they can return as often as they like the portal contains things such as contracts invoices questionnaires etc they can update their contact info as well9 email integration should integrate to some degree with my current email systemtáve provides the ability to send emails from inside the system they are sent out from táve with your email address as the reply to if you send emails from within táve then táve provides tracking details such as when the email was opened you can also send an email from your own email client and have the same tracking details as long as you bcc your táve tracking email address email replies sent to you can also be forwarded to this bcc address and then you can associate them with the correct job you have the ability to create a signature that is applied to each email you can also create canned responses or as táve calls them quick responses these are awesome and make responding to clients a quick and painless process you can even use tokens to substitute information on the fly that pertains to your client like name dates etc10 calendar must play nice with google calendarthe calendar capability of táve is quite impressive each job type can have a different color to make them standout and easily recognizable on the calendar there are a number of calendar shortcuts listed under the calendar icon that help show you a small or larger path of items day week month 36 month each user’s events etc each calendar can be subscribed to by an external source this is how you can show your táve calendar items on your google calendar you can also have a táve calendar subscribe to an external calendar as well when a lead comes in its automatically noted on the calendar you assigned for that job type as a pending item if a lead comes in that conflicts with an existing job its noted with a red exclamation point11 customer support the first thing i noticed was the amount of online documentation available for new users to get setup and running they provided a startup guide detailing an approach to setup that makes sense each piece builds off of the next and would enable you to get the basic items setup in the system so you could start using it right away if you run into any issues you can send a message to support i found that my questions were always answered with in 24 hours most of the time with in a few hours this goes a long way it was great to see that the folks behind the product actually used it themselves in their businesses they provided practical examples and advice while attending wppi 2016 in las vegas i had the pleasure of meeting with topher it was great to get to talk in person and provide feedback on the product in conclusion táve met each of the items i set as criteria t he 30 day free trial 60 days if you use my referral link provided an adequate amount of time for me to work through the setup guide and test things along the way i created plenty of test leads and progressed through the system as if i was the client this allowed me to see and test things from their point of view i wanted to be certain what the client experience would be first time setup of a system like this can be overwhelming if it seems like too much work take baby steps good things take time and the pay off will be huge follow the setup guide  httpsupporttavecomdocumentationgettingstarted  also make sure you
