return to their country farm 22 rileys mother was able to keep peace in the family but after her death in august from heart disease riley and his father had a final break he blamed his mothers death

apprenticeship to a painter he completed the study and opened a business in greenfield creating and maintaining signs his earliest known poems are verses he wrote as clever advertisements for his customers 26riley began participating in local theater productions with the adelphians to earn extra income and during the winter months when the demand for painting declined riley began writing poetry which he mailed to his brother living in indianapolis his brother acted as his agent and offered the poems to the newspaper indianapolis mirror for free his first poem was featured on march 30

joined the act as a huckster calling himself the painter poet he traveled with the act composing poetry and performing at the shows 30 31 after his act he sold tonics to his audience sometimes employing dishonesty during one stop riley presented himself as a formerly blind painter who had been cured by a tonic using himself as evidence to encourage the audience to purchase his product 32riley began sending poems to his brother again in february 1873 about the same time he and several friends began an advertisement company 33 the men traveled around indiana creating large billboardlike signs on the sides of buildings and barns and in high places that would be visible from a distance 34 the company was financially successful but riley was continually drawn to poetry in october he traveled to south bend where he took a job at stockford  blowney painting verses on signs for a month the short duration of his job may have been due to his frequent drunkenness at that time 35in early 1874 riley returned to greenfield to become a writer fulltime 36 in february he submitted a poem entitled at last to the danbury news a connecticut newspaper 37 the editors accepted his poem paid him for it and wrote him a letter encouraging him to submit more riley found the note and his first payment inspiring 38 he began submitting poems regularly to the editors 39 but after the newspaper shut down in 1875 riley was left without a paying publisher he began traveling and performing with the adelphians around central indiana to earn an income while he searched for a new publisher in august 1875 he joined another traveling tonic show run by the wizard oil company 40 n 2early career  editnewspaper work  editriley began sending correspondence to the famous american poet henry wadsworth longfellow during late 1875 seeking his endorsement to help him start a career as a poet 41 he submitted many poems to longfellow whom he considered to be the greatest living poet not receiving a prompt response he sent similar letters to john townsend trowbridge and several other prominent writers asking for an endorsement 42 longfellow finally replied in a brief letter telling riley that i have read the poems in great pleasure and think they show a true poetic faculty and insight 43 44 riley carried the letter with him everywhere and hoping to receive a job offer and to create a market for his poetry he began sending poems to dozens of newspapers touting longfellows endorsement among the newspapers to take an interest in the poems was the indianapolis journal a major republican party metropolitan newspaper in indiana among the first poems the newspaper purchased from riley were song of the new year an empty nest and a short story entitled a remarkable man 45the editors of the anderson democrat discovered rileys poems in the indianapolis journal and offered him a job as a reporter in february 1877 46 47 riley accepted he worked as a normal reporter gathering local news writing articles and assisting in setting the typecast on the printing press he continued to write poems regularly for the newspaper and to sell other poems to larger newspapers 48 during the year riley spent working in anderson he met and began to court edora mysers the couple became engaged but terminated the relationship after they decided against marriage in august 49after a rejection of his poems by an eastern periodical riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality and that it was being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east riley authored a poem imitating the style of edgar allan poe and submitted it to the kokomo dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost poe poem the dispatch published the poem and reported it as such 50 51 riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in chicago boston and new york to gauge their reaction they were disappointed while a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic the majority did not claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by poe 52 an employee of the dispatch learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the kokomo tribune which published an expose that outed riley as a conspirator behind the hoax the revelation damaged the credibility of the dispatch and harmed rileys reputation 53 54in the aftermath of the poe plot riley was dismissed from the democrat so he returned to greenfield to spend time writing poetry 55 back home he met clara louise bottsford a school teacher boarding in his fathers home they found they had much in common particularly their love of literature the couple began a twelveyear intermittent relationship which would be rileys longest lasting 56 in mid1878 the couple had their first breakup caused partly by rileys alcohol addiction the event led riley to make his first attempt to give up liquor he joined a local temperance organization but quit after a few weeks 57performing poet  editwithout a steady income his financial situation began to deteriorate he began submitting his poems to more prominent literary magazines including scribners monthly but was informed that although he showed promise his work was still short of the standards required for use in their publications 58 59 locally he was still dealing with the stigma of the poe plot the indianapolis journal and other newspapers refused to accept his poetry leaving riley desperate for income in january 1878 on the advice of a friend riley paid an entrance fee to join a traveling lecture circuit where he could give poetry readings in exchange he received a portion of the profit his performances earned such circuits were popular at the time and riley quickly earned a local reputation for his entertaining readings 60in august 1878 riley followed indiana governor james d williams as speaker at a civic event in a small town near indianapolis he recited a recently composed poem a childhood home of long ago telling of life in pioneer indiana the poem was well received and was given good reviews by several newspapers 61flying islands of the night is the only play that riley wrote and published authored while riley was traveling with the adelphians but never performed the play has similarities to a midsummer nights dream which riley may have used as a model 62 flying islands concerns a kingdom besieged by evil forces of a sinister queen who is defeated eventually by an angellike heroine 63 most reviews were positive riley published the play and it became popular in the central indiana area during late 1878 helping riley to convince newspapers to again accept his poetry in november 1879 he was offered a position as a columnist at the indianapolis journal and accepted after being encouraged by e b matindale the papers chief editor 64although the play and his newspaper work helped expose him to a wider audience the chief source of his increasing popularity was his performances on the lecture circuit he made both dramatic and comedic readings of his poetry and by early 1879 could guarantee large crowds whenever he performed 65 in an 1894 article hamlin garland wrote that rileys celebrity resulted from his reading talent saying his vibrant individual voice his flexible lips his droll glance united to make him at once poet and comedian—comedian in the sense in which makes for tears as well as for laughter 66 although he was a good performer his acts were not entirely original in style he frequently copied practices developed by samuel clemens and will carleton 67 his tour in 1880 took him to every city in indiana where he was introduced by local dignitaries and other popular figures including maurice thompson with whom he began to develop a close friendship 68developing and maintaining his publicity became a constant job and received more of his attention as his fame grew keeping his alcohol addiction secret maintaining the persona of a simple rural poet and a friendly common person became most important 69 riley identified these traits as the basis of his popularity during the mid1880s and wrote of his need to maintain a fictional persona 67 he encouraged the stereotype by authoring poetry he thought would help build his identity he was aided by editorials he authored and submitted to the indianapolis journal offering observations on events from his perspective as a humble rural poet 70 he changed his appearance to look more mainstream and began by shaving his mustache off and abandoning the flamboyant dress he employed in his early circuit tours 71by 1880 his poems were beginning to be published nationally and were receiving positive reviews tom johnsons quit was carried by newspapers in twenty states thanks in part to the careful cultivation of his popularity 70 riley became frustrated that despite his growing acclaim he found it difficult to achieve financial success 72 in the early 1880s in addition to his steady performing riley began producing many poems to increase his income half of his poems were written during the period the constant labor had adverse effects on his health which was worsened by his drinking at the urging of maurice thompson he again attempted to stop drinking liquor but was only able to give it up for a few months 73indianapolis journal  editnewspaper poet  editriley moved to indianapolis at the end of 1879 to begin his employment with the journal it was the only metropolitan newspaper in indianapolis with daily editions and had wide readership for the newspaper he wrote a regular society column that often included verses of poetry 74 75 thereafter riley met many prominent people and began a close friendship with eugene v debs 76 debs enjoyed rileys works and often complimented his sentiments 77 riley had been using the pseudonym jay whit since he started authoring poetry but finally began to write under his own name in april 1881 78riley renewed his relationship with bottsford in 1880 and the two corresponded frequently their relationship remained unstable but riley became deeply attached to her she inspired his poem the werewife which told of a perfect wife who could suddenly become a demonic monster 79 bottsford pressed riley for marriage several times but riley refused 80 they broke off their relationship a second time in 1881 when she discovered his correspondence with two other women 81 and found that he had taken a secret vacation to wisconsin with one of them 82rileys alcohol addiction influenced some of his poems during his time working for the journal including on quitting california john gollihers third womern  sic and the dismal fate of tit each made references to the delirium caused by drinking 83 although riley rarely published anything controversial some of his poems published from the same period including afterwhiles allude to drug usage and make vague sexual references 84 during the early 1880s riley still made submissions to the elite literary periodicals but continued to be rejected riley found the rejection discouraging but persevered he believed he would never be recognized as a true literary figure until one of the prestigious periodicals published his work 85lyceum circuit  editriley made occasional reading tours around indiana and in august 1880 was invited to perform at asbury university his performance there so impressed the local phi kappa psi chapter he was invited to join as an honorary member 86 through the fraternity he met robert jones burdette a writer and minister in the indianapolis area burdette was a member of the redpath lyceum bureau of boston a prominent lecture circuit whose regular speakers included ralph waldo emerson 87 burdette encouraged riley to join the circuit through its chicago branch 88 rileys accumulated debt and low income began causing him trouble in 1881 and he decided rejoining a lecture circuit would provide much needed funds 89 his agreement for continued employment with the circuit depended on his ability to draw audiences during the first season beginning in april 1881 he succeeded drawing the largest crowds in chicago and indianapolis 90because of his success in the midwest the circuit leaders invited him to make an east coast tour starting in boston at the tremont temple in february 1882 91 riley agreed signing a tenyear agreement and granting half his receipts to his agent 92 before his performance he traveled to longfellows home in massachusetts and convinced him to agree to a meeting their brief meeting was one of rileys fondest memories and he wrote a lengthy article on it after longfellows death only a month later 93 94 longfellow encouraged riley to focus on poetry and gave him advice for his upcoming performance at the performance riley was well received and his poems were greeted with laughter and given praise in the citys newspaper reviews 95 96 boston was the literary center of the united states at the time and rileys impression on the citys literary community helped him finally to get his work accepted by prestigious periodicals the century magazine was the first such periodical to accept his work running in swimmingtime in its september 1883 issue 97 until the 1890s it remained the only major literary magazine to publish rileys work knowing the high standards of the magazine riley reserved his best work each year to submit including one of his favorites the old man and jim in 1887 98by the end of 1882 rileys finances began to improve dramatically thanks largely to the income from his performances 99 during 1883 he began writing his boone county poems by the pseudonym benjamin f johnson of boone the poems were almost entirely written in dialect and emphasized topics of rural life during the early nineteenth century often employing nostalgia and the simplicity of country life as elements the old swimminhole and when the frost is on the punkin were the most popular and helped earn the entire series critical acclaim the topics were popular with readers reminding many of them of their childhood 100 merrill meigs  company later renamed bobbsmerrill company approached riley to compile the poems into a book riley agreed and printing of his first book began in august 1883 titled the old swimminhole and leven more poems the books popularity necessitated a second printing before the end of the year 101 during this period riley determined that his most popular poems were those on topics of rural life and he began to use that as a common theme throughout his future work 102the income from rileys book allowed him to ease his busy work schedule he submitted articles to the journal less frequently and made fewer lecture stops his poems became fewer but the quality of his poetry improved he wrote his most famous poems during the mid1880s including little orphant annie  sic  103 riley attempted to secure a new job at a periodical and leave the journal but the magazines to which he submitted would not hire him unless he was willing to relocate riley was steadfast in his refusal to leave indiana and told reporters that his rural home was his inspiration and to leave would ruin his poetry 104riley renewed his relationship with bottsworth for a third and final time in 1883 the two corresponded frequently and had secret lovers rendezvous he stopped visiting other women and their relationship became more dedicated and stable 105 bottsworth however became convinced riley was seeing another woman and they terminated their relationship in january 1885 106 rileys sister mary had become a close friend of bottsworth and scolded him for his mistreatment of her her reputation was tarnished by the affair and she found it difficult to find employment once their relationship ended 107in 1884 riley made another tour of the major cities in the eastern united states 108 following the lectures he began compiling a second book of poetry he completed it during july and bowenmerrill published it in december with the title the boss girl a christmas story and other sketches 109 the book which contained humorous poetry and short stories received mixed reviews it was popular around indiana where the majority of its copies were sold one reviewer however called the poems weird nightmarish and eerie and compared them to edgar allan poes works 110 111while riley was working on his book he was unexpectedly invited by james b pond the agent for many of the nations major performers to join a onehundred nights engagement in new york city in a show that included samuel clemens and dudley warner 112 riley however was unable to agree with the redpath bureau who had to authorize any other performance under the terms of their contract riley believed his contract with redpath bureau was limiting his opportunities and his relationship with his agent became strained 113 114western association of writers  editdue partly to the limited success of his latest book outside indiana riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to attempt to form an association to promote their work popular indiana writer lew wallace author of benhur was a major promoter of the effort 115 during 1885 more than one hundred writers joined the group they held their first meeting in july naming themselves the western association of writers at the meeting maurice thompson was named president and riley vice president 116 the association never succeeded in its goals of creating a powerful advertising force but became a social club and a rival literary community to the eastern writing establishment riley was disappointed with the shortcomings of the group but came to depend on its regular meetings as a escape from his normally hectic schedule 117through the association riley became acquainted with most of the notable writers in the midwestern united states including humorist edgar wilson nye of chicago after completing his lecture circuit in 1885 riley formed a partnership with nye and his agent to begin a new tour the redpath bureau agreed to allow riley to tour with nye provided he maintained his financial agreements with them 118 in addition to touring riley and nye collaborated to write a book nye and rileys railway guide a collection of humorous anecdotes and poems intended to parody popular tourist literature of the day published in 1888 the book was somewhat successful and had three reprints 98in october 1887 riley and the association joined with other writers to petition the united states congress to attempt to negotiate international treaties to protect american copyrights abroad the group became known as the international copyright league and had significant success in its efforts when traveling to one of the leagues meetings in new york city that year riley was struck by bells palsy he recovered after three weeks but remained secluded to hide the effects of the sickness which he believed was caused by his alcohol addiction he made another attempt to stop drinking alcohol with the help of a minister but again soon returned to his old habit 119after recovering riley remained briefly in new york to participate in a show at chickering hall with edgar nye samuel clemens and several others riley was introduced by james russell lowell before his performance and lowell gave riley a glowing endorsement to the crowd rileys poetry brought both tears and laughter according to the new york sun critic edmund clarence stedman one of the foremost literary critics of the era was present and wrote that rileys dialect poems were the finest he had ever heard in which a homely dramatis  sic personas heart is laid open by subtle indirect absolutely sure and tender poetry 120 as a result of his new york performance his name and picture were carried in all the major eastern papers and he quickly became well known throughout the united states sales of the boss girl increased resulting in the fifth and largest printing and riley finally began to achieve the widespread fame he sought 60clemens disliked being upstaged by riley and thereafter attempted to avoid any future joint performances with him according to one review clemens shriveled up into a bitter patch of melancholy in the fierce light of mr rileys humour 121after returning home from his tour in early 1888 riley finished compiling his third book titled oldfashioned roses arranged to appeal to british readers it included only a few of his dialect poems and consisted mostly of sonnets the book reprinted many poems riley had already published but included some new ones he wrote specifically for the book including the days gone by the little white hearse and the serenade the book was rileys favorite because it included his finest works and was published by the prestigious longmans green publishers in a high quality binding and print 122 123in late 1888 he finished work on a fourth book pipes o pan at zekesbury which was released to great acclaim in the united states based on a fictional town in indiana riley presented many stories and poems about its citizens and way of life it received mixed reviews among literary critics who wrote of it that rileys stories were not of the same quality as his poetry the book was very popular with the public and went through numerous reprints 124 125riley was quickly becoming wealthy from his books and touring earning nearly 20000 in 1888 he no longer needed his job at the journal and he left the job near the end of that year the newspaper had served to earn him fame and had published hundreds of his articles stories and poems 126national fame  editpolitics  editjames whitcomb riley issue of 1940an advertisement for riley and nyes show in march 1888 riley traveled to washington d c where he had dinner at the white house with other members of the international copyright league and president of the united states grover cleveland riley made a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections cleveland was enamored by rileys performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics 127 in the 1888 presidential election campaign rileys acquaintance benjamin harrison was nominated as the republican candidate although riley had shunned politics for most of his life he gave harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fundraising events and vote stumping the election was exceptionally partisan in indiana and riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful he vowed never to become involved with politics again 128upon harrisons election he suggested riley be named the national poet laureate but congress failed to act on the request riley was still honored by harrison and visited him at the white house on several occasions to perform at civic events 129pay problems and scandal  editriley and nye made arrangements with james pond to make two national tours during 1888 and 1889 130 the tours were popular and generally sold out with hundreds having to be turned away the shows were usually fortyfive minutes to an hour long and featured riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from nye the shows were informal and the two men adjusted their performances based on their audiences reactions riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility 129 131 many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows at a new york city show in march 1888 augustin daly was so enthralled by the show he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading broadway theatre actors 132despite riley serving as the acts main draw he was not permitted to become an equal partner in the venture nye and pond both received a percentage of the net profit while riley was paid a flat rate for each performance 133 in addition because of rileys past agreements with the redpath lyceum bureau he was required to pay half of his fee to his agent amos walker this caused the other men to profit more than riley from his own work 124to remedy this situation riley hired his brotherinlaw henry eitel an indianapolis banker to manage his finances and act on his behalf to try and extricate him from his contract despite discussions and assurances from pond that he would work to address the problem eitel had no success pond ultimately made the situation worse by booking months of solid performances not allowing riley and nye a day of rest these events affected riley physically and emotionally he became despondent and began his worst period of alcoholism during november 1889 the tour was forced to cancel several shows after riley became severely inebriated at a stop in madison wisconsin 134 135walker began monitoring riley and denying him access to liquor but riley found ways to evade walker at a stop at the masonic temple theatre in louisville kentucky in january 1890 riley paid the hotels bartender to sneak whiskey to his room 136 he became too drunk to perform and was unable to travel to the next stop nye terminated the partnership and tour in response the reason for the breakup could not be kept secret and hotel staff reported to the louisville courierjournal that they saw riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel 137 the story made national news and riley feared his career was ruined 138he secretly left louisville at night and returned to indianapolis by train eitel defended riley to the press in an effort to gain sympathy for riley explaining the abusive financial arrangements his partners had made riley however refused to speak to reporters and hid himself for weeks 139 much to rileys surprise the news reports made him more popular than ever 140 many people thought the stories were exaggerated and rileys carefully cultivated image made it difficult for the public to believe he was an alcoholic riley had stopped sending poetry to newspapers and magazines in the aftermath but they soon began corresponding with him requesting that he resume writing this encouraged riley and he made another attempt to give up liquor as he returned to his public career 141the negative press did not end however as nye and pond threatened to sue riley for causing their tour to end prematurely they claimed to have lost 20000 walker threatened a separate suit demanding 1000 riley hired indianapolis lawyer william p fishback to represent him and the men settled out of court 142 the full details of the settlement were never disclosed but whatever the case riley finally extricated himself from his old contracts and became a free agent the exorbitant amount riley was being sued for only reinforced public opinion that riley had been mistreated by his partners and helped him maintain his image nye and riley remained good friends and riley later wrote that pond and walker were the source of the problems 143rileys poetry had become popular in britain in large part due to his book oldfashioned roses in may 1891 he traveled to england to make a tour and what he considered a literary pilgrimage he landed in liverpool and traveled first to dumfries scotland the home and burial place of robert burns riley had long been compared to burns by critics because they both used dialect in their poetry and drew inspiration from their rural homes 144 145 he then traveled to edinburgh york and london reciting poetry for

possess the ability 149by 1890 riley had authored almost all of his famous poems the few poems he wrote during the 1890s were generally less well received by the public 147 as a solution riley and his publishers began reusing poetry from other books and printing some of his earliest works when neighborly poems was published in 1891 a critic working for the chicago tribune pointed out the use of rileys earliest works commenting that riley was using his popularity to push his crude earlier works onto the public only to make money 150 151 rileys newest poems published in the 1894 book armazindy received very negative reviews that referred to poems like the little dogwoggy and jargonjingle as drivel and to riley as a worn out genius 150 most of his growing number of critics suggested that he ignored the quality of the poems for the sake of making money 150last tours  editalthough riley was wealthy from his books he was able to triple his annual income by touring he found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892 he hired william c glass to assist henry eitel in managing his affairs while eitel handled the finances glass worked to organize his lecture tours 152 glass worked closely with rileys publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation he was careful not to book busy schedules riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short lasting only three months 153during his 1893 tour riley lectured mostly in the western united states and in his 1894 tour in the east his performances were major events and generally sold out within days of their announcements in 1894 he allowed author douglass sherley to

last tour making stops in most of the major cities in the united states 155 advertised as his final performances there was incredible demand for tickets and riley performed before his largest audiences during the tour he and sherley continued a show very similar to those that he and nye had done riley often lamented the lack of change in the program but found when he tried to introduce new material or left out any of his most popular poems the crowds would demand encores until he agreed to recite their favorites 156childrens poet  editriley holds his pet dog while posing for a photo

festival board has a queen contest the 2010–2011 queen was corinne butler the pageant has been going on many years in honor of the hoosier poet 193according to historian elizabeth van allen riley was instrumental in helping form a midwestern cultural identity the midwestern united states had no significant literary community before the 1880s 194 the works of the western association of writers most notably those of riley and wallace helped create the midwests cultural identity and create a rival literary community to the established eastern literari for this reason and the publicity rileys work created he was commonly known as the hoosier poet 195 196critical reception and style  editriley was among the most popular writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century known for his uncomplicated sentimental and humorous writing 197 often writing his verses in dialect his poetry caused readers to recall a nostalgic and simpler time in earlier american history this gave his poetry a unique appeal during a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization in the united states riley was a prolific writer who achieved mass appeal partly due to his canny sense of marketing and publicity 197 he published more than fifty books mostly of poetry and humorous short stories and sold millions of copies 197riley is often remembered for his most famous poems including the raggedy man and little orphant annie many of his poems used events and people from his childhood as an inspiration for subject matter 197 his poems often contained morals and warnings for children containing messages telling children to care for the less fortunate of society david galens and van allen both see these messages as rileys subtle response to the turbulent economic times of the gilded age and the growing progressive movement 198 riley believed that urbanization robbed children of their innocence and sincerity and in his poems he attempted to introduce and idolize characters who had not lost those qualities 199 his childrens poems are exuberant performative and often display rileys penchant for using humorous characterization repetition and dialect to make his poetry accessible to a wideranging audience 197 200although hinted at indirectly in some poems riley wrote very little on serious subject matter and actually mocked attempts at serious poetry only a few of his sentimental poems concerned serious subjects little mandys christmastree the absence of little wesley and the happy little cripple were about poverty the death of a child and disabilities like his childrens poems they too contained morals suggesting society should pity the downtrodden and be charitable 197 200riley wrote gentle and romantic poems that were not in dialect they generally consisted of sonnets and were strongly influenced by the works of john greenleaf whittier henry wadsworth longfellow and alfred lord tennyson his standard english poetry was never as popular as his hoosier dialect poems 197 still less popular were the poems riley authored in his later years most were to commemorate important events of american history and to eulogize the dead 197rileys contemporaries acclaimed him americas bestloved poet 197 200 in 1920 henry beers lauded the works of riley as natural and unaffected with none of the discontent and deep thought of cultured song 197 samuel clemens william dean howells and hamlin garland each praised rileys work and the idealism he expressed in his poetry only a few critics of the period found fault with rileys works ambrose bierce criticized riley for his frequent use of dialect bierce accused riley of using dialect to cover up the faulty construction of his poems 197 edgar lee masters found rileys work to be superficial claiming it lacked irony and that he had only a narrow emotional range 197 by the 1930s popular critical opinion towards rileys works began to shift in favor of the negative reviews in 1951 james t farrell said rileys works were cliched galens wrote that modern critics consider riley to be a minor poet whose work—provincial sentimental and superficial though it may have been—nevertheless struck a chord with a mass audience in a time of enormous cultural change 197 thomas c johnson wrote that what most interests modern critics was rileys ability to market his work saying he had a unique understanding of how to commodify his own image and the nostalgic dreams of an anxious nation 197among the earliest widespread criticisms of riley were opinions that his dialect writing did not actually represent the true dialect of central indiana in 1970 peter revell wrote that rileys dialect was more similar to the poor speech of a child rather than the dialect of his region revell made extensive comparison to historical texts and rileys dialect usage philip greasley wrote that while some critics have dismissed him as subliterary insincere and an artificial entertainer his defenders reply that an author so popular with millions of people in different walks of life must contribute something of value and that his faults if any can be ignored 200see also  editindiana portal poetry portal childrens literature portal
