tipping wedding vendors everything you need to know now morethough you may think youve accounted for every imaginable wedding expense there is one fee that might elude you the tip tipping vendors from photographers and florists to caterers and djs is expected and it will serve as a thankyou for a job well done but figuring out whom to tip how much to tip and when to offer it can be tricky here we provide an expert guide on how to tip your wedding vendors while some vendors include gratuities in their fees many will leave the amount up to you—and the level of service they provide can influence what you give them vendor tipping can add up quickly costing you a few thousand dollars gratuities for caterers alone can be 200 to 600 or more for example depending on the number of guests your catering costs and where you live most tips should be handed out the day of the wedding so its wise to assign the job to a friend or family member a followup thankyou note is often a valued tip in itself as your word can be a recommendation for the vendor officiants while it isnt necessary to tip priests ministers rabbis or other religious officiants many of them in fact wont accept cash tips if you want to thank them for their services consider making a donation to their organization or house of worship a typical amount is 75 to 100 separate from any fee you may be charged for the officiants time if you belong to a church your own minister or priest may perform the wedding at no charge in this case you could make a donation to the church and as an extra thankyou consider sending something personal such as a gift certificate to a nice restaurant if your wedding is performed by a civil employee such as a judge clerk or other nonreligious official then forgo a gratuity such officiants are paid a flat rate and are usually not permitted to accept tips or donations—local law may actually prohibit it a thoughtful card however is always appreciated catering staff waiters bartenders chefs etc many caterers include a gratuity in their contract to be divided up among the workers but be sure to ask if the gratuity isnt included plan on tipping all staff members including the catering or banquet manager waiters bartenders chefs and other essential workers who help serve guests most catering staff members receive a decent hourly wage so you neednt go overboard on their tips you can calculate the tip as a percentage of the cost of your total catering bill figure on paying about 15 to 20 percent of the amount for the banquet manager to share with the kitchen and serving staff another way to compute the gratuity is to offer a flat amount for each worker which is often a more economical method especially if your catering company is expensive youll want to give roughly 100 to 200 for the catering or banquet manager 50 each for chefs and bakers and 20 to 30 each for waiters and kitchen staff divided into separate envelopes tips can be paid in advance to the director of the catering company or you can hand them to the banquet manager toward the end of the evening musicians and djs tipping customs vary depending on whether you hire an independent band or dj or book through an agency for independent bands that book their own gigs tipping is not customary no matter what your dj or band is charging the money is going right into their pockets so dont feel like you have to give extra unless of course they really went above and beyond says kelly scriven owner of the brides maid a wedding consulting business in whitman massachusetts valerie romanoff owner of new york citybased starlight orchestras adds were always pleasantly surprised when clients tip us and recognize the entertainment value of what we provide but its not expected if you employ your band or dj through an entertainment agency the company will usually either include a gratuity in the contract or suggest that you give each band member or dj a little extra in cash if your contract includes a service charge dont assume that it is the gratuity the service charge often goes right back to the company says scriven musicians should be tipped about 20 to 25 apiece djs get at least 25 many bands offer a vocalist for the ceremony at an additional cost tip him or her the same amount as you would one of the other musicians hand out the tips in cash at the end of the night stylists and makeup artists even though its a particularly special day you can still tip stylists and makeup artists as you would for a regular appointment—15 to 20 percent for each assistant who helps with secondary tasks such as shampooing plan on giving a gratuity of 3 to 5 you can hand out tips in envelopes directly to stylists or leave them at the salons front desk if youre short on cash its fine to tip by check or include it on a charge if a stylist comes to your home or the wedding site tip as you would at a salon but in general makeup artists and hair stylists who own their own businesses are not tipped photographers videographers florists and wedding coordinators for people who own their own businesses as many of these vendors do tipping isnt necessary theyve already negotiated their fees and expect only that amount of money says jeremy faryar of lifestories film a new york city videography company that specializes in weddings for photographers videographers and florists who do not own their own businesses tip 30 to 50 wedding coordinators should be given about 50 to 100 if you feel that the service you received from one of these vendors was extraordinary say if the videographer stayed and took footage of an afterwedding party even though it wasnt in his contract an additional 10 percent tip would be a nice gesture says ruth l kern an etiquette consultant in barrington illinois or you might send a thankyou gift such as flowers or a print from your photographer showing the vendor in action at your wedding site staff wherever you have your wedding there will likely be many behindthescenes workers such as coat checkers powderroom attendants or parking valets make sure you do not overlook these people—while you may not have much contact with them throughout the celebration they help keep guests happy sometime before the wedding ask the site manager to instruct workers not to accept any tips from guests instead plan on tipping them yourself at the end of the evening pay coat checkers a total of 1 to 2 per guest which they can share powderroom attendants should receive 50 cents to 1 per guest to be divided among them set aside 1 to 150 per car to give to the parking manager who can then divide up the cash among the valets seamstresses delivery people and drivers though they wont actually be at the wedding these workers preparatory roles are just as important so be sure to thank them in some way the people delivering the flowers and cake should receive at least 5 each at the time they make their deliveries a gratuity for your limousine driver may already be included in your bill but if its not consider giving a tip of 15 to 20 percent of the cost pay it in cash when the driver picks you up for seamstresses a cash tip is not expected but sending a small gift such as a photo of you in your dress is a wonderful way to show your gratitude comments 20add a commentjamiegopaintgm nov 12 2015those of us like myself a live event painter are
