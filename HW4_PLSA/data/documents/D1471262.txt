from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search laryngeal paralysis in animals is a condition in which the nerves and muscles that control the movements of one or both arytenoid cartilages of the larynx cease to function and instead of opening during inspiration and closing during swallowing the arytenoids remain stationary in a somewhat neutral position specifically the muscle that causes abduction of the arytenoid cartilage the cricoarytenoideus dorsalis muscle ceases to function this leads to inadequate ventilation during exercise and during thermoregulatory panting as well as incomplete protection of the airway during swallowing one of the commonest forms of laryngeal paralysis develops in geriatric medium to large breed dogs in particular the labrador retriever but also some other breeds this had been traditionally known as idiopathic largyngeal paralysis ilp idiopathic means of unknown cause and was believed to be a result of a condition affecting the nerves of the larynx bilateral mononeuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerves however investigations into ilp by two groups in michigan and tennessee between 2005  2013 showed that the condition was not limited to or specifically a result of dysfunction of the laryngeal nerves instead it was the most visible symptom of a slowly progressing polyneuropathy of old age which also affected other nerves in the body this finding now generally believed correct following further research has led to the proposed renaming of this type of laryngeal paralysis from idiopathic laryngeal paralysis ilp to  geriatric onset laryngeal paralysis polyneuropathy  golpp animals affected by laryngeal paralysis have reduced tolerance for exercise and heat and an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia the condition is not generally regarded as causing pain other than physical distress and anxiety caused by any difficulty in breathing or emotional distress from any difficulty with physical movement where laryngeal paralysis is related to a general progressive polyneuropathy as in golpp the nervous system will gradually degenerate causing increasing difficulty in management of the limbs especially rear limbs swallowing and breathing and eventually in most cases euthanasia laryngeal paralysis is fairly common in large breed and geriatric dogs particularly in the labrador retriever is rarely found in cats and can also occur in horses where it is referred to as roaring roarers syndrome or medically as laryngeal hemiplegia or recurrent laryngeal neuropathy rln 1 laryngeal paralysis can be unilateral or bilateral depending upon dysfunction of one or both arytenoid cartilages contents  hide 1 causes2 signs3 diagnosis4 treatment5 complications of surgical treatment6 references7 external links causes  editin most cases the cause of laryngeal paralysis is unknown or idiopathic however the disorder may arise secondary to general neuropathies generalized neuromuscular diseases muscular diseases neoplasia either in the cervical neck region or the cranial mediastinum or trauma this acquired form occurs predominantly in middleaged to old large breed or giant breed dogs such as the labrador retriever golden retriever siberian husky newfoundland and st bernard usually these dogs are born with a normal larynx but over time the nerves and muscles that control the laryngeal cartilages lose function 2laryngeal paralysis may also be congenital in some breeds eg bouvier des flandres dalmatians siberian huskies and bulldogs  appearing in dogs between two and six months of age affected puppies may have difficulty swallowing and breathing they may gag frequently and their bark often sounds abnormal in dalmatians it is part of another condition called laryngeal paralysispolyneuropathy complex affected puppies should not be used for breeding 2choke collars are not thought to be a significant risk factor for this disorder however after lp is diagnosed it is usually recommended to stop using a collar or anything else around the dogs neck and to switch to a harness instead signs  editsigns of laryngeal paralysis include voice change the dogs bark becomes hoarsesounding gagging or coughing often during or after eating or drinking exercise intolerance inspiratory stridor noisy breathing on inspiration difficulty breathing and in severe cases cyanosis or syncope fainting secondary problems may also occur including aspiration or edema in the lungs though often the problem remains an upper respiratory problem affected dogs are vulnerable to heat stroke and heat exhaustion due to their limited ability to cool themselves down by panting but the disorder itself can be mistaken for heat stroke signs may occur at any time but initially owners may only notice that their dogs bark sounds different that their dog cant run as much as before or that the dog has trouble in hot weather in unilateral cases because the unaffected side can compensate for the paralysed side however most unilateral cases will eventually progress to include both sides of the larynx a more serious problem with symptoms appearing more often signs are usually worse in hot and humid weather during exercise during times of stress or excitement and in obese pets acute or latestage symptoms are usually unmistakable and require immediate emergency treatment diagnosis  editthis condition is usually diagnosed by direct examination of the larynx under light sedation which also allows checking for benign or malignant tumors tests such as thoracic radiographs ctscans or echocardiography are sometimes needed to rule out heart lung or mediastinal diseases or other possible causes of the symptoms often seen with lp some vets may also recommend running a thyroid profile since lp can be a symptom or complication of hypothyroidism treatment  editmild cases are managed by limiting activity keeping a healthy body weight and avoiding exposure to high ambient temperatures mild sedatives can be used to decrease anxiety and panting and therefore improve respiration corticosteroids may also be administered in acute cases to decrease inflammation and edema of the larynx severe acute symptoms such as difficulty breathing hyperthermia or aspiration pneumonia must be stabilized with sedatives and oxygen therapy and may require steroid or antibiotic medications sometimes a tracheotomy is required to allow delivery of oxygen once the patient is stabilized surgical treatment may be beneficial especially when paralysis occurs in both aretynoid cartilages bilateral paralysis the surgery aretynoid lateralization or a laryngeal tieback consists of suturing one of the aretynoid cartilages in a maximally abducted open position this reduces the signs associated with inadequate ventilation such as exercise intolerance or overheating but may exacerbate the risk of aspiration and consequent pneumonia tying back only one of the aretynoid cartilages instead of both helps reduce the risk of aspiration afterwards the dog will still sound hoarse and will need to be managed in the same way as those with mild cases of lp recent studies have found that many dogs with laryngeal paralysis have decreased motility of their esophagus animals with a history of regurgitation or vomiting should be fully evaluated for esophageal or other gastrointestinal disorders dogs with megaesophagus or other conditions causing frequent vomiting or regurgitation are at high risk for aspiration pneumonia after laryngeal tieback permanent tracheostomy is an alternative surgical option for these dogs to palliate their clinical signs complications of surgical treatment  editbesides complications of surgery and anesthesia in general there may be drainage swelling or redness of the incision gagging or coughing during eating or drinking or pneumonia due to aspiration of food or liquids undesirable complications are estimated to occur in 1030 of cases if medical therapy is unsuccessful and surgery cannot be performed due to concurrent disease such as heart or lung problems or cost euthanasia may be necessary if the animals quality of life is considered unacceptable due
