dividing a 4digit by 2digit numbers how to divide a four digit number by a two digit number eg 4138 รท 17 place the divisor before the division bracket and place the dividend 4138 under it174138examine the first digit of the dividend 4 it is smaller than 17 so cant be divided by 17 to produce a whole number next take the first two digits of the dividend 41 and determine how many 17s it contains in this case 41 holds two seventeens 21734 but not three 31751 place the 2 above the division bracket2 174138multiply the 2 by 17 and place the result 34 below the 41 of the dividend2 174138 34draw a line under the 34 and subtract it from 41 41347 bring down the 3 from the 4138 and place it to the right of the 72 174138 34 73divide 73 by 17 and place that answer above the division bracket and to the right of the two24 174138 34 73multiply the 4 of the quotient by the divisor 17 to get 68 and place this below the 73 under the dividend subtract 68 from 73 to give an answer of 5 bring down the 8 from the dividend 4138 and place it next to the 524 174138 34 73 68 58divide 58 by 17 and place that answer 3 above the division bracket and to the right of the four243 174138 34 73 68 58multiply the 3 of the quotient by the divisor 17 to get 51 and place this below the 58 under the dividend subtract 51 from 58 to give an answer of 7243 174138 34 73 68 58 51 7there are no more digits in the dividend to bring down so the 7 is a remainder the final answer could be written in several ways 243 remainder 7 or sometimes 243r7 or as a mixed number 243 717return to top
