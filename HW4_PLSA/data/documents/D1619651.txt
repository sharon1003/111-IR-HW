11jan breaking down bow string materialsby brad patsy every day we get asked several times about bow string material and what is best or what should be used on a certain makemodel of bow it seems that there is an abundance of false information from ‘string gurus’ on various internet forums so we’ve decided to write a little article based on our firsthand knowledge we’ve gathered from years of building bow strings with all the bow string materials out there it can be mind boggling trying to decide what material you want your new bow string and cable set made from each bow string material is composed of various raw materials that give each one its own properties i’m no scientist and could really care less about blendednon blended or what grade dyneema vectran gore and so on that goes into each material i will be referring to some of this info for comparison later on though i will start off with custom compound bow string materials this seems to be one of the most debated topics there are a handful of bow string materials on the market today that work very well when it comes to producing a custom bow string that will be durable and stable while providing good arrow speed these materials would include d97 8125g trophy 8190 452x and x bcy 452x has been around forever it has proven itself time and time again 452x is the material that all others are compared to it is extremely stable and gives good arrow speed it is available in solid and speckled colors which is very nice for giving virtually unlimited color options for your custom bow string the one drawback to 452x is that it is prone to fuzzing this was addressed when bcy introduced the trophy material trophy is basically 452x with an added gore fiber to improve durability while the added gore fiber definitely improved the durability we did not care for the material we found it to be inconsistent from color to color and batch to batch we also experienced a loss in stability when we switched from 452x to trophy i still don’t understand how adding a single fiber can hurt stability but that was our experience for that reason we quit using trophy after a short time and went back to 452x bcy 8125 g is another material that has been around for quite a while originally 8125 the new 8125g has the added gore fiber for better durability this is the fastest bow string material we’ve tested due to its makeup it is more prone to stretch in the heat while some string builders have had success with this material we do not use it for this reason 8125g is a great material for modern recurve bow strings both traditional and olympic bcy d97 is a good allaround bow string material that is generally used as an ‘economy’ material in today’s industry due to its cheaper price d97 was once a major step up from fast flight bows string but has since been replaced by several other better materials while no longer a top choice for a compound bow string d97 is still very popular with crossbows and recurve bow strings it’s ‘sponginess’ helps to absorb the shock on these bows without damaging their limbs8190 has been around a few years now comparing it to 452x it has improved durability and better speed i do feel that 452x has the edge in stability though i don’t want to give the misconception the 8190 will be stretching all over the place but we have had reports of some minor retiming issues needing to be done while we prefer x over 8190 for compounds we have found 8190 to be a top shelf bow string material for crossbows and recurves bcy x is the newest bcy bow string material in a nutshell it’s the best parts of 452x and 8190 wrapped into one material the gore fiber has been removed from 8190 and replaced with vectran from 452x vectran is fiber that gives 452x its stability we have found the x material to give the best combination of speed stability and durability all in one material for this reason the bcy x is our bow string material of choice other bow string materials include 652 fast flight and b55 dacron these are both still widely used on older compound bows crossbows and traditional bows dacron string works well on older tear drop style compound bows and crossbows it is also the best bow string material to be used on wooden traditional bows with nonreinforced limb tips fast flight is mainly used on traditional bows with reinforced limb tips and older compound bows i hope this little article has helped to answer some of the questions about bowstring materials if anyone has any bowstring related questions or topics that you would like to discuss or even have us write about feel free to contact us through our website at www60xcustom stringscom share
