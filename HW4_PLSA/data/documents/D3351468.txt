out the music himself for presentation to the margrave rather than leaving it to a copyist while he took the opportunity to revise the music most likely it was not freshly composed he appears to have selected the six pieces from concertos he had composed over a number of years while kapellmeister at köthen and possibly extending back to his employment at weimar 1708–17 3bachs dedication to the margrave was dated 24 march 1721 translated from the original french the first sentence of bachs dedication reads as i had the good fortune a few years ago to be heard by your royal highness at your highnesss commands and as i noticed then that your highness took some pleasure in the little talents which heaven has given me for music and as in taking leave of your royal highness your highness deigned to honour me with the command to send your highness some pieces of my composition i have in accordance with your highnesss most gracious orders taken the liberty of rendering my most humble duty to your royal highness with the present concertos which i have adapted to several instruments begging your highness most humbly not to judge their imperfection with the rigor of that discriminating and sensitive taste which everyone knows him to have for musical works but rather to take into benign consideration the profound respect and the most humble obedience which i thus attempt to show him 4 5bachs reference to his scoring the concertos for several instruments  concerts avec plusieurs instruments is an understatement bach used the widest spectrum of orchestral instruments … in daring combinations as christoph wolff has commented 6 every one of the six concertos set a precedent in scoring and every one was to remain without parallel heinrich besseler has noted that the overall forces required leaving aside the first concerto which was rewritten for a special occasion tallies exactly with the 17 players bach had at his disposal in köthen 7content

duration about 22 minutes this concerto is the only one in the collection with four movements the concerto also exists in an alternative version sinfonia bwv 1046a which appears to have been composed during bachs years at weimar the sinfonia which lacks the third movement entirely and the polacca from the final movement appears to have been intended as the opening of the cantata was mir behagt ist nur die muntre jagd bwv 208 this implies a date of composition possibly as early as the 1713 premiere of the cantata although it could have been used for a subsequent revival 8the first movement can also be found as the sinfonia of a later cantata falsche welt dir trau ich nicht bwv 52 but in a version without the piccolo violin that is closer to sinfonia bwv 1046a the third movement was used as the opening chorus of the cantata vereinigte zwietracht der wechselnden saiten bwv 207 where the horns are replaced by trumpets no 2 in f major bwv 1047  editbrandenburg concerto no 2 in f major i

allegro assai concertino clarino natural trumpet in f recorder or replaced by flute  oboe violin ripieno two violins viola violone and basso continuo including harpsichordduration about 13 minutes the trumpet part is still considered one of the most difficult in the entire repertoire and was originally written for a clarino specialist almost certainly the court trumpeter in köthen johann ludwig schreiber 9 after clarino skills were lost in the eighteenth century and before the rise of the historically informed performance movement of the late twentieth century the part was usually played on the valved trumpet the clarino does not play in the second movement as is common practice in baroque era concerti this is due to its construction which allows it to play only in major keys because concerti often move to a minor key in the second movement concerti that include the instrument in their first movement and are from the period before the valved trumpet was commonly used usually exclude the trumpet from the second movement the first movement of this concerto was chosen as the first musical piece to be played on the voyager golden record a phonograph record containing a broad sample of earths common sounds languages and music sent into outer space with the two voyager probes the first movement served as a theme for great performances in the early to mid 80s while the third movement served as the theme for william f buckley jr s firing line no 3 in g major bwv 1048  editbrandenburg concerto no 3 – 1 allegro performed by the advent chamber orchestra a simple example of

moderatoadagio in e minor allegro instrumentation three violins three violas three cellos and basso continuo including harpsichordduration about 10 minutes the second movement consists of a single measure with the two chords that make up a  phrygian half cadence  10 and—although there is no direct evidence to support it—it was likely that these chords are meant to surround or follow a cadenza improvised by a harpsichord or violin player modern performance approaches range from simply playing the cadence with minimal ornamentation treating it as a sort of musical semicolon to inserting movements from other works to cadenzas varying in length from under a minute to over two minutes wendy carlos s three electronic performances from switchedon bach switchedon brandenburgs and switchedon bach 2000 have second movements that are completely different from each other occasionally the third movement from bachs sonata for violin and continuo in g bwv 1021 marked largo is substituted for the second movement as it contains an identical phrygian cadence as the closing chords the largo from the sonata for violin and obbligato harpsichord in g major bwv 1019 has also been used the outer movements use the ritornello form found in many instrumental and vocal works of the time the first movement can also be found in reworked form as the sinfonia of the cantata ich liebe

viola è violone in ripieno violoncello è continuo 1allegro andante in e minor presto concertino violin and two recorders described in the original score as fiauti decho ripieno two violins viola cello violone and basso continuo duration about 16 minutes the violin part in this concerto is extremely virtuosic in the first and third movements in the second movement the violin provides a bass when the concertino group plays unaccompanied it has been debated what instrument bach had in mind for the fiauti decho parts nowadays these are usually played on alto recorders 11 although traverse flutes are sometimes used instead it is also theorized bachs original intent may have been the flageolet in some performances such as those conducted by nikolaus harnoncourt the two recorders are positioned offstage thus giving an echo effect bach adapted the 4th brandenburg concerto as a harpsichord concerto bwv 1057 no 5 in d major bwv 1050  editbrandenburg concerto no 5 – 1 allegro performed by the

une violino principale une violino è una viola in ripieno violoncello violone è cembalo concertato 1allegro affettuoso in b minor allegro concertino harpsichord violin flute ripieno violin viola cello violone harpsichordduration about 23 minutes the harpsichord is both a concertino and a ripieno instrument in the concertino passages the part is obbligato in the ripieno passages it has a figured bass part and plays continuo this concerto makes use of a popular chamber music ensemble of the time flute violin and harpsichord which bach used on its own for the middle movement it is believed that it was written in 1719 to show off a new harpsichord by michael mietke which bach had brought back from berlin for the köthen court it is also thought that bach wrote it for a competition at dresden with the french composer and organist louis marchand in the central movement bach uses one of marchands themes marchand fled before the competition could take place apparently scared off in the face of bachs great reputation for virtuosity and improvisation the concerto is well suited throughout to showing off the qualities of a fine harpsichord and the virtuosity of its player but especially in the lengthy solo cadenza to the first movement it seems almost certain that bach considered a great organ and harpsichord virtuoso was the harpsichord soloist at the premiere scholars have seen in this work the origins of the solo keyboard concerto as it is the first example of a concerto with a solo keyboard part 12 13an earlier version bwv 1050a exists and has many small differences from its later cousin but no major difference in structure or instrumentation it is dated ca 1720–21 no 6 in b ♭ major bwv 1051  editbrandenburg concerto no 6 – 1 allegro performed by the advent chamber

performed at allegro or allegro moderatoadagio ma non tanto in e ♭ major ends in an imperfect cadence of g minorallegro instrumentation two viole da braccio two viole da gamba cello violone and harpsichord duration about 16 minutes the absence of violins is unusual viola da braccio means the normal viola and is used here to distinguish it from the viola da gamba when the work was written in 1721 the viola da gamba was already an oldfashioned instrument the strong supposition that one viola da gamba part was taken by his employer prince leopold also points to a likely reason for the concertos composition—leopold wished to join his kapellmeister playing music other theories speculate that since the viola da braccio was typically played by a lower socioeconomic class servants for example the work sought to upend the musical status quo by giving an important role to a lesser instrument this is supported by the knowledge that bach wished to end his tenure under prince leopold by upsetting the balance of the musical roles he would be released from his servitude as kapellmeister and allowed to seek employment elsewhere 14the two violas start the first movement with a vigorous subject in close canon and as the movement progresses the other instruments are gradually drawn into the seemingly uninterrupted steady flow of melodic invention which shows the composers mastery of polyphony the two violas da gamba are silent in the second movement leaving the texture of a trio sonata for two violas and continuo although the cello has a decorated version of the continuo bass line in the last movement the spirit of the gigue underlies everything as it did in the finale of the fifth concerto reception  editbecause king frederick william i of prussia was not a significant patron of the arts christian ludwig seems to have lacked the musicians in his berlin ensemble to perform the concertos the full score was left unused in the margraves library until his death in 1734 when it was sold for 24 groschen as of 2014 about us24 of silver the autograph manuscript of the concertos was only rediscovered in the archives of brandenburg by siegfried wilhelm dehn in 1849 the concertos were first published in the following year 15the manuscript was nearly lost in world war ii when being transported for safekeeping to prussia by train in the care of a librarian the train came under aerial bombardment and the librarian escaped the train to the nearby forest with the scores hidden under his coat 16in the modern era these works have been performed by orchestras with the string parts each played by a number of players under the batons of for example karl richter and herbert von karajan they have also been performed as chamber music with one instrument per part
