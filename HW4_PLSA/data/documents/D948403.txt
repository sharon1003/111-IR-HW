long see ya next time production  editafter a long career producing comedy shorts producer hal roach was looking to expand into longform films and found a property in the jovial ghosts a semirisqué 1926 novel by thorne smith roach immediately wanted cary grant to play george kerby but he had difficulty getting the actor to agree to play the part since grant was concerned about the supernatural aspects of the story assurance from roach that the screwball aspects of the story would be played up – plus a fee of 50000 – were sufficient to convince grant to do the film 4for grants opposite number roach was interested in jean harlow and as topper w c fields but harlow was too ill and fields turned down the offer when roach reached out to constance bennett she was impressed enough with the property that she agreed to be paid less than her usual 40000 fee 4topper was shot at hal roach studios in culver city 5 and location shooting took place at the entrance to the bullocks department store on wilshire boulevard – as the entrance to the seabreeze hotel 1 – and at a location on san rafael avenue in pasadena california 5the automobile used by george and marion kerby before they become ghosts and later by cosmo topper – whose own car is a 1936 lincoln model k – is a custommade vehicle with a resemblance to cord and duesenberg automobiles of the 1930s production models of a cord were too small to use so the custom body was built on the chassis of a 1936 buick roadmaster by bohman  schwartz and the external exhaust pipes characteristic of a supercharged cord are nonfunctional the buick roadmaster of the time used an eightinline straight eight engine whereas the cord used a v8 engine so external exhaust pipes on both sides of the hood as per the cord arrangement would have meant that at least one side of the car and probably both used dummy external pipes the buick trunk had special compartments for camera equipment afterwards the car was purchased by the gilmore oil co who used it for many years for promotional purposes in 1954 the vehicle was updated utilizing a chrysler imperial chassis and drive train 6 7reception  edittopper was a boxoffice hit and gave a boost to the careers of all the lead actors in particular cary grant who moved from this film into a series of classic screwball comedies such as the awful truth 1937 bringing up baby 1938 and holiday 1938 8 constance bennett – who had previously been known as more of a clotheshorse than an actress – received very good notices and roach reunited her with director mc leod and screenwriters jevne and moran – as well as billie burke and alan mowbray – for 1938s merrily we live 8awards and honors  edittopper was nominated for academy awards for best actor in a supporting
