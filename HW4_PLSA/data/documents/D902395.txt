recent study investigated the effects of dietary mediumchain triglycerides on liver fat accumulation in growing rats with protein malnutrition weaning rats were fed either a lowprotein diet or control protein diet either in combination with or without mediumchain triglycerides after four weeks liver fat increased in the lowprotein groups compared with the control groups however the liver fat content in the lowprotein group fed mediumchain triglycerides was significantly decreased compared with that in the other lowprotein group according to the studythese results suggest that ingestion of a lowprotein diet caused fatty liver in growing rats however when rats were fed the lowprotein diet with mediumchain triglycerides hepatic triglyceride deposition was attenuated and m rna levels encoding cpt1a and cpt2 were preserved at the levels of rats fed control protein dietsdr mercolas comments over twothirds of american adults are now overweight or obese and onethird of adults along with 17 percent of children and teens are obese in fact in 2010 data from the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc showed that no state had a prevalence of obesity less than 20 percent and 36 states had an obesity prevalence of 25 percent or more clearly overweight and obesity are at epidemic proportions and this trend is putting both adults and children at risk of serious chronic disease ranging from high blood pressure and heart disease to diabetes and cancer as for whats causing so many americans to gain excess weight its a complex situation why are so many americans overweight and obese theres the fact that the u s government heavily subsidizes the very foods that contribute to weight gain ie corn theres the problem with environmental chemicals like phthalates which can interfere with the hormonal mechanisms that control your weight theres the abundance of stress that many people live with on a daily basis which leads to emotional eating as well as chronic elevations of the hormone cortisol that in turn leads to weight gain around your midsection but theres also another issue that cannot be ignored misinformation many americans are seriously confused about what a truly healthful food is and this is partly the result of clever and deceptive marketing that makes junk foods and synthetic substances like artificial sweeteners appear healthy further fats in general are still considered the dietary villains by many people a consumer reports survey found that 51 percent said they are limiting their consumption of fat in belief that this is a healthy choice changes are this lumps all fats into one evil category when in reality the only types of fats you should really be limiting are manmade varieties like transfats and rancid refined polyunsaturated fats in vegetable oils eating healthy fat doesnt make you fat its encouraging to see mainstream media outlets like yahoo busting the prevalent myth that fat must be avoided if you want to lose weight in fact research suggests that eating healthy fats is actually conducive to weight loss when you eat fats as part of your meal they actually slow down your food absorption so that you can go longer without feeling hungry the fatty acid conjugated linoleic acid cla found in grassfed beef and fullfat dairy products from grassfed cows butter milk cheese etc  is also associated with reduced body fat and weight for instance a study in the american journal of clinical nutrition found that people who ate 32 grams of cla a day had a drop in fat mass of about 02 pounds a week thats about one pound a month compared to those given a placebo research also shows that women who ate at least one serving of fullfat dairy a day gained 30 percent less weight over a nineyear period than women who ate only lowfat or no dairy products unfortunately many people are still shunning healthy foods like raw butter and grassfed beef which contain saturated fat because they believe it will cause heart disease in reality saturated fats are among the healthiest fats you can consume could this saturated fat actually prevent liver disease saturated fats provide the building blocks for your cell membranes and a variety of hormones and hormonelike substances that are essential to your health and saturated fats from animal and vegetable sources such as meat dairy certain oils and tropical plants like coconut provide a concentrated source of energy in your diet that has farreaching health benefits unfortunately nearly the entire conventional media and nearly every health expert will disagree with the above and use statements that all the research supports their belief well the truth of the matter is that it doesnt gary taubes has provided the best rebuttal to this concept in the book he wrote good calories bad calories gary is one of the leading science journalists and he devoured the literature on this and reviewed all the studies and he expertly debunks their flawed logic and details how this misunderstanding has contributed to the epidemic of chronic disease in the u s additionally new research this year showed that mediumchain triglycerides such as those found in coconut oil helped to stop the development of fatty liver in rats saturated fats also act as carriers for important fatsoluble vitamins a d e and k dietary fats are also needed for the conversion of carotene to vitamin a for mineral absorption and for a host of other biological processes saturated fats are also the preferred fuel for your heart and also used as a source of fuel during energy expenditure useful antiviral agents caprylic acideffective as an anticaries antiplaque and antifungal agent lauric aciduseful to actually lower cholesterol levels palmitic and stearic acidsmodulators of genetic regulation and prevent cancer butyric acidas for the belief that these healthful fats will cause heart disease research again shows this is simply untrue a 2010 study in the american journal of clinical nutrition which reviewed 21 studies relating to the risk of heart disease stroke and saturated fats found that… there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of chd coronary heart disease or cvd stroke and cardiovascular disease what is the true dietary villain for your weight if you are serious about losing weight you have got to strictly limit the amount of fructose in your diet as evidence is mounting that excess sugar and fructose in particular is the primary factor in the obesity epidemic the central issue is that fructose is now used in virtually all processed foods whether youd suspect the food would contain a sweetener or not if you want to lose weight cutting soda from your diet is essential … but  and this is a point many fail to appreciate  youve got to cut other sources of fructose too including that in processed foods fruit juice excessive fruit and socalled  healthy sweeteners like agave ideally you should keep your total fructose consumption below 25 grams per day and this includes fruits this is especially true if you have insulin resistance and are overweight

weight by fooling your metabolism as it turns off your bodys appetitecontrol system fructose does not appropriately stimulate insulin which in turn does not suppress ghrelin the hunger hormone and doesnt stimulate leptin the satiety hormone which together result in your eating more and developing insulin resistance rapidly leads to weight gain and abdominal obesity beer belly decreased hdl increased ldl elevated triglycerides elevated blood sugar and high blood pressure—ie classic metabolic syndrome over time leads to or worsens preexisting insulin resistance which is not only an underlying factor of type 2 diabetes and heart disease but also many cancers according to dr robert lustig fructose is isocaloric but not isometabolic this means you can have the same amount of calories from fructose or glucose fructose and protein or fructose and fat but the metabolic effect will be entirely different despite the identical calorie count this is a very important point so let me repeat it most will need to read this seven times or more to fully realize the implications of this simple yet highly profound and radically revolutionary important statement fructose is isocaloric but not isometabolic this means you can have the same amount of calories from fructose or glucose fructose and protein or fructose and fat but the metabolic effect will be entirely different despite the identical calorie count this is largely because different nutrients provoke different hormonal responses and those hormonal responses determine among other things how much fat you accumulate this is why counting calories alone is often not enough to lose weight successfullyeven the most popular caloriecounting weight loss program weight watchers recently admitted this fact and changed their wildly successful formula the new system instead tries to encourage dieters to consume more natural less processed food which i believe is the crux of any longterm weight loss program what you need to know to finally lose weight for the majority of people severely restricting carbohydrates such as sugars fructose and grains in your diet will be the key to weight loss refined carbohydrates like breakfast cereals bagels waffles pretzels and most other processed foods quickly break down to sugar increase your insulin levels and cause insulin resistance which is the number one underlying factor of nearly every chronic disease and condition known to man including weight gain as you cut these dietary villains from your meals you need to replace them with healthy substitutes like vegetables proteins and fats your body prefers the carbohydrates in vegetables rather than grains and sugars because it slows the conversion to simple sugars like glucose and decreases your insulin level when you cut grains and sugar from your meals you typically will need to radically increase the amount of vegetables you eat as well as make sure you are also consuming protein and healthy fats regularly ive detailed a stepbystep guide to this type of healthy eating program in my comprehensive nutrition plan and i urge you to consult this guide if you are trying to lose weight finally remember that the foods you choose to eat will be the driving force behind successfully achieving your weight loss goals  even more so than exercise its important to realize that exercise  even if you incorporate exercises like peak 8 into your routine  will not compensate for fructose use and can destroy many of the benefits of your hard work exercise is still important for weight loss and optimal health …
