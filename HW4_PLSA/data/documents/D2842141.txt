upward water transport in trees occurs in cells known collectively as xylem these include tubelike cells called tracheids and vessel elements these join together to form vertically oriented tubes reaching from the roots to the leaves two forces combine to move water upward in these tubes root pressure and transpiration root pressure occurs when water flows into the roots through osmosis due to differences in the concentration of solutes between the soil and roots this higher pressure in the roots exerts a slight upward force on the fluid column transpiration occurs when water evaporates from leaf surfaces causing a lower pressure in the leaves this also exerts a slight upward force on the fluid column the xylem conduits are small diameter and act as capillaries the adhesion of liquid to the inner capillary walls counteracts gravity and keeps the water column from falling the slight upward forces of root pressure and transpirational pull are enough to move the fluid upward there are minor variations on this among the vascular plants and the physical limits to capillary action and the magnitude of the various forces are what limit potential height growth of trees if anything causes a gap in the water column cavitation the system can break down and the flow stops pressure from below is already used in many places to move water for human use natural springs or wells drilled into aquifers under pressure are quite common in rural areas for moving water without pumps suction from above is the basis for most pumping systems creating a pump that relied on negative pressure created by evaporation is certainly possible but wildly inefficient trees use the water for photosynthesis as it passes through the leaves but evaporate far more molecules of water through their leaf stoma than they use in the photosynthetic process using evaporation to transport water for human use would mean that most of your water would be lost to the atmosphere i like the concept of using capillary action by building well pipes as a collection of very small vessels while the adherence of water to the vessel walls would reduce the upward force needed by a pump it would also decrease the speed with which water could be drawn through the pipe247k views · view upvoters · answer requested by russell stadler your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to date
