from a local shop and want to know if this is reasonable for a pair of polarised ray bans and with my health fund itll cost me 320 is this a good deal eta to make sense edited by aimless 15 september 2013  0913 am2girlo posted 15 september 2013  0929 ami think it depends largely on your prescription i had my eyes layered so it has been a while since i bought glasses but each lense used to cost me 250 plus frames so 320 total doesnt sound too bad to me3rosie28posted 15 september 2013  1011 amit sounds ok to me but it really depends on the brand of frame and your prescription4iheartu posted 15 september 2013  1011 amyou could go to somewhere like specsavers or kevin paisley and get 2 pairs for that i paid 350 for 2 x pairs of designer frames with anti glare protection i dont have a health fund so theyd be even cheaper than that they let you choose if you want sunnies or regular so you could get one of each if you wanted to5three of hearts posted 15 september 2013  1023 ami agree it depends on the brand of the frame the prescription to go in it and also the size of the lenses i picked out a lovely big pair of versace sunnies a few years ago i think the frames were 400 but by the time i paid for the lenses to go in them they were nearly double that 6esme lennox posted 15 september 2013  1035 amyeah depends on frame  lenses just a tip single vision stock lenses are usually fine in sunglasses the tint helps to hide the thickness of the lens and the frame is usually thicker too my last pair i got stock single vision polarised lenses in a standard frame not designer i think they cost about 120 after health insurance rebate the 120 was for the polarisation would have cost nothing otherwise 2 for 1 specsavers7annodam posted 15 september 2013  1052 ammine were 750 way back in 1993 which is why ive still got the same pair i mainly wear them for driving though  they stay in the car 247 and no my prescription hasnt changed otherwise id be getting a new pair obviously i see my ophthalmologist every 2 years so im on top if there are any changes8elmomum posted 15 september 2013  1102 amyep sounds reasonable i paid about 400 out of pocket im with bupa sunglasses from opsm for oakleys9noonehere posted 15 september 2013  1104 ami pay nothing out of pocket for two pairs single vision through bupa and specsavers10holley shiftwell posted 15 september 2013  1131 amyep its more to do with the frames cost and who your insurer is if you have it11andieinvic posted 15 september 2013  1137 amive just ordered some from opsm im paying 350 after opsm 20 discount and bupa claim of 170 seems a lot  but must admit i could have gone cheaper frames but really liked these and promised myself i would have them for yearsedited by andieinvic 15 september 2013  1138 am12i mumposted

frames14unicycle posted 15 september 2013  0415 pmi agree with doing it online so much cheaper15coffeegirl posted 15 september 2013  0607 pmi got a quote from opsm for rayban prescription sunglasses with polorised lenses i only need them for distance and driving and they are a very light script opsm quote before my phi rebate 580 phi rebate would be 180 took the frame number and went to my local optomotrist they quoted me 360 for same frames and lenses before my phi rebate phi rebate was 180 went to bupa optical and they quoted me 400 but i would be able to get my full rebate amount of 240 back wont be going back to opsm ever16julie3girls posted 15 september 2013  0726 pmreally depends on your script and what you have done to the lens then cost of the frames  expensive frames will make for more expensive glasses i know when i was in high school i got a pair of oakleys made up in prescription glasses  i was so excited to have fashionable sunglasses that meant i looked the same as my friends17alexx28posted 15 september 2013  0852 pmi had my 1yr old ray ban wayfarers polarised lenses removed to have prescription lenses fitted and it was 350 i didnt get them polarised because it was going to cost more i would love to have a back up pair other choice of sunnies made up and stashed away but too expensive18kylie yposted 16 september 2013  0631 ami agree with all pp it depends on your script and the frame you choose just last week i purchased a pair from specsavers and i was rapt with the price 369 i have a high index lens prediction and usually pay around 450 to 50019cward posted 16 september 2013  0101 pmanother one who was coming in to say go to zenni they are awesome i have thick lenses so even to get them thinner and with the lenses that change outside and in it only cost me 12920kyposted 17 september 2013  0212 ami just paid 650 out of pocket after private health for a pair of ordinary glasses and a pair of prescription sunnies what is annoying is that i had to buy all new because my eyesight has changed for the better i dont have a notation on my drivers license with regard to wearing glasses as my eyesight is good enough to pass the test without them but i prefer to wear glasses as a peace of mind measure when driving i notice the difference and the improvement in clarity that wearing my glasses makes is worth it i love my sunnies i didnt buy them for how they look but rather for their coverage  they keep my eyes well protected and are lovely and dark apparently they dont look too bad on but i dont care in all honesty as they are for driving

pairs with my health fund polarisation is more expensive though back to what do you think · next unread topic →0 user s are reading this topic0 members 0 guests 0 anonymous users
