identity disorder transvestic fetishisim posttraumatic stress disorder schizophrenia pathological gambling delusional disorder anorexia nervosa cyclothymic disorder in order to better illustrate the features of the most commonly diagnosed mental illnesses the below case studies are presented major depressive disorder name eeyore source winnie the pooh tv show 1966 background information eeyore is an older gray donkey there are no documents indicating the exact age or specified background information and he chooses not to share this information eeyore does not have an occupation his health compared to other donkeys is slightly underweight but slender he chooses not to share his family background one main difficulty eeyore has elaborated on is his detachable tail which seems to cause him several problems he has indicated that his goals are to remain strong for his friends despite his lack of confidence within himself and as a result he often feels lonely without support from others that he is close to some forms of coping mechanisms include trying to feel useful in the presence of others and also trying his best to find pleasure in life description of the problem eeyore constantly insists that his tail falls off rather frequently eeyore’s posture typically involves a slumped head droopy eyes and commonly says “thanks for noticing me” sluggish movement is also apparent without any physical cause for movement delay he seems to step on his tail often and fall down eeyore indicates that sometimes it seems that even his close friends do not need him around friends he typically makes comments about his relative unimportance and travels near the back of the pack he also stated that although he tries to force a smile a real smile has not existed in a long time even though others try to cheer him up he often feels empty even when accompanied by friends eeyore also seems to experience a loss of energy throughout the day although sleeping habits are not explicitly expressed diagnosis2962x major depressive disorder single episode eeyore exhibits five symptoms of a major depressive episode and has also experienced these for several years therefore meeting full criteria criteria met include depressed mood most of the day markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day feelings of worthlessness and diminished ability to think or concentrate were indicated overall eeyore exhibits severe clinical major depression without psychotic features further diagnosis will be needed to determine catatonic melancholic or atypical features as details are limited at this point postpartum onset is not a factor accuracy of portrayal eeyore is a character that displays a relatively accurate example of major depressive disorder one major issue with the character portrayed is his consistent involvement with a support group a lack of interest in activities is common with this disorder causing most persons with depression to not frequently spend time with others this is in contrast to eeyore who seems to be surrounded by friends much of the time also his support groups seems rather sarcastic at times as well as exhibiting their own issues so it may be hard to diagnose if environmental factors may prolong the depression longer than it may otherwise last some would argue that this may be closer to a diagnosis of dysthymia but since eeyore seems to exhibit more severe symptoms closer to major depression and each season of the show lasts less than two years it is hard to fully identify a long term timespan of his disorder treatment although various treatments exists i would recommend cognitive behavioral therapy and possibly electroconvulsive therapy if cbt does not work alone since donkeys have not been tested with medication normally given to persons suffering from depression i would not advise any type of tricyclics mao inhibitors or ssris be used regarding cognitive behavioral therapy it is important that eeyore first understands the relationship between events emotions and cognitions as mentioned he must first realize that if his tail falls off that he is not less of an individual furthermore he must also realize that the need to be of worth can be selfinduced and that he does not need to rely on others to find this feeling treatment would then be followed by instructing eeyore on identifying evaluating and modifying automatic negative though patterns that exist he acknowledges his feelings of worthlessness but also having the tools to evaluate his negative thoughts as something he can control should enable him to eventually take control over his thoughts stress management social skills and activities training will then follow to give eeyore a path to improve his wellbeing by being able to optimally connect with others and join in on activities that spark his interests name anthony soprano jr source the sopranos television series 19992005 background information anthony soprano jr referred to as a j is a male born on july 15 1986 to anthony and carmela soprano the family is of italian decent and they live in new jersey from a very young age a j had disciplinary problems in school and a possible learning disability after extensive testing and meeting with school counselors he was deemed to be suffering from attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder it was very obvious throughout the various seasons that a j had a strong family history of multiple psychiatric disorders his father was diagnosed with depression from the beginning of the series he was on medication and would see a therapist regularly in addition his father had antisocial personality disorder and panic disorder without agoraphobia his father was involved in organized crime which caused strains on his parents’ relationship due to these marital issues between his parents a j would often act out during their period of separation and possible divorce as a j got older his father insisted on him becoming more responsible and not a failure in life as a way to make a j more productive his father got him a job at a construction site a j started the job and was doing well he met a puerto rican girl named blanca at the construction site and they started dating the two became really close and a j eventually proposed to blanca after some reconsideration she decided that a j was not right for her and broke up with him this is when he became depressed a j continued to work at the construction site for some time but the site of blanca talking to other men became too much for him so he eventually quit just as things seemed like they would never improve a j met some childhood friends whose fathers were also in the mafia with his father he started hanging out with them and seemed to be improving he also began seeing a therapist and was prescribed prozac he improved to the point that he even began to take some college courses however these new friends turned out to be a bad influence they were running some illegal gambling on campus and would use violence to collect money a j did not seem to be affected by this but when they badly beat up an african american student this sent a j spiraling down once again description of the problem after the breakup with blanca a j started sleeping all the time and would not come out of his room he had a decreased appetite and anhedonia he seemed to lack energy for quite some time there were no suicidal ideations initially after the africanamerican student incident he again confined himself to his room and developed similar symptoms to what he was displaying after his break up with blanca it progressed to the point that he attempted to kill himself by tying a plastic bag around his face wrapping a cinder block around his leg and jumping in the pool while his parents were out of the house luckily his father came home and saved him prior to there being any significant damage a j was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility and received the therapy he needed diagnosis the diagnosis for a j soprano is major depressive disorder recurrent 2963x according to the dsmivtr the following are eight of nine criteria that are met for the diagnosis 1 depressed mood most of the day nearly every day as indicated by either subjective report eg feels sad or empty or observation made by others eg appears tearful note in children and adolescents can be irritable mood a j exhibits a depressed mood consistently for at least two weeks in both of his major depression episodes2 markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities most of the day nearly every day as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by othersa j’s mother noticed that he quit attending his job at the pizza parlor even though he used to enjoy working there3 significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain eg a change of more than 5 of body weight in a month or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day note in children consider failure to make expected weight gains a j’s mother would constantly cook different things that a j used to enjoy before his decrease in appetite but none of the things she cooked seemed appealing to him4 insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day a j could be seen sleeping throughout most of the day due to his depression5 psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day observable by others not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed downthis is the only criterion that does not pertain to a j6 fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day a j appeared to be tired at all times of the day7 feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt which may be delusional nearly every day not merely selfreproach or guilt about being sickafter blanca broke up with him a j appeared to have feelings of worthlessness8 diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly every day either by subjective account or as observed by othersa j stopped attending his college classes due to his inability to concentrate9 recurrent thoughts of death not just fear of dying recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide a j actually attempts suicide but failed to drown himself■ specify■ longitudinal course specifiers with and without interepisode recoverya j displays interepisode recovery between his two major depressive episodes making his a case of major depressive disorder recurrent accuracy of portrayal the average person watching a j on the sopranos would receive an accurate portrayal of major depressive disorder recurrent he displays a majority of the symptoms for the disorder in both episodes he has had these breaks of normalcy between the two episodes are crucial in understanding major depression episodes especially when the depression is recurrent major depressive disorder is highly heritable so watching a j’s father who also displays signs of depression helps to understand some of the genetic influence on depression treatment proper treatment of a j’s major depressive disorder would given his severe symptom levels include beginning with antidepressant medication psychotherapy might also be added in a j case in order to increase effectiveness of treatment it does not seem that electroconvulsive therapy would be necessary in a j’s case since he does not exhibit psychotic symptoms or catatonia alzheimers dementia name alice howland source still alice by lisa genova book 2007 background information alice howland is a caucasian female who is 50 years old she currently works as a cognitive psychology professor at harvard university overall howland presents as a healthy 50yearold woman howland is a petite woman but not underweight howland remains active in her work and social life and other than leading a hectic life appears happy howland lives with her husband john and the two have three grown children all of which live out of the home howland maintains many close friendships and is in a stable longterm relationship howland

father was an alcoholic and that they did not have much contact over the last several years before his death description of the problem howland frequently exhibits disorientation and gets lost when she is only a few blocks from her home she recognizes the building and knows that she is supposed to know how to get home but her mind is blank howland frequently misplaces items and is unable to find them at times she replaces items and later finds the lost item she frequently loses her train of thought or is unable to remember significant details of her life as a professor she often visited other universities as a guest speaker or would present at conferences lately she would lose track near the middle to end of her lecture and have to refer to her notes this was not common for howland as she used her speeches repeatedly only making small changes that were easy to remember howland reports forgetting words during a lecture she states that it is not even on the tip of her tongue the word is just completely gone from her memory howland recently missed a conference in chicago simply because she forgot about it howland also states that she has to write down a detailed schedule of what time and where her classes are or she will simply forget to go teach them diagnosis dementia of the alzheimers type 2941x· diagnostic criteriao a the development of multiple cognitive deficits manifested

suffering from any central nervous system conditions systemic conditions or substanceinduced conditions she is having difficulties at work due to her memory loss unlike her previous performance in her job her memory loss and confusion began gradually and steadily worsened code based on presence or absence of a clinically significant behavioral disturbance· 29410 without behavioral disturbance if the cognitive disturbance is not accompanied by any clinically significant behavioral disturbance· 29411 with behavioral disturbance if the cognitive disturbance is accompanied by a clinically significant behavioral disturbance eg wandering agitation howland does not present with any behavioral disturbances at this time· specify subtypeo with early onset if onset is at age 65 years or belowo with late onset if onset is after age 65 years· coding note also code 3310 alzheimers disease on axis iii indicate other prominent clinical features related to the alzheimers disease on axis i eg 29383 mood disorder due to alzheimers disease with depressive features and 3101 personality change due to alzheimers disease aggressive type howland’s diagnosis falls under the early onset subtype as she is only 50 years old· epidemiologyo the prevalence rates of dementia of alzheimers type increases dramatically with increasing age rising from 6 in males and 8 in females at age 65 to 11 in males and 14 in females by age 85 as age increases so do the prevalence rates at age 90 the rates rise to 21 in males and 25 in females and by age 95 the prevalence rates are as high as 36 in males and 41 in females unfortunately 4060 are moderate to severe cases howland was unaware of her extended families medical history because her mother passed at a young age and her father to her knowledge did not display any symptoms before his death accuracy of portrayal overall the book accurately displays the course of early onset alzheimer’s the high and lows of mood as the disease progresses are genuine and show the true emotions that not only a person suffering from the disease deals with but what family members and friends deal with the book also shows how the disease progresses somewhat slowly at first and then a continual decline in functioning not only mentally but also physically the rate at which each person declines is different but overall the beginning is gradual and then the decline seems to speed up it does seem as if the book may have sped up the disease a bit much the confusion and slight memory loss that progresses into complete memory loss and description of living with strangers does seem to ring true a person with this disease must frequently feel as if she is with strangers even when she is with her own family the book did not go into the very late stages of the disease at which time those with alzheimer’s physical decline is serious and require feeding tubes and most usually hospitalization or nursing home care as they are no longer able to walk feed themselves or even speak treatment at this time there are no medications available to cure alzheimer’s only medications that seem to slow the progression for alice howland the best course of treatment would include cholinesterase inhibitors during the beginning stages and an nmethyl daspartate nmda antagonist once symptoms become more severe in nature these medications only slow the progression of the disease although these medications have been effective in slowing the progression of alzheimer’s in many patients when the disease presents itself as a safety issue for howland forgetting that she is cooking wandering off and getting lost or unable to take care of her personal daily needs she needs either nursing home care or 24hour home care when howland reaches the stage where she is no longer able to feed herself or walk nursing home care is the best recourse for proper care a healthy diet recommendation through all stages of the disease by limiting unhealthy food intake and eating healthy may help slow the progression of alzheimer’s however this is in combination with proper medication as long as she is able exercise reading crossword puzzles and other mentally and physically stimulating activities may help slow the progression of the disease however there is not adequate research into this area name fiona anderson source away from her movie 2006 background information fiona anderson is a caucasian female in her late 60’searly 70’s she is fit for her age not overweight or underweight fiona’s family originates from iceland but she was raised in canada she is married to grant anderson for 44 years and they have no children fiona is currently unemployed after grant retired from his job as a professor the couple moved to brandt county ontario the couple currently lives in the farmhouse that belonged to fiona’s grandparents and have lived there for 20 years fiona lives an active lifestyle by going on cross country skiing trips around their property with her husband the couple will occasionally see their other married friends but most live far away there is no known drug or alcohol problem fiona has the occasional drink at home with her husband but in no way ever appears to have had too much there is a subject matter that has remained unresolved between fiona and her husband while grant was still teaching there was speculation and rumors that he had an affair with one of his students fiona instead of enraged by grant’s adultery was thankful that he did not leave her in order to make a better life for themselves and they moved away from all the distractions fiona seems to have dealt with grant’s unfaithfulness and her deteriorating memory with a great deal of acceptance and dignity description of the problem fiona exhibits the early signs of memory loss when she is helping put away the dishes she forgets pauses puts the frying pan in the freezer and walks away her memory loss then progresses to where she has to put labels on all the cabinets and drawers of what belongs where fiona admits that at times she forgets what words mean like the word yellow fiona forgets how to say “wine” while offering her guest another glass during her evaluation she is asked a series of questions involving mail she answers the majority of the questions correct but then forgets where a person would take the mail to send it fiona becomes even more disoriented as time goes by and loses her way home and wanders off her husband is constantly finding things that she has left undone or forgot about such as when she put a pot of water on to boil then left the house the most recent development of fiona’s memory degrading happened after she was admitted to meadowlake a care taking facility after being separated from her husband for only 30 days she seemed to have lost all knowledge of their married life she exhibited recognition of his face but not what they meant to each other or the life they shared fiona begins to form an attachment with a man who is in meadowlake with her when asked about him she states “i like aubrey because he doesn’t confuse me” diagnosis dementia of the alzheimers type 2941xdiagnostic criteria a the development of

better accounted for by another axis i disorder eg major depressive disorder schizophrenia fiona meets criteria for a1 and a2 the cognitive disturbances that she exhibits are aphasia agnosia and possible impaired ability to carry out particular motor abilities the impairments from criteria a1 and a2 have affected her relationship with her spouse friends and how she interacts with others as well as her daily activities fiona does not have any recorded nervous system substanceinduced or systemic conditions that could impair her memory fiona’s memory loss has had a continuous decline and started gradually she is not recorded to have any other axis i disorders code based on presence or absence of a clinically significant behavioral disturbance29410 without behavioral disturbance if the cognitive disturbance is not accompanied by any clinically significant behavioral disturbance29411 with behavioral disturbance if the cognitive disturbance is accompanied by a clinically significant behavioral disturbance eg wandering agitation fiona has presented some behavioral disturbances such as wandering the street and woods accuracy of portrayal overall the movie provides an accurate portrayal of the disease and the effects it has on the person suffering from it a person not knowing anything about alzheimer’s would learn from the movie that with time that shortterm or working memory starts to diminish first a person suffering from alzheimer’s will gradually lose more of their memory abilities eventually impairing their longterm memory and recall they will also learn that people with alzheimer’s can know someone one day but not know them the next they may also repeat the same questions or statements having no recollection of already saying them in the movie they say fiona is young for already having alzheimer’s which is not entirely accurate as she is beyond the age of 65 this puts her in the late onset category which is more common than early onset treatment there is no current cure for alzheimer’s but there are medications shown to help slow the progression of the disease the food and drug administration has approved two types of drugs that could help fiona cholinesterase inhibitors and mematine a good diet and exercise will also help in creating a good environment for the medication to work and help fiona stay mentally alert it would also be beneficial to keep the mind working by taking part in any sort of puzzles that help exercise the brain in the movie they admitted fiona into a caretaking facility not too long after she was diagnosed with the disease in my opinion they could have waited longer to admit her her memory seemed to deteriorate faster after she was in the care of the home tourettes disorder name lionel essrog source motherless brooklyn by jonathan lethem book 1999 background information lionel essrog is a caucasian male and presumably in his mid to late thirties lionel essrog is an orphan and the whereabouts of his biological parents is unknown essrog spent his childhood and adolescence in the st vincent’s home for boys in brooklyn new york which is a publicly funded boarding house for orphaned young males the residents of st vincent’s are required to attend public school and essrog acquired his high school diploma but has not received any further education essrog currently works for a man named frank minna with three other of his housemates from st vincent’s the four of them call themselves “minna men” and they specialize in unconventional and frequently illegal types of jobs as provided by frank minna any familial mental health history is unknown essrog has no history of drug or alcohol abuse he does not seem to have any long term goals other than to continue working for frank minna beginning in early childhood essrog began experiencing compulsions which involved twitching and jerking his neck these compulsions soon turned into various forms of motor tics including incessant tapping of the metalpipe legs of schoolroom desks and chairs as if in search of certain ringing tones reaching for doorframes and kneeling to grab at untied shoe laces of other classmates one of his compulsions actually involved grabbing and kissing his fellow classmates and housemates at st vincent’s because of his behavior essrog did not have very much social interaction with peers his age and spent a lot of time alone around the time he was thirteen years old the kissing compulsion ended but was replaced with others he was prone to tapping whistling tongueclicking winking rapid head turns wall stroking and other various tics during this time essrog began experiencing rapid thoughts that were becoming more and more of a compulsion to speak out loud many of these thoughts were echoic variations to things he heard for example when essrog heard “alfred hitchcock” he would silently rephrase it as “altered houseclock” essrog found it more and more difficult to withhold these compulsions and began exhibiting simple vocal tics by barking like a dog and chirping like a bird while he still has the compulsion to do simple vocal tics he also exhibits complex vocal tics as well description of the problem essrog currently displays simple and complex motor tics as well as simple and complex vocal tics examples of simple motor tics are eye blinking nose wrinkling neck jerking shoulder shrugging facial grimacing and abdominal tensing complex motor tics include hand gestures jumping touching pressing stomping facial contortions repeatedly smelling an object squatting deep knee bends retracing steps twirling when walking and assuming and holding unusual postures including dystonic tics such as holding the neck in a particular tensed position simple vocal tics include meaningless sounds such as throat clearing sniffing grunting snorting and chirping complex vocal tics more clearly involve speech and language and include the sudden spontaneous expression of single words or phrases speech blocking sudden and meaningless changes in pitch emphasis or volume of speech palilalia repeating one’s own sounds or words and echolalia repeating the lastheard sound word or phrase essrog also shows coproplalia which is the sudden inappropriate expression of a socially unacceptable word or phrase essrog describes his vocal tics as follows “my words begin plucking at threads nervously seeking purchase a weak point a vulnerable ear it’s an itch at first inconsequential but that itch is soon a torrent behind a straining dam once i’m able to scratch that itch it let’s off the pressure in my head and i am able to concentrate” essrog’s tics cause him anxiety in social situations but the men with whom he works have learned to accept his behavior essrog also claims that his tics are more difficult to suppress when he is anxious or nervous diagnosis the diagnosis that seems to fit appropriately for essrog is tourette’s disorder 30723diagnostic criteria for tourette’s disorder dsmivtra both multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics must be present at the same time although not necessarily concurrently essrog exhibits multiple motor and vocal tics b the tics must occur many times a day nearly every day usually in bouts nearly everyday or intermittently over more than one year and during this period there must not have been a ticfree period of more than three consecutive months essrog’s experiences tics everyday and has not shown any evidence of a ticfree period c the onset is before age 18 years essrog’s symptoms began in early childhood motor tics normally develop at about 6 – 7 years of age and vocal tics normally occur at after the onset of motor tics essrog’s onset fits this criteria d the disturbance must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance eg stimulants or general medical condition eg huntingtons disease or positive encephalitis essrog shows no signs of substance abuse or any symptoms of medical conditions accuracy of portrayal jonathan lethem’s characterization of lionel essrog was very accurate in the portrayal of a person diagnosed with tourette’s disorder the age of onset was the same as listed in the dsmivtr and the description of the compulsions and tics the character exuded were also accurately portrayed when compared to the diagnostic criteria of tourette’s disorder treatment treatment for essrog should include a specific kind of psychotherapy the primary supported therapy for tourette’s disorder is habit reversal training hrt commonly known now as cognitivebehavior intervention for tics cbits in hrt a person first learns to know when and where heshe is going to have a tic followed by development of competing responses that prevent you from physically being able to perform the tic these responses are held until the urge to tic dissipates over time particularly with motor tics the client learns that they do not need to tic to feel the release and relaxation in many cases tourette’s disorder can be effectively managed if the tourette’s disorder is severe enough antipsychotic medications can be helpful these include but are not limited to chlorpromazine haloperidol and pimozide the severity of the tics may be exacerbated by administration of central nervous system stimulants such as those used in the treatment for attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder alternative treatments for treating tourette’s disorder have proven to be helpful for some patients these treatments are herbal medicines nutritional vitamin and mineral supplements and behavioral therapies it should be known that these treatments should be used as complementary and never as a substitute antisocial personality disorder name the grinch source how the grinch stole christmas movie 2000 background information the grinch who is bitter and cavedwelling creature lives on the snowy mount crumpits a 10000 foot high mountain that is north of whoville his age is

use the grinch did have some life difficulties when he was a little boy being made fun of the way he looks at his school the grinch had no goal in his life except to stop christmas from happening the

now is the mayor of the town the grinch threw a fit and picked up the christmas tree and threw it to the other side of the classroom after that he no longer liked christmas years and years later the

ahead to know what the consequences would be as he went to cindy lou who’s house to steal their tree and present cindy lou asked him why he was taking the christmas tree he told her that he going take the tree to his place and fix the light bulb the grinch did not show any remorse of what he did he wanted christmas to be over he also did not care for the safety of other including his dog his dog had to be the reindeer the grinch was irresponsible and thinking recklessly he wanted everyone miserable and thought that would make him feel better diagnosis the diagnosis that seems appropriate for

started showing symptoms around when he was 810 years old d the occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or a manic episode during observation the grinch did not meet any signs showing schizophrenia but he was showing some of the signs of having a manic episode such as increased in goaldirect activities the grinch was very into making everyone’s christmas miserable accuracy of portrayal the average person watching this movie would learn quite a bit about antisocial personality disorder they would also learn about bullying and depression the movie did make it into fairy tale where they have happy ending for a person who has antisocial personality disorder this is not the case in the real world with people who have that type of disorder it does not cure them that quick it takes time efforts and counseling though it is rare for someone who has antisocial personality disorder to seek help and get counseling it does confuse the audience that makes them think you can cure the disorder quick when you can’t this is a movie somehow helps show people what the antisocial personality is treatment antisocial personality disorder is one of the most difficult personality disorders to treat because people who have it tend to think there is nothing wrong with them and do not want help it is rare for people who have antisocial personality disorder to get help first to treat the grinch he needs a full medical examination to see what symptoms would come up beside antisocial personality disorder after the full evolution the grinch should seek counseling to talk about his past learn to cope what he went through and do some social skills training social skilling training would help him a lot to learn how to socialize with other people there a few medication that could help the grinch such as with his depression he could take antidepressant medication to help improve his depressed mood anger impulsivity or irritability however these medication do not directly treat the behavior that characterize antisocial personality disorder they can be useful in addressing conditions that cooccur with this condition name the joker source the

plotting to corrupt and destroy batman along with bringing the city of gotham to the ground his overall health status is unknown but to the naked eye he physically looks ill along with the deep razor cuts to both sides of the mouth representing a permanent smile psychologically he appears to suffer from antisocial personality disorder which is evident by his hasty behavior and lack of disregard to others he does not have a relationship with his parents or relatives the only social relationships he does have are those with thugs and delinquents there is no evidence of drugs or alcohol use although he reports that his father was an extremely abusive alcoholic who attacked he and his mother with a blade cutting him along the corner of his lips the only goal in the joker’s life was to destroy batman and everything in his path his only coping skill and weaknesses were to see someone other than himself get hurt along with batman he would then vanish from sight seemingly as if he had run away from his problems not wanting to face the consequences description of the problem the problems the joker displays are tremendous to begin he absolutely hates batman and everything to do with justice and peace he seems to hate everything about himself as well considering he has to hurt others around him to feel better his only purpose in life is to destroy gotham for no apparent reason and to destroy batman considering he is constantly in the joker’s way to destruction the joker wanted humans to understand that they were “bad” and destroyers when all the while he was the one committing crimes the joker expressed absolutely no empathy for his ruthless actions along with being extremely sadistic he blatantly disregarded laws and socials norms of society as a whole all of which are related to antisocial personality disorder diagnosis according to dsmivtr criteria the appropriate diagnosis would be antisocial personality disorder 3017there is a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others occurring since age 15 years as indicated by three or more of the following failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are groups for arrest the joker was constantly being arrested and reprimanded by law enforcements due to his ruthless behaviors at times it was difficult to catch the joker committing a crime but once he was he was punished for a short amount of time he would later escape to commit more crimes deceitfulness as indicated by repeated lying use of aliases or conning other for personal profit or pleasure at one time the joker dressed as bozo the clown while robbing the gotham national city bank he manipulated his whole crew into robbing the bank and told them they would all split the money however the joker ends up killing his crew and getting away with the money impulsive behavior or failure to plan ahead the joker planned seemingly impossible tasks without thinking about the consequences afterward at one time he tried to blow up the gotham general hospital hitting his detonator the majority of the bombs failed to blow therefore causing him to steal a nearby city bus as a quick getaway irritability and aggressiveness as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults without a doubt the joker was constantly fighting assaulting torturing or murdering another individual one in particular would be batman batman would fight the joker throwing him from wall to wall and all while the joker would be laughing hysterically reckless disregard for safety of self or others he cared very little about his own safety considering he told batman to run him over with his batpod this seemed to also be an attempted sign of sucide also blowing up a hospital violently blowing up a prison inmate and using innocent people as police officer targets are all ways he disregarded the safety for others consistent irresponsibility as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations the joker was never considered to have a job however he would steal to receive cash payments and money to support himself lack of remorse as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt mistreated or stolen from another the joker never apologized for his behavior nor having any remorse for killing innocent people he enjoyed chaos and hurting people along with himself he still didn’t feel remorse for being in jail considering that he brutally killed an inmate while there the individual is at least age 18 years the joker is in his late 40’s to early 50’s there is evidence of conduct disorder with onset before age 15 years it may have taken place with his abusive father when he was younger which caused the scarring on his face it is not known how old he was when this occurred the occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or a manic episode the joker’s behavior was constantly out of the norm his ruthless behavior was continual for long durations of time so the presence of a manic episode would not be unlikely accuracy of portrayal the average person watching the film would see that the joker is a typical psychopath the average person would learn the basics of antisocial personality disorder and character qualities an individual must hold in order to be classified as a psychopath however with antisocial personality disorder it seems to remit by age 40 and is known to be higher among young adults than older adults the joker seemed to peek in his violent streaks at this age another inaccurate portrayal of antisocial personality disorder being used in the film was that majority of individuals suffering from antisocial personality disorders have high amounts of drug use and abuse drug use causes individuals to perform dysfunctional and out of the norm types of behavior they seem to not care about the risk involved the joker was never seen using any types of drugs in the film he would constantly cause harm to others on his own will without the use of mind alternating drugs however there were strong accuracies of portrayal for instance he was a male came from an abusive childhood had zero empathy and performed extremely risky and ruthless behaviors the film helped show the most extreme form of antisocial personality disorder treatment antisocial personality disorder is difficult to treat considering the fact that individuals do not believe they are in need of treatment if a patient is taken into to counseling there is usually a lack of improvement as the patient is usually uncooperative the treatment that would most likely work for the joker would be treatment in longterm structured residential settings to which he would be placed in an environment in which he cannot hurt others if he modifies his behavior appropriately he will be able to earn privileges such as performing a non threatening hobby of his since the joker has not developed any healthy relationships in his lifetime using psychotherapy along with behavior modification would help developing a relationship with a therapist would probably be beneficial for him as well since the joker expressed a few signs of suicide attempts it may be that he is suffering from depression as well an antidepressant may help his depression and irritability even though antidepressants do not actually treat an individual with antisocial personality disorder they can help with these types of comorbid conditions social phobia social anxiety disordername barry egan source punchdrunk love movie 2002background information barry egan is a caucasian male in his early to midforties who lives alone in an apartment in los angeles california he is the owner of a small business that sells novelty items barry is not suffering from any known medical conditions or other health problems but appears to have some mental health concerns he is easily provoked into violent tantrums in which he punches walls breaks windows or destroys others personal property he does not appear to have any alcohol or drug dependencies in fact he appears to drink alcohol very minimally barry has seven sisters all of whom are very domineering and verbally abusive to him barry’s sisters have tormented and ridiculed him since childhood as an adult his sisters are still very controlling of his life and continue to torment him with embarrassing stories from his childhood barry has difficulty with personal relationships and appears to be lonely his goals include growing his business his hobbies include finding unbelievably good deals and repairing and learning to play the harmonium barry can be rather naïve and trusting of others which leads to being taken advantage of and making poor financial decisions description of the problem barry is currently seeking help because he feels something might be wrong and states that he “doesn’t like himself” but is unsure if this is abnormal since he is uncertain how other people are he states that he “cries a lot” barry can be described as a socially awkward individual who does not seek out or actively engage in social activity with others it appears that barry has little to no family support system and that his relationship with his seven sisters relates to his low selfesteem he constantly apologizes for things even when he did not do anything wrong and stumbles with his speech by merging words together barry becomes very anxious in social situations he endures these situations with intense anxiety and distress which sometimes can lead to a panic attack following the interaction barry has a tendency to become violent when provoked with embarrassing stories from his childhood he is known to lie and deny his actions when confronted barry is currently in a relationship with a woman he recently met the relationship appears to be a positive factor in barry’s life diagnosis the diagnosis for barry egan is social phobia 30023 according to the dsmivtr the following criteria are met a a marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others the individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be humiliating or embarrassing note in children there must be evidence of the capacity for ageappropriate social relationships with familiar people and the anxiety must occur in peer settings not just in interactions with adults barry shows fear in meeting new people or encountering people in unexpected situations he showed this in several situations for example when he met lena for the first time he was obviously uncomfortable and showing signs of fear and while at his sister’s house he also showed a marked fear of scrutiny from his sisters b exposure to the feared social situation almost invariably provokes anxiety which may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally predisposed panic attack note in children the anxiety may be expressed by crying tantrums freezing or shrinking from social situations with unfamiliar people barry’s reaction to his sisters demoralizing remarks about him from the other room was a panic attack that took the form of barry kicking out the glass at his sister’s house c the person recognizes that the fear is excessive or unreasonable note in children this feature may be absent barry did not know exactly what was wrong with himself but his attempt to reach out to his brotherinlaw showed that he knew that something was unreasonable and that he needed help d the feared social or performance situations are avoided or else endured with intense anxiety or distress barry avoided meeting lena at his sister’s house as best he could when his sister brought lena to his work to introduce the two he was extremely anxious and distressed he started fumbling all over the place unable to perform his job and having a hard time communicating with lena and his sister e the avoidance anxious anticipation or distress in the feared social or performance situation s interferes significantly with the persons normal routine occupational academic functioning or social activities or relationships or there is marked distress about having the phobia barry lived his life without much interaction with others before meeting lena although he was lonely he did not have the ability to initiate healthy interaction with others he made a call to a 900 number as a way to engage in conversation with a woman f in individuals under age 18 years the duration is at least 6 months even though barry is in his forties he has evidence of symptoms beyond 6 months according to his sisters stories of barry as a child he might have been diagnosable before 18 years of age g the fear or avoidance is not due to the direct psychological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition and is not better accounted for by another mental disorder eg panic disorder with or without agoraphobia separation anxiety disorder body dysmorphic disorder a pervasive developmental disorder or schizoid personality disorder h if a general medical condition or another mental disorder is present the fear in criterion a is unrelated to it eg the fear is not of stuttering trembling in parkinsons disease or exhibiting abnormal eating behavior in anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa barry appears not to be on any medications or illegal drugs nor does he appear to have another diagnosable mental disorder specify if generalized if the fears include most social situations also consider the additional diagnosis of avoidant personality disorderit appears that barry works well with the other men in his company although barry’s interaction with the men is limited and somewhat awkward accuracy of portrayal there are few portrayals of a main character with social phobia in movies and television barry’s character in the movie gave an excellent portrayal of someone suffering from social phobia and the struggles they must face on a daily basis the portrayal of his seven sisters gave a good indication that his upbringing was a humiliating and traumatic experience and gave insight into reasons why barry might suffer from the disorder barry’s relationship with lena is less accurate to the “reallife” relationship someone with social phobia might experience his awkward demeanor inability to maintain eye contact and lack of conversation skills were accurately portrayed the manner in which the two met was also likely since lena pursued barry and made most of the first moves in the relationship the inaccuracy is in the fact that barry and lena found love and appeared to “live happily ever after” which unfortunately does not happen for many individuals diagnosed with social phobia in addition barry’s love for lena seemed to give him the courage to confront the criminals that were taking advantage of him however it is unlikely for someone with social phobia to be assertive or confrontational these two factors do not exclude social phobia as a diagnosis for barry they are just not the norm for what one might expect for someone diagnosed with social phobia treatment cognitive behavioral therapy is likely the most effective treatment for barry this treatment will help change barry’s pattern of thought about certain events by helping barry better understand the reality of the situation and help barry focus less on the idea that he will be embarrassed or humiliated he will learn to identify and change his automatic negative thoughts he will learn that everybody makes mistakes and that sometimes being embarrassed is going to happen but it will be okay therapy will also help give him coping strategies to change his behavior in anxiety provoking situations as well as giving him the skills to help manage his emotions and violent temper exposure therapy will help barry learn that he can handle social situations without anxiety family therapy would likely not benefit barry greatly but may help enlighten his sisters on the cause and effect their actions have on others lives it would likely be most beneficial to meet with each sister one at a time with barry as opposed to as a whole group name charlie kaufman source adaptation movie 2002 background information charlie kaufman is a caucasian male in his midforties who lives with his twin brother donald in an apartment they share together he is a screenwriter who has been tasked with producing an adaptation of the book the orchid thief by susan orlean charlie appears to be suffering from some form of depression because he is constantly in doubt of his abilities to adapt the novel into a formidable screenplay which affects his daily routines and interactions with his brother there is no evidence of substance abuse either drugs or alcohol and he does not appear to be predisposed to partaking in consumption of dangerous substances charlie’s brother donald constantly agitates him because he is embarking on a career in screenwriting and charlie does not approve of his methods he is baffled when donald sells his work for a large amount of money charlie appears to have trouble with starting and maintaining close personal relationships as evidenced by his awkwardness with a former girlfriend and a waitress at a local diner he frequents he is able to start conversations but does not know how to keep them going and is not particularly skilled at inviting other people to join him in activities description of the problem charlie is a socially awkward person and although he is able to start minimal conversations with strangers and acquaintances he is very nervous and cannot seem to keep his thoughts in one particular order that would benefit the situation his family support system seems to only come from his twin brother who is almost completely opposite in terms of personality social interactivity and general comfort with life since a lot of his thoughts are narrated for the audience it is apparent that he craves relationships and people to share life experiences with but cannot bring up the courage to engage anyone past initial conversations charlie suffers from a severe case of writer’s block and takes his anger out on his brother who is subsequently flourishing in his screenwriting endeavors much to the chagrin of charlie donald seems to have picked up screenwriting and ran away with it and that bothers charlie because he deems donald an inferior screenwriter and too cliché to produce anything worthwhile charlie’s anxiety in social situations is profound and is outlined by a fantasy he indulges in regarding the diner waitress diagnosis the diagnosis for charlie kaufman is social phobia 30023 according to the dsmivtr the following criteria are met a a marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others the individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be humiliating or embarrassing note in children there must be evidence of the capacity for ageappropriate social relationships with familiar people and the anxiety must occur in peer settings not just in interactions with adults charlie shows a marked level of anxiety and fear when introduced to new people especially in social situations excellent examples of these situations are when he meets a former girlfriend’s new “friend” and when he is served by the waitress at the diner b exposure to the feared social situation almost invariably provokes anxiety which may take the form of a situationally bound situationally predisposed panic attack note in children the anxiety may be expressed by crying tantrums freezing or shrinking from social situations with unfamiliar people when charlie meets the exgirlfriend’s “friend” it is obvious that he is speechless and cannot speak to him or the exgirlfriend about his current situation the waitress at the diner also causes charlie to suffer through anxiety that freezes his conversation and makes the interaction very awkward c the person recognizes that the fear is excessive or unreasonable charlie knows that he is a socially awkward person and his continued interactions with his twin brother as well as his trip to new york to talk to susan orlean highlight his need to express himself in a socially acceptable way d the feared social or performance situations are avoided or else endured with intense anxiety or distress on the trip to new york charlie ultimately avoids speaking with susan orlean and instead attends robert mc kee’s seminars he then has donald imitate him and interview susan so he does not have to face her e the avoidance anxious anticipation or distress in the feared social or performance situation s interferes significantly with the person’s normal routine occupational academic functioning or social activities or relationships or there is marked distress about having the phobia charlie’s avoidance behaviors and awkward social interactions severely hinder him from completing the screenplay and even render his trip to new york a waste of time and ultimate threat to his life as he is not able to talk to susan orlean in person f in individuals under age 18 years the duration is at least 6 months charlie is well above the age of 18 but the film seems to suggest that his problems have persisted well beyond 6 months g the fear or avoidance is not due to the direct psychological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition and is not better accounted for by another mental disorder eg panic disorder with or without agoraphobia separation anxiety disorder body dysmorphic disorder a pervasive developmental disorder or schizoid personality disorder charlie’s social awkwardness and anxiety due to the social situations is not accounted for with any other condition or disorder he seems to be genuinely suffering from a social phobia and no drugs or alcohol influence his behaviors h if a general medical condition or another mental disorder is present the fear in criterion a is unrelated to it eg the fear is not of stuttering trembling in parkinson’s disease or exhibiting abnormal eating behavior in anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa charlie is not under the influence of any substances legal or illegal and his condition seems to be independent of any other diagnoses specify if generalized if the fears include most social situations also consider the additional diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder charlie is able to maintain a steady job do excellent work and keep relationships with coworkers and everyday acquaintances though to a minimal extent and not without awkward social interaction accuracy of portrayal charlie kaufman is an adequate representation of a person suffering from a social phobia it is not a perfect rendition but it covers the base areas well enough to establish a passing resemblance the character is not completely socially awkward as he is able to strike up a conversation a few times which do not lead to any sort of reliable close relationship charlie’s brother donald plays a nice juxtaposition to his social anxiety and awkwardness as evidenced by donald’s general openness and lack of social anxiety this suggests that as children charlie probably suffered greatly from witnessing his brother’s easiness with social situations a huge inaccuracy is the fact that charlie becomes assertive and decides to fly to new york on a whim to meet with susan orlean also his sudden insistence to check out what is going on between susan and john laroche is not typical of someone suffering from social phobia in any context although nothing good comes of these actions the sheer fact that he pushed his social anxieties aside for those particular instances does not accurately portray someone with full blown social phobia these are the only flaws portrayed by charlie and the depiction is a passable example of social phobia treatment the most effective route to take with a person suffering from social phobia would be a treatment centered on cognitive behavioral therapy this type of therapy could alter charlie’s thought processes to allow him to acclimate himself to social situations in a socially acceptable manner through cognitive behavioral therapy charlie could slowly eliminate negative thoughts attached to social situations and therefore be comfortable enough to pursue relationships outside of the scope he has become accustomed to developing his entire life he would be able to cope with social stressors such as the inevitable times when meeting new people will not go over very well and the situations in which established relationships start to deteriorate for numerous reasons slowly integrating reallife situations into the therapy exposure would then help charlie come to terms with the changes that would come in his life and set him on the path to being a socially normal person if the therapy was effective charlie would not become a new man overnight rather it would probably take years and consistent dedication to the changes to see him become adaptive to social situations borderline personality disorder name mad hatter source alice in wonderland movies 1951  2010 background information in the 1951 film mad hatter appears to be caucasian male is in his late thirties although his age is never disclosed he is a fictional character in alice’s dream in the movie there are not any known

celebration of all the other days in the year that are not one’s birthday currently the mad hatter lives in the forest that is a figmentation of alice’s dream it is unknown if the mad hatter has any family although he can be seen quite often with the hare and a little mouse the hare can be seen has having similar traits as the mad hatter not being able to sit in one spot interrupting others speaking rather fast constantly moving and appears to break teacups in the 2010 version the mad hatter appears to be living in a forest that is part of alice’s dream in which he lives with mally and the hare he appears to be in his midthirties although his age is never disclosed he is caucasian and dresses vibrant he has on a rather large top hat on which has random objects stick out of it under

orange and purple on the other eye his whole face is painted white he can be seen wearing a brown tattered suit that is randomly put together in which it matches his personality perfectly throughout the movie his parents and other family members are never disclosed although he is rather fond of the white queen and he remains loyal to her the mad hatter lost his enjoyment and became “crazy” due to the queen of hearts overtaking the white queen this happened when the jabberwocky came and destroyed the white queen’s area and caused massive damage to her property after that the mad hatter was never the same he was no longer happy description of the problem in the 1951 film the mad hatter can be seen singing and dancing with the hare they are drinking tea and while dancing they continue to pour each other tea once they discover alice has been watching them they stop their dancing and signing they run to alice to tell her  its very very rude to sit down without being invited” but quickly overcome this once she compliments them on their singing while the mad hatter is talking to alice he has his elbow in a cup of tea and at one point he even pours tea from the kettle down his shirt and makes the tea go into a cup they ask alice where she came from but never give her a chance to answer because they become distracted by clean cups they stubble upon while dancing with the hare to teach alice about what nonbirthday celebration is the mad hatter makes a cake appear in place of where his top hat was at one point he dips his plate into his tea and takes a bite out of the plate he never stays with one thing while talking to alice about birthdays he insists that she drinks some tea but as she starts to drink her tea he starts to sing “clean cup clean cup ” before alice can even take a sip of her tea he has dragged her off to the other end of the table and proceeds to ask her if she would like more tea he can hardly sit still every few minutes he is compelled to move down the table and has alice and the hare to move down with him it is clear that the character has difficulty focusing their attention to one aspect and also has difficulty remaining in one spot the hatter asks her “why is a raven like a writing desk” but never gives alice the chance to answer he quickly becomes angry when she attempts to answer the question but his attention is diverted when the white rabbit comes exclaiming he is late the mad hatter tells the white rabbit that his watch his two days old and proceeds to destroy the white rabbit’s watch by dipping it in tea and adding an assortment of food to the watch after placing all the food into the watch the hare smashes the watch with his sledgehammer and the mad hatter and he kick out the white rabbit when called to alice’s trial as a witness it he decides to throw the queen of hearts a unbirthday party but this makes the queen happy and does not last long due to alice seeing chester the cat on top of the queen’s head and the mad hatter running on top of the queen to obtain chester the cat in the 2010 film upon seeing alice approach him he climbs on the table and walks across it as he breaks plates and teacups along the way mally tells him that it is the wrong alice the mad hatter is positive that it is not the wrong alice and this is the correct one while alice is having tea with the mad hatter the hare and dormouse chester the cat appears while chester is having tea he brings up a topic that is sore for the mad hatter who instantly becomes enraged in which dormouse has to remind the mad hatter he needs to calm down he is rather protective of alice when the guards of the queen of hearts come he hides her in a tea kettle upon making sure that alice is safe mad hatter puts her on his hat after he had shrunk her and takes her for a walk while walking he starts to talk about the jabberwocky and becomes enraged when alice tells him that she will not slay the jabberwocky talking to alice about why she needs to slay the jabberwocky mad hatter becomes emotional and tells alice she has changed he continues to go to lengths to protect alice he throws his hat with her on it across the field so the queen of heart’s guards do not capture her instead they capture him he lies to the queen and tells he has not seen alice when she is clearly sitting next to the queen instead of answering the queen’s question he tells her that he is thinking of things that start with m moron mutiny murder and malice he decides to charm the queen by tell her that he wants to make her a hat for her rather large head once the white queen regained her land again the mad hatter is happy to show his happiness he does the futterwacken dance which he was not able to do when the white queen was not in power diagnosis the diagnosis the mad hatter seems to fit best is borderline personality disorder  30183 borderline personality disorder is consider a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships selfimage and affects and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts this is indicated by having 5 or more of the following characteristics being frantic to avoid abandonment either real or imagined a pattern of intense unstable interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extreme variances of idealization and devaluation he displays this among mally and the hare he is constantly changing his mood and one minute is harsh to them and the next minute he thinks they have the greatest idea ever also he instantly he is drawn to alice once he sees her he goes out of his way to protect alice from the queen of hearts identity disturbance markedly and persistently unstable selfimage or sense of self although he knows he is the mad hatter he does not seem like he knows this all the time in the 2010 version the mad hatter saw himself as being with the white queen but after the queen of heart took over he no longer knew who he was he was one minute was having tea with mally and the hare the next minute protecting alice from the queen of hearts and also he was someone that made hats impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially selfdamaging eg spending sex substance abuse reckless driving binge eating the mad hatter in the 2010 version fits this better in that he is willing to himself at risk constantly for alice he takes on the queen of hearts’ guards he repeatedly insults them and challenges them although it is never disclosed he displays a several symptoms of someone that may have substance abuse he is quick to change his behavior his moods are hardly stable they vary greatly from sadness happiness and anger his behavior is eccentric he talks in riddles and is constantly moving recurrent suicidal behavior gestures threats or selfmutilating behavior affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood eg intense episodic dysphoria irritability or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few dayshe displays this greatly he varies through multiple emotions one minute he is happy then the next minute he is angry upon seeing alice he drops what he is doing and decides to walk across the table to get to her he is happy to see her because she is the right alice and is the one that can slay the jabberwocky while chester pops in for tea and brings up the topic of the queen of hearts taking over mad hatter becomes angry instantly and cannot control his anger until mally reminds of where he is he displays symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder one minute he is talking about something and his attention becomes drifted to something else the mad hatter in the 1951 could qualify of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder due to his lack of being able to focus on one thing one minute he is telling alice to have tea but then makes everyone move down because he saw a clean cup he is constantly over talking the hare and alice his emotions are unstable he can easy become angry but can be pacified quickly both of the mad hatters are impulsive in the sense they do something without thinking about it for instance in the 2010 version the mad hatter is quick to insult the queen of hearts but is quickly able to get himself out of being killed by telling the queen he wants to make her a hat for her big head in the 1951 version the mad hatter throws the queen of hearts a unbirthday party when he is on trial for alice chronic feelings of emptiness personally i feel like he has these feelings and hides them by being eccentric reasoning for why he would have feelings of emptiness is that when the queen of hearts took over he could no longer do what he loved being with the white queen he is now living in a forest and displays multitudes of emotions rather rapidly you can sense he is hiding his true feelings depression of the white queen no longer in charge inappropriate intense anger or difficulty controlling anger eg frequent displays of temper constant anger recurrent physical fightshe becomes angry instantly when chester brings up the day of when the queen of hearts took over mally has to remind him of where he is and to control his anger transient stressrelated paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms accuracy of portrayal in a sense both mad hatters portray this disorder but the 2010 version does a better job of doing so the 2010 version shows more emotion and you can see what caused him to become eccentric his mood varies rapidly he is quick to be impulsive and has a short attention span he displays having other mental illness such as depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder his attention is constantly shifted between topics and is always moving he has a hard time sitting still he is never in one spot the depression would be due to the queen of heart coming to power she destroyed the property that he lived on it was the end of the world that he knew even though the white queen lost her power he still remained loyal to her in losing the property that he lived on and the white queen no longer being in power caused the mad hatter to be even more eccentric psychotic treatment to treat the mad hatter a diagnostic interview for borderline patients would first be given the interview looks at areas of functioning that are associated with borderline personality disorder the four areas of functioning include affect chronicmajor depression helplessness hopelessness worthlessness guilt anger anxiety loneliness boredom emptiness cognition odd thinking unusual perceptions nondelusional paranoia quasipsychosis impulse action patterns substance abusedependence sexual deviance manipulative suicide gestures other impulsive behaviors and interpersonal relationships intolerance of aloneness abandonment engulfment annihilation fears counterdependency stormy relationships manipulativeness dependency devaluation masochismsadism demandingness entitlement the best treatment for borderline personality disorder is dialectical behavior therapy this treatment focuses on the patient building a life that balances changes and handle situations that occur in their life patients with borderline personality disorder respond best to psychotherapy establishing trust between the patient and therapist is difficult to create and also maintain once established types of psychotherapy that can be used are cognitivebehavioral therapy transferencefocused therapy dialectical behavioral therapy schemafocused therapy and metallizationbased therapy also it would best to place the mad hatter in a stable environment and around people that have stable moods name ernie “chip” douglas “aka” larry tatericky ricardo the cable guy source cable guy movie 1996background information from his reminisces chip grew up in a neglected home his father was out of the picture and his mother seemed to be some sort of cocktail waitress or prostitute which is concluded from chip watching a family scene on the television and saying to his mom” when am i going to get a brother to play with” while his mother replies” honey that’s why mommy is going to happy hour” as she leaves the house now in his early thirties chip works an eccentric cable guy who has a distinct lisp the scene opens as steven kovacs waits on chip to arrive to install his cable it appears that steven has waited all day on chip finally when steven is in the shower chip arrives and starts banging on the door saying “cable guy” multiple times and with each time getting louder and more annoyed finally steven comes to the door upset that he was late and chip also becomes upset and states that he will just leave instead after steven asks chip to come inside chip starts looking around the living room for a spot to put the cable wires he starts talking to the walls in a sexual manner and even displaying gestures to the walls that makes steven uncomfortable once chip installs the cable steven asks him for free cable since his friend told him all he had to do was slip the cable guy a fiftydollar bill chip then asks steven to hang out with him later on yet steven was “busy” so chip asked again “well what are you doing tomorrow” steven agreed and chip exited saying “see you tomorrow pal” while hanging out chip takes steven to the large satellite receiver where chip becomes overly emotional about how people’s satellite usage will expand and how you will oneday play video games with your friends in vietnam afterwards steven asked what his name was and chip becomes highly emotional and explains with a dramatic monologue how it amazes him at the thought that steven wanted to know his name and goes on to say that his name is ernie douglas but everyone calls him chip after chip incentivizes his friendship with steven by giving gifts such as a new home theater system while having no regard for personal space or privacy although steven asks chip to return it chip becomes upset and says that he has given him friendship and that is greater than that stuff chip insists on awkward social activities including dinner at medieval times where chip becomes overwhelmingly aggression by competing in jousting and sword fighting with steven the next day chip ignorantly stumbles upon steven and his friends playing basketball invited himself to join them and ruined the game by breaking the goal the next day chip leaves steven thirteen messages on his machine and undoes his cable so that steven will call him chip arrives furious that he only calls when he needs something to make steven feel better about his girlfriend problems chip hosts a karaoke party with all the equipment he gave to steven and without his knowledge hires steven a prostitute whom he slept with that night outraged steven throws chip out and chip promises he will fix it by fixing it chip goes stalks steven’s girlfriend robin with her date and waits for him incognito in the bathroom and severely assaults her date then shows up at robin’s house and installs her free cable after steven tells chip he does not want to be friends anymore chip calls robin to make her paranoid about how steven is supposedly acting and then informs the police that steven has stolen property once steven is out on bail chip invites himself over to steven’s parents where he instigates a game of porno password and insinuating that he slept with robin infuriated steven punches chip and chip leaves the next day chip kidnaps robin takes her to the huge satellite dish and holds her hostage with a staple gun steven chases chip and robin up to the very top of the satellite when the helicopter shines a light on chip he hallucinates that it is his mother telling him to jump so right as the world is waiting to hear the verdict on a huge case chip jumps and lands on the receiver which knocks out the city’s cable however chip survives the fall and makes a mends with steven and robin and as the helicopter pilot airlifts chip away he calls chip pal which starts the whole cycle over again description of the problem chip shows instability with personal relationships such as friendships he becomes frantic if he believes if his friend s are abandoning him he has no job he had been fired from several cable companies in which he used different television names as his own such as larry tate which is known from “i dream of jeannie” chip has feelings of abandonment which stems from his neglectful childhood where the television raised him instead of his parents chip has intense emotional problems such as erratic acts of aggression violence revenge and dramatic emotions in terms of sobbing within moments chip can show signs that he absolutely loves his friends and then despise or hate the same friends chip shows signs of selfharming impulsivity such as reckless behavior including frequent trips to the large satellite dish drinking and hiring prostitutes his risk of suicide behavior increased when he assumed he no longer had any friends and attempted but failed at a suicide attempt diagnosis30183 borderline personality disorder dsmivtr criteria a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships selfimage and affects and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts this is indicated by having 5 or more of the following characteristics1 being frantic to avoid abandonment either real or imagined chip shows this throughout the entire movie at his multiple attempts to keep steven as his friend and then included robin into the mix and lastly the helicopter pilot2 a pattern of intense unstable interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extreme variances of idealization and devaluation chip exhibits extreme highs and lows on how he feels about himself as a good and bad friend to steven chip does this when he cooks steven breakfast after a party the next morning high then feels incredibly bad at the fact that he hired a prostitute that steven slept during the night low to fix the friendship chip goes out to make things right with steven and robin high3 identity disturbance markedly and persistently unstable selfimage or sense of self until steven’s friend did a background check it was unaware however chip was terminated from multiple cable companies where he had different alias from television shows such as ricky ricardo and larry tate even though that chip believes he is a great friend he has broken into steven’s house and disrupted his privacy by wiring cameras in steven’s home and using them as blackmail4 impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially selfdamaging eg spending sex substance abuse reckless driving binge eating it is not real clear however there were scenes of him drinking alcohol and what seems to him being either drunk or drugged in addition by hiring the prostitute for steven chip knows how to get women whether it is through giving free cable or something else5 recurrent suicidal behavior gestures threats or selfmutilating behavior chip displays few suicidal behaviors however chip did imply that he should end his life when the police shined the light on him and then plunged to what he thought would be his death chip survived the fall6 affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood eg intense episodic dysphoria irritability or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few dayswhen chip first met steven to install his cable he was very annoyed that steven took a moment to answer the door and then switched his mood to friendly when he asked steven to hang out with him another instance occurred when steven did not reply to chip’s 13 messages on the machine until steven’s cable went out and then was upset at the fact that steven only called when he needed something chip displayed signs of depression or dysphoria when he was telling steven that no one ever asked his name until then7 chronic feelings of emptiness chip appears to feel empty from an early age as he lives in a neglectful home there is no father present and a mother who goes out to happy hour in search of a man in his adult age chip feels empty because no one takes the time to ask for his name let alone befriend him8 inappropriate intense anger or difficulty controlling anger eg frequent displays of temper constant anger recurrent physical fightsfrequent temper outbursts and anger along with fights are seen throughout chip’s behavior towards steven chip has temper tantrums when steven does not want to be his friend chip becomes angry and vengeful when steven says he does not want to be his friend anymore chip shows erratic when he plays basketball with the guys and begins to name call and play “street ball” after someone runs into him chip has two physical fights one with steven at the medieval times where he comes at steven with a sword a joust and a mace the second occurrence is where he waits for robin’s date in the bathroom and assaults him until he has to be rushed to the hospital9 transient stressrelated paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms accuracy of portrayal i believe that chip matches most of the criteria of this disorder unquestionably if not perfectly his uncontrollable anger issues feelings of emptiness unstable interpersonal relationships and his abandonment issues seem to make him fit the criterion of this disorder some things that need to be addressed is the few instances of selfmutilation to himself including impulsivity and suicide behaviors more examples of suicidal tendencies needed to be seen in order to accurately diagnose him with borderline personality disorder in the movie chip only has the one instance of selfharm which was the attempted suicide and although chip portrays himself to know the prostitute he never mentions that he himself has had personal encounter with her nor does it ever show that chip was sexual impulsive with some of the criteria still uncertain chip does fit eight out of the nine characteristics treatment to accurately diagnose chip with bpd he would be given the diagnostic interview for borderline patients test the structured clinical interview scidii and the personality disorder beliefs questionnaire pdbq for treatment the best thing available is the dialectical behavior therapy in this therapy it is broken down into three focuses which would help chip survive and build a meaningful life by helping him to balance change and accepting his life’s situations first lifethreatening or harmful situations are addressed in chip’s life this would include self harm from selfmutilation or attempted suicide each instance would be dealt with accordingly then chip would be gently pushed to experience emotions that are painful for him pushing chip to experience intense emotions headon is a type of exposure with response prevention therapy as chip faces his toughest emotional outbreaks with different situations chip’s anxiety levels will eventually decrease the decreased anxiety will allow chip to experience those situations again only without the emotional outbreaks and anxiety lastly part three addresses living problems although it is unclear in the movie of chip’s living conditions this portion of the dbt will help chip feel complete as a person by feeling complete chip would be able to deal with the feelings of “emptiness” and the imagined fears of being abandoned once chip is able to cope with these feelings he will be able to identify when these feelings are beginning and be able to recognize that they are not real by being able to identify these feelings chip will be able to control his outbursts of anger and mood swings intermittent explosive disorder name matt foley source saturday night live tv series early 1990s background information matt foley is a 35 year old male motivational speaker physically he is severely overweight due to his steady diet of government cheese this may lead to high blood pressure and other health complications he also seems to have trouble breathing normally not just during his “rage” episodes he doesn’t speak of any interpersonal relationships family or other so family history and his childhood environment are unknown matt did admit openly that he is twice divorced and lives in a van down by the river and he is very unsatisfied with these two facts his social skills are very awkward when he is around people he is loud and generally awkward either not understanding social cues or more likely ignoring them he becomes very physical with others lifting them invading “personal space” and so on one episode he talked about began with shaking children to “drive his point home” that santa wasn’t real during this episode he was being paid to dress as santa at the mall at time of evaluation he had been on a coffee binge drinking it for four hours straight with the exception of his coffee spree there is no evidence or admittance of harder drug use he has little to no coping skills often reverting to yelling to relieve tension he generally frightens people with his behavior and while his goal in life is to not live in a van by the river and convincing young kids that they don’t want that too he seems unable to help himself in achieving that goal description of the problem matt foley’s personality is offsetting while he can seem overly enthusiastic it is a façade to hide his short temper his irritability is evidenced in all his mannerisms from his constant fidgeting to the way his voice grows louder the more irritated he becomes he constantly has to adjust his pants and shake out his arms to get rid of his temper “tingling” in his arms he is very short with people who think differently than he does choosing to be verbally demeaning instead of allowing them their own opinions this is costing him his audience when he gives speeches and not allowing him to form connections not being able to make positive relationships is harming his work performance and not allowing him to advance on to higher positions higher positions would mean a pay increase and allow him to move into a more permanent habitation such as an apartment or a house his explosive nature has also led him to destroy other individual’s property while at a house for a job he annihilated a coffee table in the living room he was sorry after the fact but could not seem to say anything other than “whoopsie” he also once forcefully suggested he move in with another person to set them on the right path during another episode he yelled at a mother to “shut your cake hole” and he promptly destroyed a christmas scene set at the mall yet another episode he discussed involved him interviewing a highly respected comediantalk show host conon o’brien the interview included matt yelling insults such as threatening to use the studio’s curtains to “wipe his rear end with them” his episodes last about 6 minutes specifically 5 minutes and 49 seconds and occur sporadically diagnosis diagnosis is intermittent explosive disorder dsmiv 31234 matt clearly shows an inability to control his impulses his episodes last less than a half hour at time and usually result in a physical altercation or destruction of property they are also grossly uncalled for as matt loses control “at the drop of a hat” his actions are neither planned nor used for personal gain other than to relieve his anger having no history of drug abuse or suggestion of family history of mental health it can be safely assumed that matt is not under the influence of anything other than his own unchecked rage that is his actions are not accounted for by any other mental disorder or substance abuse since matt is divorced he may have some unresolved anger issues or he may have had a tense marriage where it was not unusual for him to go into episodes matt also says he is remorseful for the destruction of property proving he does have a sense of what he’s doing is wrong similar episodes have occurred before one time involving public property at the mall the other involving verbal abuse during an interview with a wellknown comedian conan o’brien accuracy of portrayal intermittent explosive disorder is an impulse disorder that is specifically a lack of restraining anger and aggression statistically men are more likely to have imed than women the episodes are grossly out of proportion to the situation be it a yelling match or breaking something these episodes are also not accounted for by another mental disorder drug use or by any physiological condition such as brain injury dementia alzheimer’s and so on matts episodes are short in duration generally no longer than 20 minutes which is consistent with the diagnosis for imed the breaking of the table and christmas scene could also be accidental rather than purposeful but it’s still accounted for by his episode his “drug use” coffee and espresso binge is atypical but not unheard of his aggressive tendencies are interfering with his life and relationships and will continue to do so until he gets a handle on his behavior in all these ways matt is a perfect example of an individual who suffers with imed treatment as mental health professionals would agree there are a few options for matt foley empirically supported treatment for matt could include drug therapy such as βblockers α 2agonists antianxiety anticonvulsion antdepressants antipsychotics and mood stabilizers drug therapy can be used with or separate from cognitive behavioral therapy in cognitive behavior therapy individuals identify stressors that lead to episodes and how to cope or avoid them other forms of treatment include social skills training in which the individual works on improving their interpersonal skills although social skill training is a form of treatment it is less effective than drug andor cognitive behavioral therapy matt foley would benefit most from the combination of drug therapy and cognitive behavior therapy matt would be a good candidate for βblockers because they specifically block the β 1 and 2 receptors that stimulate the body into “fight or flight” mode they would also help to lower his blood pressure which may further help to reduce his stress and anxiety by strengthening his health in cognitive behavior therapy he and his therapist would work specifically on ways to control his anger or use it in more constructive ways one strategy for controlling his anger would be to record specific instances that send him into episodes knowing these situations would allow him and his therapist to work on ways to reduce his rage should these situations ever occur again intermittent explosive disorder name james howlett wolverine logan formerly

death astonishing xmen 1 1999 background information logan is more than one hundred years of age although he has the appearance and health of a man roughly 3540 years of age born james howlett he was a frail boy of poor health from alberta canada during the late 19th century he was the second son of wealthy landowners john and elizabeth howlet his mother who was institutionalized for a time following the death of her first son john jr in 1897 largely neglected james elizabeth later committed suicide he spent most of his early years on the estate grounds and had two playmates that lived on the howlett estate with him rose a redheaded girl who was brought in from town to be a companion to young james and a boy nicknamed dog who was the son of the groundskeeper thomas logan james assumed the name “logan” while living incognito following a violent incident involving his companion rose who was consequently wrongly accused of murder logan is a veteran of several conflicts and wars including world war ii he has served in covert government operations working under the title weapon x as an assassin logan worked as a miner in british columbia for a time and was highly regarded as being a hard worker he has also worked as an adventurer instructor bartender bouncer spy government operative mercenary soldier and sailor logan has an almost immunity to the intoxicating effects of alcohol but no evidence of use or abuse of any other substances is apparent logan tends to make friends easily enough but due to his violent and tragic past has difficulties with trust logan’s romantic relationships are often complicated and tedious frequently becoming situations where either his love cannot be displayed or his love is for someone committed to someone else logan’s difficulty with interpersonal relationships as well as his propensity toward violent outbursts often causes him to withdraw and spend a lot of time alone this isolation often serves as a means of coping description of the problem logan has a strong and often forceful demeanor he often engages in aggressive competitive behaviors as well as being somewhat of a bully when in certain company he seems to be tender toward women but sees other males as either competition or subordinates logan shows a generally hostile disposition as well as a tendency to engage in aggressive forms of humor in the limited instances in which he interacts with others when engaged in conversation he is often abrupt and bordering on rude logan’s wolverine’s skeleton includes six retractable onefoot long bone claws three in each arm that are housed beneath the skin and muscle of his forearms logan can at will release these slightly curved claws through his skin beneath the knuckles on each hand this ability coupled with logan’s short fuse and incredible physical ability often makes him dangerous diagnosis diagnosis intermittent explosive disorder dsmiv 31234 logan displays a number of impulsively violent outbursts many of which last only a short time but are extremely severe and destructive logan often displays violent outburst of temper threatening others even peers with physical harm as well as considerable destruction of property both with his claws as well as other means logan is quick to anger and aggress and is often severe in his reactions to perceived threats to his safety during one of his altercations with another male from his past logan inadvertently killed his childhood companion rose by impaling her with his claws one form of aggression known as amok is characterized by acute unrestrained violence typically associated with amnesia this is primarily seen southeastern asia but has also been seen in canada and the united states unlike ied amok does not occur frequently but in a single episode one reason for suspecting that logan may be suffering from this is due to two factors a logan has extreme memory loss due to having had his memories “wiped” from his consciousness after his service as weaponx b logan possesses memories of being a samurai in japan perhaps during his travels in the far east he found himself in southeastern asia the only reason for mentioning this is due to logan’s chronological age being much longer than that of a nonmutant human accuracy of portrayal being male logan is more at risk of having developed ied ied is one of the impulsecontrol disorders that involve the inability to control impulses of anger or rage and often results in violent physical outbursts or violent verbal attacks logan definitely displays these tendencies logan doesn’t seem to have any other mental disorders such as schizophrenia bipolar affecting him however during the process of “wiping” his memory a degree of brain injury may have occurred logan’s extremely reactive nature and his severity during his explosive episodes is often maladaptive and causes him to have to be transient in nature drifting from location to location rarely settling down into one specific location his romantic relationships have been complicated by his angry outbursts as well enemies he has made in the past due to his mercenary work and covert government work have caused the death of at least one potential life mate treatment since few controlled studies exist involving treatment of ied logan would probably benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy cbt helping him to identify triggers for his outbursts teaching him coping skills such as diaphragmic breathing counting and also the keeping of a stress and incident journals to help him identify what triggered specific incidents and what to do to avoid them or possibly handle them differently if a similar situation arises anger management and group therapy could also be effective as well if these were unsuccessful or only marginally effective then the use of certain medications such as anticonvulsion antianxiety mood regulators antidepressants antipsychotics betablockers alpha 2agonists or phenytoin could be indicated narcissistic personality disorder subject name jenna maroney source 30 rock television series mid 2000s background information jenna marony is a fortythree

dramatic tricks where she majored in playing prom queens and murdered runaways she has been in various films and commercial and is currently employed as an actress on a television series there is no history of substance use however there is a history of binge eating but the episode was brief and jennas eating habits have since returned to normal jenna is in good health with no reported concerns jenna seems to have coped with her life difficulties by becoming the center of attention and the center of her own universe abandoned by her father and used by her mother as a decoy jenna possibly feels unloved and rejected jennas inability to empathize with others and sustain lasting relationships with are major weaknesses she is constantly battling with someone whether it be a coworker a friend or a family member currently jenna is involved with a transvestite who dresses as jenna in fact jenna met her lover while participating in a jenna maroney lookalike contest in which jenna herself only placed fourth her new lover won the contest and they have been intimate since that time description of the problem jenna does not feel she has any problems other than not receiving the attention and recognition she feels she deserves her achievements are not commensurate with her desire to be worshipped and adored jenna feels she is entitled to special treatment and when this fails to occur within her career or social life she becomes explosive and stubborn she has an excessive need for admiration as evidenced by her choice of careers she seems to have no empathy regarding others and on the rare occasions empathy is displayed by jenna it is not genuine empathy but a means to an end in other words she fakes empathy to manipulate others or for personal gain jenna repeatedly poisoned a coworker in the hopes of dating one of the hot emt workers who came to the rescue jenna is severely jealous of her costar in her current television series and is constantly looking for ways to undermine him she dreams of unparalleled success and believes she is the most beautiful talented woman to grace this planet while jenna does not see this as a problem the rest of

unique if she is criticized she feels that the person doing the critique just doesnt understand her because they are not as special and wonderful as she diagnosis jenna best fits the diagnostic category of narcissistic personality disorder 30181 · a pervasive pattern of grandiosity in fantasy or behavior need for admiration and lack of empathy beginning by early adulthood and present in a

one is rather than guilt regret for what one has done jenna qualifies for almost every single diagnostic criteria as outlined in the description of the problem and her background information there is some overlap with histrionic personality disorder as jenna does frequently use her sexuality to gain her desires however she fits more of the narcissistic criteria than the hpd criterion accuracy of portrayal the portrayal of narcissism in this character is fairly accurate although there is some overlap with histrionic personality disorder one of the deciding factors whether this was npd or hpd was the fact that jenna falls in love with a man who dresses as her narcissus was also in love with himself and was forever doomed to gaze upon his reflection in a pool of water until he died it is said as his boat crossed over into the afterlife he leaned over to catch on last glimpse of himself in the water this is the epitome of jenna while more males than females are diagnosed with npd 7 for males and 4  for females jenna is a prime example of a female narcissist treatment narcissists rarely seek treatment as their perception is that they are better than everyone else if a narcissist does enter treatment psychotherapy is the recommended course of treatment and perhaps some group therapy if group therapy is utilized clear boundaries should be set as to respecting other people in the group prognosis poor anorexia nervosa name giselle vasco source skinny by ibi kaslik book 2004 background information giselle vasco is a twentyone year old caucasian female of hungarian decent she was the first born of two daughters after her parents thomas and vesla immigrated to the united states in the early 1970’s to escape the communist repression of their country giselle’s younger sister holly is eight years behind her in age but much like her sister has a very grounded and intellectual personality they both stand approximately five feet eleven inches tall and have a very close relationship giselle and holly are both considered accomplished in their own rights even at young ages with giselle enrolled in medical school and holly being acknowledged as a “standout athlete” at her high school at the present time giselle is home from medical school taking a leave of absence to clear her mind and regroup her life she is working at a hospital in the mental health ward as a companion to many patients it is described that after her first love had left giselle became a callous lover who would frequently sleep around  trusting nobody with her heart this stayed a constant until she met her current boyfriend solomon sol who desperately loves giselle both sisters however are plagued by the fact that their father had recently passed away due to a heart attack in the midst of this tragic loss both sisters struggle in the grieving and coping processes respectively giselle and her father always had a rocky relationship that stemmed from a time before she was even born thomas questioned the faithfulness of his wife in the frequent suggestions that giselle may not be his biological daughter this was an obstacle that was battled through from giselle’s birth up until her father’s deathand even after the relationship between the girls and their mother however seems to be solid giselle acknowledges that when she was her sister’s age approximately 14 one of her primary focuses was to discover ways to “be smaller” it is presumed that giselle and the entire vasco family for that matter were a religious group at one point giselle asks for god’s forgiveness after lying to her mother about her weight at the time giselle also acknowledges that she would masturbate in upwards of six times a day and would drink only lemon water in lieu of her desire to “be smaller” vesla would frequently take giselle to see the doctor regarding her weight often against her wishes there is no mention of a history of drug or alcohol use by giselle description of the problem as mentioned earlier while in high school giselle’s mother would constantly bring her to the doctor to check up on her weight giselle would do things like put rocks or weights in her pockets to tip the scale at 120 pounds as opposed to the 95 that she weighed her lack of a proper diet surrounds her potential diagnoses holly describes her sister’s systematical approach to the dinner table as giselle would figure out ways to clear her plate without digesting a single bite of food ie dropping food on the floor pretending to use the restroom and flushing portions of her meal aside from a lack of food toward her diet giselle would only drink lemon water sexually giselle is not what you would call repressed she became very sexually ambiguous after the departure of her first love also as discussed earlier giselle would spend much of her time locked in her room masturbating up to six times per day on a relational level giselle and her father always struggled with the speculation the she may not be his biological daughter we go on to discover that this is indeed true this made it hard for them to ever truly salvage a meaningful fatherdaughter relationship diagnosis in my personal opinion giselle’s diagnosis would be as follows axis i anorexia nervosa binge eatingpurging type 3071 and axis iv problems with primary support group criteria needing to be met for above axis i diagnosis as follows from dsm ivtr a refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height eg weight loss leading to maintenance of body weight less than 85 of that expected or failure to make expected weight gain during period of growth leading to body weight less than 85 of that expected over the course of years giselle would consume an insufficient diet consisting of little or no food and lemon water putting her at a weight that was below 85 percent than expected for her height she constantly resists the cautions of her mother and doctor in regard to her weight b intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat even though underweight giselle exhibits this behavior in her everyday way of thinking even though she is of above average height she intensely pursues a body weight that is unhealthy for her to maintain also she takes extreme measures to ensure that her body weight stays exceedingly low and in turn dangerous to her general wellbeing c disturbance in the way in which ones body weight or shape is experienced undue influence of body weight or shape on selfevaluation or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight although she is what is considered underweight giselle is indifferent to this fact and yearns to continue to lose dangerous amounts of weight she evaluates herself as being “too big” but seems to have a partial awareness that she is illshe may not be in denial d in postmenarcheal females amenorrhea ie the absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles a woman is considered to have amenorrhea if her periods occur only following hormone eg estrogen administration  symptoms of this nature were not discussed however details about her sexual history and excessive masturbation are mentioned accuracy of portrayal although it may not be glaringly clear should the average person read this book they would find a fairly accurate portrayal of the onset and manifestation of the eating disorder anorexia nervosa i say that it may not be clear in large part due to the fact that this work is narrated by two individuals both sisters as almost two different stories not only is giselle’s case of anorexia a prevalent point in the novel but so is the poor relationship between giselle and her father as well as the family dynamic after their father’s death there were however some very accurate descriptions of what behaviors would be exhibited from an individual with this disorder her constant dilemma on how to trick those around her into believing she was eating a healthy diet is quite common in individuals with anorexia giselle also references her constant hunger although she denies it to those around her her cold and clammy hands as well as constant fatigue are also associated features of anorexia that allude to her problem with that being said i feel that the book does an exceptional job of portraying an individual with anorexia nervosa treatment in treating giselle for her disorder the treatment team would focus their attention around two main goals 1 to help giselle gain weight and 2 to address giselle’s psychological and environmental issues a major step in treatment as in the treatment of any disorder would be to make sure that giselle is aware that she has a problem the most widely used form of treatment for this disorder is family and group therapy which cannot be utilized to its full potential should the patient not admit that heshe needs help in giselle’s case her sister and mother would play a very significant role in treatment as a clinician you would like to see giselle’s family encouraging her on a regular basis reinforcing the fact that she looks fine the way she is while eating a normal diet and that it is not necessary for her to exhibit these unhealthy behaviors more specifically i believe that giselle’s sister holly should be utilized as best as possible during treatment as they have always had a very strong bond and friendship if anyone would be able to aid in “breaking through” to giselle about her disorder i think it would be her little sister selfhelp groups are also successful in the treatment of those with anorexia treatment for giselle should include regular group meetings with individuals who have experienced the same negative outcomes in their lives due to the disorder the thought here is that by discussing the topic of anorexia among those who have it giselle will be afforded the opportunity to become more educated on the subject and eventually put herself in a position where she is aware of the harm she is causing her body over time between family therapy and selfhelp group therapy hopefully a certain sense of cognizance will begin to develop with giselle in regard to the harm she is causing herselfthis will hopefully lead to a change in attitude and eventually behavior alcohol abuse name lila blewitt source lila an inquiry into morals by robert m pirsig book background

avolition lila displayed all of these characteristics throughout the book b for a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance one or more major areas of functioning such as work interpersonal relations or selfcare are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset lila was unable to hold down a job drifting through life without goals or direction her interpersonal relationships suffered drastically everywhere that she went people would end up wanting to get and stay away from her lila was unable to maintain stability in her life with no home or occupation she had to rely on others to take care of her c continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months this 6month period mustinclude at least 1 month of symptoms that meet criterion a and may include periods of prodromalor residual symptoms the author indicated from conversations with a childhood friend of lila’s that she had suffered from the above stated symptoms throughout her adult life d schizoaffective disorder and mood disorder with psychotic features have been ruled outbecause either 1 no major depressive manic or mixed episodes have occurred concurrentlywith the activephase symptoms or 2 if mood episodes have occurred during activephasesymptoms their total duration has been brief relative to the duration of the active and residualperiods lila did not seem to display symptoms of mood disorders other than during a psychotic episode lila’s mood remained relatively stable throughout the book she did not display depression but she did display catatonia any time that she displayed anxiety it would be involving a break from reality e the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition lila’s substance abuse involved heavy drinking but her above symptoms were never consequences of being under the influence of alcohol at that time f if there is a history of autistic disorder or another pervasive developmental disorder theadditional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations arealso present for at least a month there is no history of either of the above listed disorders present in lila to fit the diagnostic criteria for 29510 disorganized type the following criteria are met a disorganized speech the author would describe the way lila conversated as being “word salad” it would make sense to lila but not to the listener b disorganized behavior lila got lost in new york city because she was not paying attention to the direction that she was walking in nor the direction that she would need to later return she also thought that it would be acceptable to take her clothes off in order to get somebody to “see” her she often needs others to rescue her from situations that she got herself into c flat and inappropriate affect during a psychotic episode lila’s affect became completely flat she would not speak or respond to any outside stimulus for an entire day to fit the diagnosis for alcohol abuse 30500a recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous and continued use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance lila would drink to the point of being intoxicated in public places where she did not know anybody when she did not have the money to pay for the drinks and did not even know her own whereabouts as a result of her behavior while intoxicated lila would behave inappropriately and aggressively towards others these behaviors would cause lila to be an outcast in her social circle b the symptoms have never met the criteria for substance dependence for this class of substance lila does not meet the criteria for substance dependence although drinking alcohol did cause lila the above stated problems lila did not drink as frequently as is required to be considered dependent accuracy of portrayal the average person reading this book would see an accurate portrayal of a person whose behavior qualifies for alcohol abuse the author does not make lila out to be dependent on alcohol but he does show how lila overconsumes alcohol to the point of causing her problems in her social life as well as putting herself in hazardous situations the comorbidity of her alcohol abuse with her schizophrenia is also an accurate portrayal for someone with less severe schizophrenia occurring in episodes rather than ongoing the book also illustrates for the reader accurately what may be going on inside the mind of a person during a schizophrenic episode as well as while abusing alcohol treatment to treat lila’s alcohol abuse the first step would be to provide treatment for her schizophrenia no long term success for treatment of her alcohol abuse could occur while lila was suffering from a psychotic disorder without treatment once lila was in treatment for schizophrenia you would then address her alcohol abuse lila would have to realize and admit that she was abusing alcohol the fact that alcohol abuse was causing social problems for lila as well as putting herself in dangerous situations could be presented to lila so that she would correlate alcohol abuse with its negative consequences while her treatment for schizophrenia could involve medication it would be important to look at possible drug interactions before prescribing her any medication to help her stop drinking next lila could start cognitive behavioral therapy to explore her emotional reaction to events in her life and her ensuing behaviors and their further consequences while emphasizing alcohol abuse throughout this process last lila could attend alcoholics anonymous to learn more about alcohol abuse and to have a social environment that is supportive of her while she is learning to change her behaviors involving alcohol abuse panic disorder without agoraphobia name tony soprano source the sopranos television series 19992005 background information tony was born of italian descent on august 24 1960 and is male at time of symptoms tony was 39 years of age tony soprano declares himself to be in the “waste management” business but is actually involved in criminal activity the tony is the capo in the dilteo crime family the duties included with this occupation are collecting “loans” and “persuading” people to pay back money that was “loaned” to them these “persuasions” include physical attacks as well as other forms of violence tony has the added responsibility to attempt to keep peace between him and other members of the organization tony is in relatively good health for a man his age but is noticeably overweight tony’s family mental health is very stressful tony has stressful relationships with his wife and work associates an especially stressful and dysfunctional relationship with the mother is also present tony has a history of alcohol and tobacco use major life difficulties include stress from work and problems from aging mother tony displays poor coping skills often resorting to anger and aggression the use of alcohol and promiscuous relationships are used as escaping behaviors description of the problem tony has had several episodes of fainting the first paint attack was described by tony as a feeling of “ginger ale in the skull” the symptoms tony experiences during his panic attack episodes include “racing” heart feeling faint and dizzy chest pains and breathing difficulties specific problems these symptoms are causing are increased difficulty dealing with demands from his occupation increased stress with family responsibilities especially issues involving the future of the tony’s aging mother tony is hesitant to admit he is experiencing depression but ultimately does state that he is depressed tony became deeply saddened by the departure of ducks he had been caring for he came to the realization the departure of the ducks symbolized his fear of losing control of his family job and life in general diagnosis diagnosis for the tony meets criteria for panic disorder without agoraphobia dsm4 tr code 30001 tony has recurrent unexpected panic attacks and shows worry about the implications of the attack eg losing control the tony does not display characteristics of agoraphobia the panic attacks do not appear to be due to the tony’s use of alcohol tobacco or any other preexisting physical conditions accuracy of portrayal the average person watching the portrayal of the tony would think that panic disorder is only caused by extreme life stress and that the disorder has minimal impact on other aspects of life functioning the main point for accuracy of portrayal included with this character is he also displays major depressive disorder this lends to the accuracy of portrayal due to the high comorbidity between panic disorder and major depressive disorder which is between ten to 65 percent also accuracy of the portrayal comes from the recurrent and unexpected nature of the panic attacks the inaccuracies from the portrayal include the presentation that panic attacks are only associated with highly stressful life events other inaccuracies are the lack of behavioral change and lack of impact on tony’s relationships and social life treatment the primary source of treatment would be cognitive behavioral therapy cbt would focus on having tony face behaviors and thinking patterns that sustain or trigger the panic attacks this treatment would have tony realistically ask themselves such questions as “what is the worst thing that could happen” for tony questions might include “what is the worst that could happen to my business or family if something were to happen to me” when tony is forced to look at the worst outcome and realize that everything would go on if this outcome happened he learns the source of his panic is less terrifying cognitive behavioral therapy might also be supplemented with antidepressant medicationdue to his cooccuring depressive symptoms the treatment that is displayed on the show for tony is a psychoanalytic approach the american psychiatric association does not acknowledge the role of intensive psychoanalytic therapies including psychoanalysis in the treatment of panic disorders however studies have shown significantly reduced panic symptoms from panic focused psychodynamic psychotherapy barbara et al 2007 more evidence must be gathered before the treatment presented in the show is recognized as a significant treatment for panic disorder panic disorder with agoraphobia name dr helen hudson source copycat movie 1995background information dr helen hudson is a retired criminal psychologist her exact age is not given but she is estimated to be in her mid 40’s she is a physically healthy female without a family of her own no family background is provided in the film dr hudson is very renowned in her field and often lectures on the subject she testifies against and profiles serial killers dr hudson was attacked by a killer she testified against and witnessed him kill one of her police bodyguards after he was sentenced to jail he threatened to kill her this triggered a deep fear and extensive amount of anxiety in dr hudson due to her fear and anxiety dr hudson confines herself to her home and puts in premium security systems to attempt to feel safe because dr hudson does not leave her home her social relationships are confined to her livein assistant and anonymous online friends she communicates with through chat rooms and games she is a heavy drinker and takes many pills for her condition upon becoming homebound dr hudson retired from clinical practice and writes books to generate an income description of the problem dr hudson was extremely traumatized by her attack and the violence and death she witnessed after the attack dr hudson not only retired from her practice but also became totally homebound to avoid contact with anyone who might be a potential serial killer she feels she is “the pinup girl” for serial killers she believes they all know her and want to either impress her with their killings or want to kill her dr hudson displays perceptions of imminent danger in even simple tasks such as retrieving the newspaper from the hallway in front of her apartment door when she does attempt to leave the apartment even in the face of another attack it brings on such severe panic that she almost becomes unconscious and returns to her home even though there is an intruder inside she has nightmares paranoia hyperventilates becomes dizzy breaks out in sweat and sometimes will pass out from her panic symptoms she occasionally hallucinates that she is seeing her attacker her panic attacks happen often enough that she keeps antianxiety medications in several places in her house for easy access she has a livein assistant to aid her in case she passes out during her attacks because of her alcohol and pill use she does not trust her own thoughts or actions from time to time she is often agitated in severe stress situations dr hudson will sometimes laugh inappropriately dr hudson does not verbally discuss the symptoms she is feeling but she does obviously sweat during her attacks and blurred vision is implied with camera use in the film she has a deep distrust of others and views herself as superior to others much of the time especially police officers diagnosis the diagnosis for dr helen hudson would be panic disorder with agoraphobia 30021 and is comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder 30981 dsm –ivtr criteria both 1 and 2 recurrent unexpected panic attacks at least one of the attacks has been followed by one month or more or one or more of the following a persistent concern about having additional attacks b worry about the implications of the attack or its consequences eg losing control having a heart attack “going crazy”c a significant change in behavior related to the attacks dr hudson does have recurrent unexpected attacks and has shown a drastic change in behavior the presence of agoraphobia dr hudson does not leave her home the panic attacks are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication  or a general medical condition eg hyperthyroidismalthough dr hudson drinks heavily her panic is not brought on by alcohol instead it is a coping mechanism that she uses to numb her thoughts or “kick in” her medications the panic attacks are not better accounted for by another mental disorder such as social phobia eg occurring on exposure to a feared social situation specific phobia eg on exposure to specific phobic situation obsessivecompulsive disorder eg on exposure to dirt in someone with an obsession about contamination posttraumatic stress disorder eg in response to stimuli associated with a severe stressor or separation anxiety disorder eg in response to being away from home or close relatives dr hudson does display the symptoms of ptsd it is comorbid to her panic and anxiety she experienced a lifethreatening situation and has recurrent thoughts and dreams about the experience accuracy of portrayal the people viewing this film would get a very accurate portrayal of panic disorder with agoraphobia along with posttraumatic stress disorder dr hudson displays many of the symptoms of all three conditions her condition is discussed in the film so it would give the general public the appropriate labels for both panic attacks and agoraphobia however ptsd is not discussed and seems to be the root of her problems it is hard to feel completely confident in this diagnosis without a discussion with the characterauthor many of the symptoms one would feel in a panic disorder need to be verbally expressed is she feeling the symptoms of a heart attack is she nauseous does she feel like she is choking do all of her thoughts stem back to her attack only the physical symptoms are apparent to the viewer the agoraphobia is well displayed in the film she very obviously suffers with the feeling she will be in a situation that will not allow her to escape and will suffer as she did when she was attacked by a killer posttraumatic stress disorder is comorbid in this diagnosis dr hudson’s symptoms were brought on by a horrific lifethreatening event she does have continued thoughts about this situation along with sleep disturbances from the attack treatment dr helen hudson would probably be very difficult to treat since she is a psychologist and would have been trained in and practiced treatments for her disorder by taking an antidepressant medication she could hopefully reduce her agoraphobic symptoms and with a benzodiazepine she could control her panic attacks however beginning other therapies would a healthier way for her to overcome her issues hopefully the medications would not need to be a longterm solution teaching dr hudson some relaxation techniques would help her avoid the thought processes that lead to her panic and agoraphobic symptoms practicing and using diaphragmatic breathing and positive meditation when panic symptoms present themselves would be a good coping skill for her keeping a thought record to help her recognize what situations or thought processes bring about her attacks would also be helpful recognition of detrimental thought processes and the relaxation techniques might help to reduce her panic symptoms and possibly help her avoid them altogether discussing the statistical data of people killed by serial killers would be a starting point in cognitive therapy for dr hudson she probably has a higher than chance probability of being targeted because she is a famous criminal psychologist and killers might try to impress her by outwitting her but generally speaking the chance of being killed by a serial killer is low next having dr hudson go through some lowlevel fear exposures would be necessary this would include viewing photos of serial killers and viewing documentaries about them next developing and rehearsing coping responses could be done here intense imagery would be used to help dr hudson imagine her darkest fears and increase her anxiety so that realistic solutions to her fears could be developed in this case possibly watching films of people being attacked fictionally and what they could have done to prevent or escape the attack to begin dealing with her agoraphobia baby steps could be taken to get here to a place where she feels comfortable leaving the home first might be opening the door to her apartment and just standing in the doorway second walking out of the door and standing in the hallway third standing in the hall with the door to the apartment closed these steps would continue hopefully to the point where she might even return to the convention hall in which she was attacked ending dr hudson’s reliance on alcohol would also have to be dealt with in her therapy she uses this as a numbing agent or as a kicker to her antianxiety drugs in confronting her issues it would be assumed she could become less reliant on these substances and live a much more normal life obsessivecompulsive disorder character name adrian monk source monk television series 20022009background information adrian is a 51 year old widowed male with no children adrian shows no signs of physical ailments or other health problems he does not have a history of drug or alcohol abuse he presently works for the san francisco police department as a consultant in homicide cases adrian obsesses over high levels of order and neatness and therefore has trouble functioning in the outside world he also selfreports an extensive list of phobias these symptoms were evident in childhood but seem to have been exacerbated by the death of his wife his goals are to extinguish the many phobias he suffers from and to experience some level of happiness adrian’s social circle consists of a few coworkers who are familiar with his condition according to adrian his parents were highly strict and very overprotective when he was a child adrian’s mother has been deceased since 1994 his father abandoned the family when adrian was 8 years old and they have only recently begun communicating again mental history of the father and mother are unknown adrian’s brother ambrose suffers from agoraphobia ambrose has little social contact and fears leaving his home relationships with both his father and brother are strained but otherwise healthy no other family mental illness is known though not a family member an important person in adrian’s life is his assistant this person assists adrian in his professional life as well as his personal life adrian has had two consecutive assistants that have filled this role for him this assistant is aware of adrian’s many phobias and does her best to help him avoid stressful situations for example she is responsible for always having antibacterial hand wipes available to “protect” adrian from the germs he fears description of the problem the greatest catalyst of monk’s behaviors seems to be the tragic death of his wife trudy who was murdered in a car bombing adrian was previously employed by the sfpd as a homicide detective but received a psychiatric discharge after the murder of his wife following his wife’s death adrian retreated to his home and refused to leave for three years with the help of his nurseassistant he has reluctantly entered out into the world again but still suffers from extreme obsessions compulsions and fears adrian has been unable to solve his wife’s homicide and this causes great emotional distress to him he often revisits and obsesses over the case adrian selfreports that he has 312 phobias and continues to accumulate more as time goes on these phobias range from common fears such as heights or germs to unordinary fears such as milk or mushrooms adrian also suffers from phobias of dentists sharp objects vomiting ladybugs glaciers death snakes crowds fear and small spaces these fears prohibit him from completing everyday tasks such as driving shopping and social interaction adrian’s work as a consultant for the sfpd requires him to visit crime scenes and evaluate evidence his photographic memory is especially helpful in his line of work however his anxiety often prevents him from being able to use his talents for example he arrived at a crime scene that had a burnt out bulb in a chandelier and was unable to work until the bulb had been changed in another instance he was unable to work because a police officer’s zipper was undone adrian is very intent on every aspect of his life being orderly neat and clean he has a habit of cleaning household cleaning appliances such as vacuums balance and symmetry are also important while working undercover at a bank he added his own money to every deposit so that the amounts would be whole dollars he also declined to see a therapist with an amputated arm because he could not get over the asymmetry adrian keeps a meticulous home with everything in order at all times he is obsessed with cleaning and cleaning products he has established certain menus and ways of eating that he also finds organized and acceptable for example he will only drink a certain kind of water and cuts his pancakes into squares because he prefers the symmetry if travel is absolutely necessary he goes to extreme lengths to pack everything must be kept in sealed plastic bags and he will often pack brand new individually wrapped bedding so he does not have to use something that someone else has used diagnosis the main diagnosis for mr monk appears to be obsessive compulsive disorder 3003 this disorder is classified in the anxiety disorders dms criteria require that either obsessions or compulsions must be present in order to qualify for the disorder both do not have to be present adrian appears to have both obsessions and compulsions to qualify for this disorder the client must exhibit uncontrolled concern about specific ideas and feel compelled to repeat particular acts of series of acts adrian’s concern over harmless objects such as milk and his compulsion to touch things such as poles makes him a candidate for obsessive compulsive disorder other dsm criteria include1 the person has recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable2 if another axis i disorder is present the content of the obsessions or compulsions is not restricted to it3 the obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress are time consuming take more than 1 hour a day or significantly interfere with the person’s normal routine occupational or academic functioning or usual social activities or relationships4 the disturbance s not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or general medical condition adrian fits this criterion as well he is intelligent and sees that his behaviors are unreasonable but is comforted by them anyway his grooming and cleaning habits often take excessive amounts of time and go beyond what would reasonably be considered clean he has no other known physical or mental problems that would cause his behavior there is no history of substance abuse associated features of ocd that are present in adrian’s behavior are avoidance of situations where the objects of obsessions are present frequent doctor visits and feelings of guiltresponsibility adrian also exhibits the associated features of compulsive acts in order to alleviate anxiety excessive cleansing or grooming practices and extreme need for symmetrical aligning of objects accuracy of portrayal i think the portrayal of adrian monk is an accurate description of obsessive compulsive disorder someone watching this series would be able to learn about the irrational fears and the difficulties that adrian has in overcoming them despite how irrational they are they would be able to see how his behaviors prohibit him from functioning at an optimal level another positive aspect of the show is that it shows adrian as someone with a mental illness but he is not vilified or seen as inferior i think this helps promote the idea that having mental illness is not shameful one possible problem with the show is how his behaviors are usually seen as quirky but still fu ional for someone suffering from ocd in real life the consequences can be much more detrimental and debilitating also although he is presented as a gloomy character real ocd can lead to severe depression in the affected individual also he seems to have more phobias than compulsions aside from touching poles he does not exhibit the repetitive behaviors associated with ocd treatment treatment for adrian could include a prescription for an ssri medication in order to increase his serotonin production this could aid in the reduction of depression symptoms anxiety symptoms and obsessivecompulsive symptoms in addition to medication intense behavioral therapy specifically exposure therapy with response prevention is also recommended this would involve exposing adrian to the things he fears most whenever practical and ethical and compelling him to experience his anxiety until it comes down to a bearable or normal level in adrian’s case however this would be very timeconsuming due to the number of phobias he possesses due to adrian’s difficulty in establishing interpersonal relationships following his wife’s death grief counseling may also be indicated also his assistant could be included in much of the therapy so that she could be reinforcing appropriate behaviors in his daily life bipolar ii disorder name casey roberts source mad love movie 1995 background information casey roberts is a female high school student in her late teens upon arriving at a new high school she appears to be fairly normal in behavior however it is apparent from early on that she has almost no social relationships or even more a desire to have any aside from a relationship with her parents who appear supportive and loving she only has one other relationship which consumes her throughout the movie her relationship with her boyfriend matt this relationship is what drives many of her actions throughout the movie her parents say there is no past mental health history in their families however they are in denial of her having an actual mental illness and attribute it to her trying to get back at them for controlling her so the real history may not be reported no major drug or alcohol use is apparent although casual drinking is seen throughout the movie and nicotine use especially while in her depressed episode is also shown there are no outward health problems visible in casey she is a very intelligent girl with a very strong willed personality however she does not seem to care too much about asserting that intelligence towards any goals school is in no way important to her description of the problem although casey is at some points able of living and functioning normally she has a past of suicidal behavior as stated in the background information she has little to no social relationships however she does appear to be a fairly friendly person probably the largest hindrance on her functioning is her impulsivity she seems to think that she should do and be able to do whatever she wants when she pleases towards the end she also has a tendency towards thoughts that are very sporadic in nature casey displays much risk taking behavior without seeing any important consequences that could occur from them she is also temperamental and very easy to irritate delinquent behavior is also presented in her behaviors in the form of truancy and the case of her pulling a fire alarm in the school she also has very strong thoughts of guilt and states that as punishment for the things she has done to matt he should leave her when the onset of her illness begins to be very apparent she shows much distractibility and tends to not behave correctly in social situations insomnia also is presented along with strange ideas these ideas could possibly also be symptoms of schizophrenia such as thinking people are always watching her and out to get her she believes that she must put cut outs of eyes up around their apartment to protect them diagnosis the diagnosis for casey is bipolar ii disorder 29689 to reach that diagnosis the following must be true a presence or history of one or more major depressive episodes within the movie there is a major depressive episode her parents also referred back to the fact that casey had experienced episodes before as well b presence or history of at least one hypomanic episode a hypomanic episode was also included in the movie evidence on whether or not she had been through more than one episode of this before was not provided c there has never been a manic episode or a mixed episode casey’s symptoms were not severe enough to classify as a manic or mixed episode d the mood symptoms in criteria a and b are not better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and are not superimposed on schizophrenia schizophreniform disorder delusional disorder or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified although casey had some odd behaviors that seemed almost similar to ones that would be presented in schizophrenia or a very similar disorder they would not be classified as actual delusions the inconsistencies in her behaviors seem to classify more into bipolar disorder e the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning casey’s ability to form relationships was greatly affected by her symptoms also distress was definitely seen within social situations casey was found in a bathroom with her dress off and hitting the walls and crying a diagnosis of a major depressive episode was found by the following a must include five or more of the following over a 2week period1 depressed mood most of the day nearly every day as indicated by either subjective report eg feels sad or empty or observation made by others eg appears tearful note in children and adolescents can be irritable mood2 markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities most of the day nearly every day as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others3 significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain eg a change of more than 5 of body weight in a month or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day note in children consider failure to make expected weight gains4 insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5 psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day observable by others not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down6 fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7 feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt which may be delusional nearly every day not merely selfreproach or guilt about being sick8 diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly every day either by subjective account or as observed by others9 recurrent thoughts of death not just fear of dying recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide casey presented symptoms 1 4 7 and 9 b the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode her symptoms were not presented as both manic and depressive on a nearly daily basis c the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning distress and impairment were definitely apparent in social situations the example of the bathroom scene previously mentioned demonstrated this d the symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition eg hypothyroidism no drugs were being used besides nicotine and no other stated medical condition was present f the symptoms are not better accounted for by bereavement id after the loss of a loved one the symptoms persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment morbid preoccupation with worthlessness suicidal ideation psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation no loved ones were lost the symptoms had been reported for over 2 months and she had attempted suicide numerous times a diagnosis of a hypomanic episode was found according to the following a a distinct period of persistently elevated expansive or irritable mood lasting throughout at least 4 days that is clearly different from the usual nondepressed mood it is characterized as a period of increased energy that is not sufficient or severe enough to qualify as a manic episode casey’s mood was elevated while they were traveling and she was in her hypomanic episode the severity of it would not classify as a manic episode however b during the period of mood disturbance three or more of the following symptoms have persisted four if the mood is only irritable and have been present to a significant degree1 inflated selfesteem or grandiosity2 decreased need for sleep eg feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep3 more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking4 flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing5 distractibility ie attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli6 increase in goaldirected activity either socially at work or school or sexually or psychomotor agitation7 excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences eg engaging in unrestrained buying sprees sexual indiscretions or foolish business investmentscasey presents symptoms 2 3 5 and 7 within her hypomanic episode c the episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the person when not symptomatic she seemed to function almost normally when the episode was not happening when she started presenting symptoms her level of functioning obviously decreased d the disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others like previously stated her changes were observable g the episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization and there are no psychotic features her hypomanic episode did not strike matt as “scary” or needing help immediately like her depressive episode no hospitalization was seen as necessary h the symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication or other treatment or a general medical condition eg hyperthyroidism no drugs were being used besides nicotine and no other stated medical condition was present accuracy of portrayal watching the portrayal of casey would give a person a fairly good look into bipolar disorder most people label someone as “bipolar” when really they are just having mood swings or maybe suffering from cyclothymic disorder this idea of such rapid switching is not accurate although casey did have her moments of sudden anger or happiness that can be accounted for by simply an experience she had or something that was said simple reactions like this are very common however her episodes as portrayed were seen as changing over periods of time not just in an instant giving the watchers a pretty good insight on the disorder in the film casey’s mother stated that casey suffered from depression this may have influenced watchers to disregard her hypomanic symptoms overall the audience would get a fairly good look into the actual life of a person with bipolar disorder treatment when casey arrived for treatment a medical work up would occur to make sure the disorder was accurately diagnosed this would also allow knowledge of the current episode suicidal thoughts and hopefully more family history casey would probably then be prescribed lithium carbonate because of the potency of this drug her dosage would need to be very closely monitored therapy would also be a very useful tool for casey’s treatment cognitive behavioral therapy would be a good start to help her deal with her emotions and stress therapy would also help casey to fully understand bipolar disorder and to know in the future when an episode may happen likewise education would be essential for her parents helping them understand what exactly is happening with casey and to recognize her episodes would be very beneficial oppositional defiant disorder name stewie griffin source family guy television series 1999 – present background information stewie griffin is a caucasian male who is presumed to be one years old although he may be four to five years old because in later episodes he attends preschool stewie is unemployed but shows a mastery level of physics and mechanical engineering he has designed such things as mind control devices weather control fighter jets and teleportation devices although there are not any known distinct physical illnesses abnormalities or disorders currently within stewie griffin there are observable health concerns the patient displays unprovoked hostility towards others constant disobeying of parental rules is extremely vengeful and vindictive and easily loses his temper quite frequently stewie currently lives with his parents peter and lois griffin stewie’s father peter griffin shows observable symptoms of mild mental retardation this is evident when he took an iq test in one of the episodes and scored a 70 it is also observed that stewie’s parents exhibit a strong sense of control over his life such as scheduling play dates for him to go on toys he cancan not play with and whatwhen he can eat stewie exhibits strong introversion in social relationships he does not have close relationships with anyone outside of his immediate family this is due to the fact that stewie sees his peers as obstacles in his path toward world domination because of this he frequently kills off the lesser characters with tanks guns and other assorted weaponry there have not been patterns of consistent alcohol usage by stewie but he has excessively used alcohol on occasion this is particularly problematic as any type of alcohol usage by a one year old can severely inhibit brain development stewie’s goal is to attain world domination by first killing his mother who he fears will stand in his way all of stewie’s daily activities are designed to accomplish these two goals by creating weapons such as rocket launchers engaging in violent criminal activities carjacking loan sharking and forgery other weaknesses that stewie displays are his stresses of infant life such as teething and eating his vegetables description of the problem stewie griffin currently displays a multitude of symptoms indicative of oppositional defiant disorder he displays disobedient actions towards authority figures however stewie believes that he is conducting himself in an appropriate manner for his own selfpreservation he also suffers from delusional behaviors such as having conversations with his stuffed teddy bear rupert he protects rupert and will avenge any harm that comes rupert’s way stewie deliberately annoys his peers by picking on them and continuously making rude remarks about their appearance or inabilities as a person he also shows anger and resentfulness towards his mother because he feels that he is wrongly punished for activities he is supposed to carry out for the betterment of himself and world domination as a result of this he is also very spiteful and vindictive for example in one episodes stewie loans brian some money and they contractually agree that payment would be made on a certain date but brian does not repay on that date so stewie beats brian with a bat daily until he receives payment stewie often uses a scapegoat for his own mistakes when his attempts to kill his mother fail he blames her for being unfair and bitchy diagnosis the diagnosis for stewie griffin that fits appropriately is oppositional defiant disorder 31381 a to be diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder a pattern of negativism hostile and defiant behavior lasting at least 6 months during which four or more of the following are present1 often loses temper2 often argues with adults3 often actively defies complying with adults’ requestsrules4 often deliberately annoys people5 often blames others for his or her mistakes6 is often easily annoyed by others7 is often angry and resentful8 is often spiteful or vindictive stewie griffin undoubtedly shows more than four symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder as described in the section “description of the problem” b consider a criterion met only if the behavior occurs more frequently than is typically observed in individuals of comparable age and developmental level stewie possesses the ability to talk fluently at age one and interact with people at an intimate social level that is not yet observable in the one year old population typical one year olds rely heavily on parental care where stewie is significantly more independent than his peers eg taking trips to san francisco and rhode island c the disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social academic or occupational functioning stewie is significantly impaired in social functioning because he does not develop and nurture his relationships instead he sees his peers as obstacles towards his goal that he must defeat at all costs because of this he does not have any significant social relationship with anyone outside his immediate family d the behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic or mood disorder characteristics of oppositional defiant disorder can be observed in the patient in all settings and instances throughout his daily activities e if the individual is age 18 years or older criteria are not met for antisocial personality disorder the patient is between the ages of 14 years old f there is a recurrent pattern of negativistic defiant disobedient and hostile behavior towards authority figures stewie is in constant confliction with how he is going to succeed in killing his mother and attaining world domination g occurs outside of normal developmental levels and leads to impairment in functioning stewies behavior is clearly outside of normal development for a one year old and this leads to impairment in functioning such as developing strategies to kill his mother and take over the world eg making weapons with the purpose of carrying out these goals accuracy of portrayal the typical person watching family guy would be able to reach the conclusion that the character stewie griffin is abnormally developing compared to his average peer a person with an abnormal psychology background would be able to further determine that stewie showed all the symptoms for oppositional defiant disorder this is a cartoon character created to break the boundaries of normal development for babies even to represent the general helplessness of an infant through the eyes of an adult this show helps illustrate oppositional defiant disorder by successfully creating a character that exemplifies every characteristic of the disorder and not wavering from season to season although stewie is not an accurate portrayal of the average one year old he still can be related to children suffering from this disorder therefore stewie griffin is an accurate illustration of someone with oppositional defiant disorder treatment to treat stewie griffin after a full medical examination it would be best to teach him problemsolving skills as well as parent management training problem solving skills would help stewie learn to solve problems in a logical and predictable manner the downfall with this strategy is that is time consuming and on average requires 20 sessions another effective way to treat oppositional defiant disorder is parent management training this allows the parents to develop and implement structured management programs at home this is designed to improve interactions between child and parent parents implementing this strategy should positively reinforce good behaviors a secondary methodology of treating oppositional defiant disorder is to medicate the child using ritalin research has shown children treated with ritalin who have oppositional defiant disorder 75 of the children no longer showed symptoms of odd name walker bobby and texas ranger “tr” bobby source talladega nights the ballad of ricky bobby movie 2006 background information walker and texas ranger bobby are prepubescent males with an estimated age of 11 and 7 respectively neither boy holds a job because of their young age the bobby brothers do not display any specific health issues walker and texas ranger live with both of their parents and their maternal grandfather chip their father ricky is a famous racecar driver who displays some symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder claiming that he is “the best there is” and that he “piss es excellence” their mother carley does not show any observable symptoms of a mental disorder however she is very materialistic markedly aggressive when provoked and shows extreme devotion to her husband at least until the promise of better prospect comes along eg she leaves ricky for cal when ricky can no longer race in other words their mother is a golddigger the family unit is still very much intact – they eat dinner together every night and attend all of ricky’s races together while the bonds between the family are obviously very strong walker and texas ranger display many types of defiant and hostile behaviors toward authority figures most likely due to their lack of shock and surprise these behaviors are not typically directed towards their parents rather the bobby brothers act out to other close adults like both of their grandfathers chip and reese and their grandmother lucy in fact the boys’ mother and father seem to condone this behavior claiming that they did not raise “sissies” walker and texas ranger were never portrayed as having done illicit drugs although they did inquire about a comment that their grandfather reese had made about possessing marijuana besides the problems that they have run into at school due to behavioral issues the boys do not possess any real life difficulties they do not have any deeply defined goals either as they are just kids looking to enjoy themselves while they can due to their inconsistent and overindulgent lifestyle walker and texas ranger’s coping skills are not very good they handle lessthanperfect situations with immaturity and anger often lashing out at whoever they believe will take it their weaknesses are handling new unwanted situations such as sunday school and being polite to adults description of the problem walker and texas ranger currently display a multitude of symptoms indicative of oppositional defiant disorder they are consistently defiant and hostile spouting out at whomever they believe deserves the criticism or hatred these two display a constant need to argue and swear especially to adults they argue most often with their grandfathers chip and reese their grandmother lucy and their teachers in school there is nothing off limits for these boys their actions and criticisms are often unnecessary and cruel – usually just for the purpose of upsetting or annoying the adults around them diagnosis the diagnosis for the bobby brothers that fits most appropriately is oppositional defiant disorder 31381 to be diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder the following criteria must be met a pattern of negativism hostile and defiant behavior lasting at least 6 months during which four or more of the following are present often loses temper often argues with adults often actively defies or refuses to comply with adults’ requests or rules often deliberately annoys people often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior is often touchy or easily annoyed by others is often angry or resentful is often spiteful or vindictivenote – consider a criterion met only if the behavior occurs more frequently than is typically observed in individuals of comparable age and developmental level walker and texas ranger meet all criteria for oppositional defiant disorder except for number 5 blaming others for mistakes or misbehavior they constantly insulted and swore at adults threw chip’s war medals off of a bridge to make him mad argued with their teachers and purposefully peed their pants and refused to take them off just to prove a point these behaviors are more extreme than those of children at similar developmental levels where most children their age might only do these sorts of things once walker and texas ranger do them all of the time the disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social academic or occupational functioning the boys do not know how to function in a social setting repulsing most adults who come into contact with them the boys do not seem to care what other people think of them they say mean things causing adults to react negatively creating a viscious cycle of disobedience academic functioning although mentioned briefly is most likely effected texas ranger specifically flaunted his bad behavior in the classroom the behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic or mood disorder the characteristics previously described are displayed in many contexts over a lasting period of time they are not a result of a psychotic or mood disorder criteria are not met for conduct disorder and if the individual is age 18 years or older criteria are not met for antisocial personality disorder walker and texas ranger are approximately 11 and 7 years old respectively they did not physically aggress towards others and did not commit any serious crimes recurrent pattern of negativistic defiant disobedient and hostile behavior towards authority figures the symptoms are constant – they do not vary from day to day their disobedience is only in response to authority figures occurs outside of normal developmental levels and leads to impairment in functioning most children their ages do not insult swear and act out this much the quality of their interactions are severely inhibited and functioning is impaired accuracy of portrayal the average person watching these boys would immediately recognize that there is a significant problem walker and texas ranger are on the extreme side of disobedience most parents would probably be able to relate the problems of these characters to those of their own children only to a much lesser degree they would learn that oppositional defiant disorder is characterized by defiance hostility frequent outbursts of rage swearing and disobedience the portrayal of this disorder is very accurate – the boys’ behavior was consistent throughout the movie and did not waiver their depiction in particular was very extreme as their behavior was observed both at home and in school the inaccurate aspects of the boys’ portrayal would be their display of oppositional behaviors in unfamiliar territory their lack of temper tantrums or clear frustration with difficult situations and the ease and rapid pace of change in behavior once their grandmother decided it was time to start acting appropriately treatment in the movie walker and texas ranger’s grandmother lucy took things into her own hands she established what she called “granny law” and broke the boys like “wild horses” with community service yoga disposal of their weapons and church attendance as a mental health professional it would be best to first conduct a structured or semistructured clinical interview to explore fully the family’s history the symptoms that pertain to odd and the possible comorbid problems that can occur as a result of the disorder the first measure of treatment that should be implemented are problemsolving – skillstraining programs which involve teaching children how to solve problems in a logical and predictable manner the only setback of this training is that it is extremely timeconsuming requiring an average of twenty sessions another possible treatment is called parent management training this training teaches parents how to effectively implement contingency management programs at home allowing both parent and child to better enjoy their interactions by learning how to praise positive behaviors establishing schedules and sticking to them and maintaining effective timeouts this greatly increases awareness in the child as to what is expected of them as well as what will happen if they misbehave autistic disorder name arnie grape source what’s eating gilbert grape movie 1993 background information arnie grape is a caucasian male who is 17 years old and is close to turning 18 he does not go to school and spends most of his time with his older brother gilbert arnie appears to be mentally disabled or developmentally disabled when arnie was born the doctor said he would be lucky if he lived to the age of 10 and when he turned 10 the doctor said he could die at anytime he has repetitive speech which it seems as if he is listening but then turns around and does the same things over again he engages in very dangerous behaviors but is not aware of how dangerous his behaviors are for example he climbed up the water tower in the town and was dangling off the side of the ladder laughing the entire time not knowing how serious the situation was arnie lives with his mother brother and two sisters he is very close to his older brother because gilbert takes care of him his mother bonnie who has not left the house in seven years became morbidly obese and depressed when her husband committed suicide his two sisters amy and ellen take care of the chores and do all the cooking arnie is very friendly to other children in his town but it does not appear that he has very many friends because they do not understand his ways of communication although there were many children at his eighteenth birthday party there is an instance when arnie will not go into the basement because he said “dad is down there” and then he does a hanging motion arnie does not appear to take any medication or see a regular physician or psychologist his feelings are easily hurt because he does not fully understand what people are saying to him arnie does not appear to have any goals other than trying to survive description of the problem arnie kills a grasshopper by cutting its head off in the mailbox and a little while after he kills it he gets very upset at himself and is sad that the grasshopper died he has certain hand movements that he constantly does he puts his hand to his mouth a certain way when he is in an uncomfortable situation he has eye twitches and he blinks quite often arnie is always running off and hiding from gilbert or climbing the water tower gilbert knows where arnie is hiding but plays a game and pretends that he does not know arnie is up in the tree and he thinks gilbert has no idea where he is when other people get hurt or when arnie says mean things to others he thinks that it is very funny and usually laughs hysterically he is arrested for climbing the water tower and when they put him in the cop car all he is worried about is the cops turning on the lights and sirens he is not able to take care of himself for example gilbert puts arnie in the bath and tells him that he is a big boy and can wash himself gilbert leaves and comes back the next morning to find arnie still in the bathtub arnie repeats everything that people tell him to do and what they say in general after the bathtub incident arnie is afraid of any kind of body of water he gets very upset and starts to hurt himself when he tries to wake his mother and she never wakes up diagnosis the diagnosis for arnie grape that fits most appropriately is autistic disorder 29900 to be diagnosed with autism disorder criteria a b and c must be met a total of six or more items from 1 2 and 3 with at least two from 1 and one each from 2 and 3 1 qualitative impairment in social interaction as manifested by at least two of the following a marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eyetoeye gaze facial expression body postures and gestures to regulate social interaction b failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level c a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment interests or achievements with other people eg by a lack of showing bringing or pointing out objects of interest d lack of social or emotional reciprocity 2 qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following a delay in or total lack of the development of spoken language not accompanied by an

restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus b apparently inflexible adherence to specific nonfunctional routines or rituals c stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms eg hand or finger flapping or twisting or complex whole body movementsarnie meets the criteria for deficits for three out of the four in section one as described in the section of “description of the problem” arnie does not meet the criteria in c because he was always trying to talk to people and make friends with them arnie meets all the criteria for section two because he repeats every word a person says to him he is not able to carry on a conversation with anyone and he does not seem to have any imaginative friends he does not meet the criteria in section three listed under b because he does not have any specific rituals arnie meets the criteria for a and c because he was obsessed with taking care of a cricket and kept it in a jar and he constantly made the same hand movements when he felt uncomfortable in a situation b delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas with onset prior to age 3 years1 social interaction2 language as used in social communication3 symbolic or imaginative play arnie’s history was not given prior to age three but one could conclude that he had delays in all three areas prior to age three c the disturbance is not better accounted for by rett’s disorder or childhood disintegrative disorder arnie was born with his disorder and has had it his whole life the doctors did not expect him to live long but he did and everyone called him a miracle child accuracy of portrayal the average person watching this movie would probably think this individual is mentally disabled they would see that he needs a caretaker constantly that he is not able to communicate well with others and that he is unaware of the outside world around him these symptoms could be confused with mental retardation or a mental disability to be specifically diagnosed with autism all the criteria above have to be met arnie met all the criteria so if an individual was familiar with or educated on autism they would be able to see an accurate portrayal of autism this movie lets people see the different types of autism the types of autism that are usually shown in the media are children who are quiet reserved and do not talk to anyone but arnie was the complete opposite he was loud tried to speak to everyone and was not afraid of most things throughout the entire movie no one talked about arnie’s disorder nor did they label what he had been diagnosed with at birth what’s eating gilbert grape was an accurate portrayal of an individual with autism treatment first a full medical and psychological evaluation would be given to arnie arnie would need to be put in a stable setting currently he lives with his mother and siblings but his mother is unable to take care of him he needs an individual to take care of him full time and that individual needs to be specialized in how to take care of his needs he also needs an individual to work with him on his communication skills yes he is past the developmental stage of language but having that daily practice could help him greatly with his language skills arnie also needs behavioral treatment therapy so that he is able to understand how to act in certain situations he needs more support from his family everyone needs to be interactive in his treatment and give a helping hand name mandy amanda source fly away movie 2011 background information mandy is

gets her back down to a controllable level this is the only form of positive coping shown mandy’s weaknesses are her short temper and violent outbursts this makes it almost impossible for her to be

can range from cars and trains to numbers and letters inappropriately intense or odd in their content rigid adherence to routines or rituals repetitive motor mannerisms opening and closing doors

disorder or childhood disintegrative disorder there would be no difficulties in diagnosis for mandy as being autistic she meets criteria in a b and c pertaining to the previously stated problems mandy is clearly autistic accuracy of portrayal most people who watch the film would label mandy as having a mental disability the average person would not know the criterion that depicts autism mandy clearly can be labeled as autistic because she meets all of the above criteria most films that portray individuals with autism show them as quiet and socially distant this movie shows an individual with an extreme case of autism and does a very good job showing how hard it is to live with this disorder the movie did a good job showing the daily hassles for the family members and how it affects the individuals self esteem people watching this film got a truthful insight on the life of an individual with autism and would learn about the disorder through the film and mandy’s character fly away was an accurate portrayal of an individual with autism treatment first mandy would undergo a full medical and psychological evaluation she would need to be put in a stable environment and be able to express some sort of responsibility and self support mandy lives with her mom and has a good support system but at her age mandy needs to be able to do things on her own without some supervision and her mother is not trained properly to be able to provide that currently she lives with her mother she needs to have a specialized worker that can help her but not treat her like a child developing her self sufficient skills will help her be able to control more of her emotional responses and better understand social interactions she also needs an individual to work with her on her communication skills even though mandy is past the developmental stage of language but having that daily practice could help her greatly with her language skills mandy will also need behavioral treatment therapy so that she is able to understand how to act in certain situations and control her violent outbursts with behavioral therapy more developed communication skills family support and more accountability mandy will be able to better cope and function with her disorder dysthymic disorder name bill dauterive born gillaume fontaine de la tour dhaute rive source king of the hill television series 19972010 background information bill dauterive is a caucasian male around the age of 42 this age estimate is based on his friends including hank hill who has been stated to be 42 years old and that he was in the same school grade as his friends bill is from an upperclass family in louisiana around new orleans his family is not present very often and the only remaining relative he has is a male cousin his selfreports of childhood hardships caused by his father could be fictitious because there is no way to verify this he has almost no family so genetic factors are hard to account for his cousin is in good shape and healthy bill is the opposite he was told by a doctor that he would become diabetic if he did not change his lifestyle he was a high school athlete nicknamed the “billdozer” he was very popular had many friends and even held the school touchdown record he was drafted into the military his senior year of high school and never graduated he has remained in the army and is now a sergeant barber he is not particularly poor or wealthy he is a simple person and does not have any extravagant tastes or interests that he has reported he met his wife lenore at a concert she cheated on him and subsequently they divorced this is reportedly when the depressive symptoms began appearing he could not heal from the divorce and claims he still loves her he became overweight and started losing his hair his friends dale gribble jeff boomhauer and hank hill constantly comment on his depression and try to help him he has had this core group of friends from a young age they all live on the same street and get together in the alley to have a beer often bill is obsessed with hank’s wife and believes she is the perfect picture of a woman she is the complete opposite of bill’s exwife even though he has a core group of these 3 friends they often make fun of him and sometimes exclude him he has a very poor sense of hygiene and his house is often very dirty his friends and their wives often make remarks about this he is in a depressive state most of the time the only time he is out of a depressive state is when he is with a woman who always later rejects him or gets very involved in a project such as an instance where he turned his home into a halfway house he enjoyed the company and enjoyed being needed but the occupants took advantage of him and he missed so many days at work the army almost reported him absent without leave or awol he clings to women he gets into relationships with very quickly he will be overly dedicated to the women but they always end up taking advantage of him and ending the relationship he perceives relationships to be more serious than they are in reality this behavior inevitably drives them away description of the problem bill often states that he is depressed this depression has lasted since his divorce which is estimated to be 79 years ago he is in a depressed state most of the time others describe him as very depressed and down he has some periods of normality but usually he is just depressed he believes no one loves him or will love him and gets into relationships in which he is very likely to be rejected he overeats and does not take care of himself very well he has a very poor image of himself but does not seem to care enough to attempt to better himself he often speaks of his exwife and the divorce and of still loving her if he is not working he is at home eating and watching tv or in the alley having a beer with his friends he does not do much else his friends often remark on his bringing up of his divorce and try to set him up with women but the women usually reject him there have been a few relationships he has ended himself but the majority are not his choice his friends attempt to tell him he is too good for his exwife and that she is not coming back bill gets particularly depressed around the holidays he usually spends thanksgiving with hank hill’s family which is very intrusive to them he went through a period of suicidal actions and thoughts but never completed or repeated these behaviors his friends were constantly watching him diagnosis the disorder bill dauterive most accurately can be diagnosed as having is dysthymic disorder 3004 a depressed mood for most of the day for more days than not as indicated either by subjective account or observation by others for at least 2 years bill is selfdescribed as being depressed a lot of the time his friends also state that he is depressed all of the time and it has been going on for longer than 2 years in fact it is closer to 7 years b presence while depressed of two or more of the followingpoor appetite or overeatinginsomnia or hypersomnialow energy or fatiguelow selfesteempoor concentration or difficulty making decisionsfeelings of hopelessness bill experiences overeating low energy and fatigue low selfesteem and feelings of hopelessness occasionally he experiences insomnia and poor concentration quite often his despair will lead him to overeat which leads to further low selfesteem the symptoms seem to compound themselves bill’s friend hank is usually the one who makes a lot of bill’s decisions because he has difficulty doing so himself whether everyday decisions or more meaningful decisions c during the 2year period of the disturbance the person has never been without the symptoms in criteria a and b for more than 2 months at a time bill fits this and does not seem to reach the 2 month mark for absence of symptoms bill’s symptoms of depression seem to be chronic he is never out of his depressed state for longer than a few days and this is usually because he has found someone to be in a relationship with for a short time d no major depressive episode has been present during the first 2 years of the disturbance ie the disturbance is not better accounted for by chronic major depressive disorder or major depressive disorder in partial remission this is hard to account for because bill is being seen 7 years after the onset since it has lasted so long however dysthymic disorder accounts for it very well e there has never been a manic episode a mixed episode or a hypomanic episode and criteria have never been met for cyclothymic disorder there has been no evidence of a hypomanic episode the closest period would be when bill experiences some type of normalcy does not last very long he does not have manic episodes or even hypomanic episodes sometimes he is obsessive but that does not last very long and he slips back into depression no period of normalcy is seen he does not qualify for cyclothymic disorder because he does not have periods of hypomanic or manic symptoms f the disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or delusional disorder bill does not have symptoms of a psychotic disorder g the symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition eg hypothyroidism bill does not present with any substance abuse or other medical conditions before the onset of dysthymic disorder he was happy popular and content with his life he does drink a beer in the alley with his friends nearly everyday but it is usually just one beer if he is feeling extremely depressed he will drink to excess but this is a result of his depression not a cause h the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning this disorder impacts every portion of bill’s life he needs to be needed and when he is for short periods of time it makes him miss work he was almost listed as awol on more than one occasion in his social life his depression causes major impairment all his friends state that he is depressed all the time he does not take care of himself which leads to low selfesteem this majorly impacts his attempts at finding a date he does not make new friends and he only has the core group of friends he grew up with when he attempts to meet new people he is usually rejected and thus he does not try very often regarding etiology bill’s dysthymia seems to have been caused by his divorce so the psychosocial causal factor fits there is no way to determine if genetic factors are possible as his only living relative is a male cousin accuracy of portrayal an average person watching bill in king of the hill would get a very good idea for what dysthymic disorder is bill expresses almost all of the symptoms almost all of the time the portrayal is accurate in that bill exhibits almost all of the symptoms of dysthymic disorder nearly all the time saying that bill is depressed all of the time is not an exaggeration in people with major depressive disorder there are longer periods of normalcy but in dysthymic disorder there are not long periods of normalcy more often than not bill is depressed major depressive disorder is more about episodes of depression but dysthymic disorder is depression nearly all of the time and bill exhibits this the only inaccuracy was his period of suicidality but this was a cry for help not an actual wish of death it was not repeated treatment dysthymia has not been widely studied and this impacts research on treatment many findings from major depressive disorder have been applied to dysthymic disorder since it is often referred to as a milder form of major depressive disorder one could begin by treating bill with an antidepressant after the appropriate dosage was found he would begin psychotherapy bill needs to be taught about the disorder and recognize that he is not in a normal state of mind and begin to come out of it since he does not really have any family to speak of to attend therapy with him his friends should accompany him because they are the individuals he sees most often they could be shown that their comments to bill are hurtful and need to end if bill’s core group of friends were taught about dysthymic disorder they could learn ways to help bill when he was feeling down and make him feel better about himself and the situations he finds himself in a therapist could use cognitive therapy to help bill change how he sees the world and to think more optimistically this would show bill that not every bad thing that happens is a crisis and which events to just let go of he needs help getting over his divorce and gaining his selfesteem back other recommendations that he find a hobby he likes and recommend him to someone to help him with nutritional skills such as what to eat and what to cook name andrew largeman source garden state movie 2004 background information andrew is a 26 year old actor and waiter from new jersey he was living in los angeles when he got the news that his mother has passed away returning to new jersey for his mother’s funeral he has to face his psychiatrist father with whom he has no relationship when andrew was

first time has stopped taking the medication that has been prescribed to him after meeting a female friend andrew feels that he can relate to her and seems less depressed when he is with her however this is largely just taking his mind off his problems and his symptoms are still apparent gideon largeman is andrew’s father who is a psychiatrist after his wife’s accident involving andrew gideon tries to suppress a deep loathing towards his son he blames andrew for the accident that left his wife paralyzed to “curb the anger” that he holds towards his son he heavily medicates him starting at

die yet he still does not or cannot show any emotion he is just in a daze without care of what is going on in the world around him he has explained that he has not cried in many years it is apparent that he isolates himself from his family and friends diagnosis the appropriate disorder after evaluating andrew is dysthymia disorder 3004 a depressed mood for most of the day for more days than not as indicated either by subjective account or observation by others for at least 2 years andrew has indicated that he has been depressed for as far as he can remember before the accident that left his mother paralyzed andrew felt depressed by the fact that he couldn’t make his mother happy after causing his mother to be paralyzed he also become depressed and was sent to boarding school where he was isolated from his family he shows a great amount of guilt for his mother’s accident and her recent death b presence while depressed of two or more of the following1 poor appetite or overeating2 insomnia or hypersomnia3 low energy or fatigue4 low selfesteem5 poor concentration or difficulty making decisions6 feelings of hopelessness andrew experiences low energy low selfesteem poor concentration and feelings of hopelessness he seems to have low energy by the way he carries himself he is late to work has no interest and lacks energy when talking to people not being to work on time seems to be a reoccurring event for andrew as his boss mentions his last warning before he is replaced andrew expresses low selfesteem by explaining that he has a “fucked up family” he blames himself for his mother’s accident and remains in isolation most of the time his concentration on important things is also lacking he has driven away with the gas pump still attached to his car and has occasionally not responded to his name being called andrew has a sense of hopelessness he does not have hope in the fact that he can fix the relationship between his father and him c during the 2year period of the disturbance the person has never been without the symptoms in criteria a and b for more than 2 months at a time andrew meets this by explaining that he has felt this way from at least the age of nine before his mother’s accident he felt like he could not make her happy when she was depressed he is also to blame for his mother’s accident and has been in therapy for depression since the age of 9 d no major depressive episode has been present during the first 2 years of the disturbance ie the disturbance is not better accounted for by chronic major depressive disorder major depressive disorder or in partial remission the criteria of dysthymia are met due to the amount of time that andrew has experienced these depressed symptoms it is estimated that he has had these symptoms for approximately 17 years no major depressive episode has occurred he has successfully carried a job and has played a major role in a film e there has never been a manic episode a mixed episode or a hypomanic episode and criteria have never been met for cyclothymic disorder it is not apparent that andrew has had manic mixed or hypomanic episodes the depression seems to remain at a consistent level over the time period estimated to be depressed he does not meet the criteria for cyclothymic disorder because andrew has not experienced or expressed levels of hypomanic episodes he also has not experienced as time period of 2 or more months were he has shown no symptoms of depression f the disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or delusional disorder andrew shows no symptoms of a chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or delusional disorder g the symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition eg hypothyroidism andrew shows no symptoms that occur from drug or medication abuse the lithium that andrew has been taking is to help his depression and aggression and he shows no signs of abusing it he has experienced some drug and alcohol use however it appears that it is only in social situations and he expressed signs of hesitation and has refused drugs from peers h the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning andrew’s symptoms have significantly impaired his social relationship with peers friends coworkers and his father he shows little interest in having friends around and has been isolating himself for a long period of time he has no relationship with his father and other family members and has isolated himself from them as well andrew’s job as a waiter seems to be coming to an end he is consistently late and is on his last warning before he job position is replaced early onset – occurred before the age of 9 and has continued through his adulthood accuracy of portrayal when the average person watches andrew it is obvious that he is depressed it is also obvious that this depression has lasted a significant amount of time and has been consistent he shows that he is suffering with depression more often than not however there are times where it seems as if andrew is not depressed such as when he is with his newest female friend yet andrew still shows apparent symptoms of depression and guilt that would categorize him with dysthymia disorder one may inaccurately portray andrew as someone who has major depressive disorder but this is not the case andrew’s depression has lasted more than two years and he is depressed for most of the time they may also label him with drug abuse however drugs are not a consistent player in his life he knows to refuse it and to my knowledge has done ecstasy once after pressure from peers treatment pharmacotherapy would be the most effective treatment for andrew’s dysthymia andrew has been on antidepressants and involved in therapy since the age of nine he has been heavily medicated with lithium prescribed by his father from a mental health professional perspective andrew should not be on lithium it is obviously not helping him or eliminating the depression he is feeling the lithium dosage is too high and maybe triggering some of the depression he is experiencing trying another form of antidepressants and finding the correct amount needed with the addition to psychotherapy appears to be the most effective treatment for andrew psychotherapy should be incorporated with andrew’s treatment plan once his pharmacotherapy has been correct and is showing significant results in decreasing his depression therapy involving his father in attempt to repair their relationship should also be in andrew’s treatment plan this could relieve a lot of the stress and guilt built up in the both of them talk therapy is shown to benefit those with dysthymia it will give him an opportunity to talk about his problems and learn ways to deal with him in a healthy manner cognitive behavior therapy could also be helpful in treating andrew’s dysthymia disorder here he can go over and review that his behavior as a child needs to be put in the past he needs help realizing that what has happened cannot be taken back but instead needs to be moved on from bulimia nervosa name shelly hunter source hunger point movie 2003 background information shelly hunter

and puts great strains on her body to reach that approval hunter’s life is devoted to her weight her time is spent obsessing about being slender she does not know how to cope with her eating disorder and her irrational views on being skinny the eating disorder is also causing severe mental problems with hunter she is exhibiting signs of depression and distrust from her family description of the problem hunter displays the symptoms of an eating disorder she is abnormally underweight for her age and is very unhealthy she exhibits the characteristics of bulimia nervosa she eats very little when she is in the presence of other people most undoubtedly when she is eating in front of her mother she becomes very self conscious about what and how much she eats after restraining from food intake for a period of time she then will over eat she stuffs herself with large portions of food after doing so she begins to feel shame and guilt for over eating the way she deals with her guilt is to self induce vomiting this purging is a defense mechanism hunter uses to cope with “disappointing” herself as well as her mother although it only lasts for a short while she feels satisfied with her body

large portions of food alone b recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain such as selfinduced vomiting misuse of laxatives diuretics enemas or other medications

too slender and unhealthy to others she views herself as overweight e the disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa hunter will eat very little for a short period of time and then she will binge eat to selfinduce vomiting accuracy of portrayal the average person watching this movie would see an accurate portrayal of the behavioral characteristics of bulimia nervosa hunter displays the onset characteristics of someone suffering from this disorder someone watching this movie would learn that having an eating disorder can cause many other problems hunter became very untrusting and displayed signs of depression bulimia nervosa took control over hunter’s life and began to affect her mentally therefore the movie hunger point portrays an accurate depiction of bulimia nervosa treatment after fully examining hunter it might be best to start her on some medications to help with depression tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris could be prescribed to elevate her mood vitamin and mineral supplements would be prescribed until signs of deficiency disappeared and normal eating patterns were reestablished the vitamins would also help to treat acid reflux caused by bulimia after hunter’s weight becomes stabilized it would be a good idea to start a behavioral therapy program this will help to change the mindset of hunter and her negative views about her body this will also help to control her binge eating habits not only does hunter need individual therapy but she and her mother need family therapy mrs hunter needs therapy in order to understand that her obsessive beliefs about being slender caused her daughter to become diagnosed with bulimia nervosa communication exercises will be exhibited to help resolve conflict and reestablishing boundaries the treatments will better help hunter to have control over bulimia nervosa and to gradually overcome the disorder name blair waldorf source gossip

model so blair suffers slightly with separation anxiety and depression her mother has very high status in manhattan and would do anything to keep it that way blair and her mother get into arguments every now and then but no more than a normal teen and her mother blair is an only child serena is blair’s best friend and has been since they were little blair is snobbier of the two and serena keeps her grounded without going overboard they often get into tiffs but always end up making up blair’s exboyfriend is nate they dated from age 5 until 16 dealing with the breakup of her longtime lover blair goes a little crazy and her separation anxiety and depression shows up again blair drinks often and for some reason in the world that she lives in adults do not seem to care she could walk into a bar and drink martinis all night and it would be completely normal she does not do drugs however her biggest life difficulty is staying queen bee at her high school she goes through a lot throughout the show but staying the most popular girl in school is always her top priority her number one goal is to attend yale after she graduates and later become a trophy wife just like her mother was blair copes with her problems by putting other people down she loves the fact that she is at the top of the totem pole and she is not afraid to let anyone and everyone know it she also often uses alcohol to cope with her problems description of the problem during the first season of gossip girl the fact that blair had been to treatment in her past comes up a few times blair’s eating habits are normal for the first few episodes but after she experiences different stressors her eating habits become abnormal again she starts to pick at food most of the time but binges at other times also her best friend serena and her mother started to bring up the fact that her symptoms were returning she completely closed them off and ignored the fact that they were every time that she would get into a fight with serena her ex boyfriend or her mother her lack of control for eating would return one incident that was shown on the show was that blair had gotten into a huge fight with serena on thanksgiving which caused blair to be extremely snappy with her mother she found out that her mother lied to her about her father coming into town for the holiday which caused a fight with her mother as well she was picking at her thanksgiving meal during dinner and when her mother told her to go pick out a dessert she stormed off to the kitchen she found an apple pie that she wanted to eat but instead of just taking one piece she stared at it for a few minutes and binged and ate the entire pie immediately she went into her bathroom and started to purposely vomit she has always had an issue with her selfimage and the binging and purging was her solution to make herself feel better after vomiting in her bathroom she called serena and she quickly came over and let blair cry on her shoulder this is not the only incident that blair had with binging and purging but it was a very critical event to blair’s illness diagnosis the diagnosis for blair waldorf fits most appropriately with bulimia nervosa 30751 to be diagnosed with bulimia nervosa you must have the following characteristics recurrent episodes of binge eating an episode of binge eating is characterized by the following eating in a discrete period of time eg within any 2hour period an amount of food that is larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances a sense of lack of control of eating during an episode eg a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating blair waldorf displays both of these characteristics when she has an episode it is as if she cannot control what food she is putting into her body or how much food she is putting into her body recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain such as selfinduced vomiting misuse of laxatives diuretics or other medications fasting or excessive exercise blair waldorf will do whatever she thinks is necessary to prevent weight gain and her methods of choice are selfinduced vomiting and fasting the binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur on average at least once a week for three months the television show does not state what age blair waldorf started binge eating but while she was only 16 years old her mother discussed blair already having gone to treatment for her bulimia so this must have been a problem in her life for quite a few years selfevaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight blair waldorf is very self conscious of her body image and her weight her mother mentions a few times that she needs to watch her weight so this may have helped lead to blair’s body image issues the disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa blair waldorf will eat a very small amount and continue to pick at food at every meal until another episode of binging and purging occurs accuracy of portrayal the average person watching gossip girl and watching blair with her eating disorder would learn the behavioral characteristics of bulimia nervosa someone watching this television show would understand that it is a disorder that a person cannot necessarily always control there can be triggers that can lead to an episode just like any other illness this portrayal is accurate of bulimia nervosa however the show does not show the seriousness as much as it should of this disorder it was mislabeled in this way because it has affected blair’s mental health so any issue in her life that leads to her showing any signs of depression will most likely lead to an episode this is her way of dealing with problems in her life and gossip girl does not show the severity of this treatment after evaluating blair waldorf’s condition it would be best to start her with a behavioral therapy program she was not taught the proper way to handle her emotions and deal with problems that arise in her life and therapy would help approach these issues therapy could also approach her body image issues and help her to devise an exercise program that would make her feel more in shape and healthy her mother and her friends would have to help monitor her eating habits but after understanding her condition fully and seeing that there are other ways of dealing with issues blair would take on a better eating schedule also putting blair on a very low dosage antidepressant or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssri’s and monitoring her progress very closely while on this medication would help a great deal communication exercises will also be necessary between blair and her mother to teach them how to discuss this illness in a healthier manner these different treatments will in time help blair overcome this disorder she will be able to talk about her feelings and problems rather than regressing to binging and purging histrionic personality disorder name michael scott source the office american television show 20052011background information michael scott is a fortysix year old

known medical conditions held by scott though his family history is unknown he claims to be of english irish german scottish and native american descent though this is unconfirmed and perhaps an exaggeration the patient’s outward appearance is well put together as he presents as a business professional and there are no obvious health concerns despite his seemingly composed demeanor scott displays exaggerated emotions and reactions in addition to this romantic relationships have proven turbulent for scott throughout his life as he goes from one relationship to the next with the other person usually being the one to end it he has few close friends or relatives and tends to perceive new friendships as closer than they actually are scott believes his subordinates to be his family and often times gets involved in their personal lives without their consent his parents divorced when he was young age unknown and he displays clear resentment towards his stepfather and sister whom he once didn’t talk to for fifteen years scott has a very close relationship with his mother now though this was not case when he was a child though scott seems to be lacking in managerial style responsibility and delegation he demonstrates above average sales abilities due to his personable qualities scott does not have a history of drug or alcohol abuse though he will drink in social situations and when pressured to do so by coworkers description of the problem the patient demonstrates many personality traits that could be indicative of a variety of disorders scott seeks attention every opportunity he gets and this often interferes with his ability to function in his job as manager in addition to attentionseeking scott often interrupts his subordinates from working to discuss his personal life this behavior not only affects his ability to work but it interferes with the overall productivity of the office it is scott’s belief that he should not be seen as just a boss but more of a close friend and even family member to the dismay of his subordinates this expectation of a close bond leads scott to display rapidly shifting emotions from exuberant and hopeful to depressed and hopeless there seems to be a lack of consistency in his behavior rather a dramatic shift from extremely happy to irreversibly sad in scott’s depressed state he feels as if the entire office should be focused on his problem and that others’ problems pale in comparison such as his birthday being of more importance than a coworkers cancer scare when he is happy however work at the office ceases to a halt as his wellbeing is put before the needs of the company in addition to his attentionseeking and rapidly shifting emotions the patient is easily suggestible and is often the victim of pyramid schemes and persuasive coworkers scott also shows a pattern of theatric behavior including different characters voices and personalities in which he uses as distractions on a constant basis diagnosis the diagnosis that seems to fit most appropriately for scott is histrionic personality disorder 30150 to qualify for a diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder a person must display the following general criteria of a personality disorder a an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture this pattern is manifested in two or more of the following areas1 cognition ie ways of perceiving and interpreting self other people and events2 affectivity ie the range intensity and appropriateness of emotional response3 interpersonal functioning4 impulse control mr scott displays dysfunctions in many if not all of the above categories his thoughts are consumed by his thinking that he is a comedian consistently referring to his improv classes and impersonations the affectivity displayed by the patient is continuously out of proportion to the situation such as halting the workday for an office meeting over a minor problem oftentimes a nonwork related problem his interpersonal and relationship functioning is severely limited demonstrated by his lack insight into the true feelings ie distain of the people in his life his impulse control is lacking if not nonexistent b the enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations the displayed symptoms cause and have caused significant distress in the areas of work relationships friendships and romantic relationships the observed behavior also has negative consequences in many aspects of his life including resentment and distain from coworkers as well as from his superiors and romantic partners c the enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning the inflexible nature of his symptoms clearly affects his ability to function in his daytoday tasks his ability to function is severely impacted by his need for attention as he demonstrates a lack of motivation and productiveness in his occupation and social life this enduring pattern has also led to resentment from his subordinates who believe he is incompetent due to his emotional outbursts d the pattern is stable and of long duration and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood scott’s symptoms have been present for at least six years though they seem to have been present during his entire employment at dunder mifflin and are pervasive in both his work and personal life the symptoms can be traced back to his early adulthood as demonstrated by his lack of friendships and romantic relationships in the past the symptoms may also be a result of early childhood experiences as he lacked a fatherfigure and his mother seemingly neglected him e the enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder although the patient demonstrates some characteristics consistent with narcissistic personality disorder he is too suggestible to fit this criteria as those with narcissistic pd are interpersonally exploitative scott demonstrates a need for immediate attention as opposed to a need for future success neither mood psychotic nor anxiety disorders better account for his symptoms f the enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition eg head trauma the presenting symptoms are not the result of drugs alcohol or head trauma to fit the diagnostic criteria for 30150 histrionic type at least five or more of the following criteria must be met1 uncomfortable in situations in which they are not the center of attention in many instances such as making a coworkers wedding all about him caring more about his superficial wound than an employee with a concussion holding impromptu meetings to discuss his personal life or dozens of other examples scott demands the attention be on him and only him typically in a situation in which he is not the center of attention scott is visibly uncomfortable and can barely sit still2 interaction with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior although scott does not demonstrate sexually seductive behavior he exhibits provocative behavior on a regular basis by use of inappropriate jokes or sexual advances on coworkers3 displays rapid shifting and shallow expressions of emotions scott goes from angry to upset to jealous to happy to ecstatic very rapidly and displays a pattern of shallow emotions for instance after hitting a coworker with his car the patient displayed little remorse or genuine emotion4 consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self5 has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail6 shows selfdramatization theatricality and exaggerated expression of emotion after a superficial wound the patient exaggerated the symptoms for the entire day demanding the focus of that workday be on his recovery scott also demonstrates theatricality through use of characters voices and impromptu presentations7 is suggestible ie easily influenced by others or circumstances scott is highly suggestible and has been observed to lose substantial amounts of money in pyramid schemes due to his trusting nature and easily influenced personality the patient is so suggestible that he has participated in highly risky behaviors such as placing his face in drying cement from pressure from those around him8 considers relationships more intimate than they actually are in many aspects of his life the patient demonstrates a destructive attachment style oftentimes believing those around him are closer to him than they actually are scott believes the office staff to be his family and considers a temporary employee to be his best friend after only one day of knowing him as with his friendships scott’s personal relationships suffer from the same overzealous attitude while once dating a woman scott placed his own photo over the photo of her exhusband while also proposing to her after three dates accuracy of portrayal to those watching the office the portrayal of michael scott as a person with histrionic personality disorder is quite good though those with the disorder are more often females than males those with histrionic personality disorder are known to use their body as a seductive tool and scott’s portrayal lacks this important quality of the disorder however due to the differing presentation of histrionic personality disorder between men and women this trait may be unnecessary for the diagnosis the sudden change of emotion is quite accurately portrayed as well as the attentionseeking behavior patterns as symptom expression is accurately portrayed so too is the onset of symptoms histrionic pd is expressed most often in a person’s early adult years and those with the disorder typically come from a family history of neglect or lack of attention from the primary caregiver during pivotal developmental years for this reason the attentionseeking and selfcentered behavior tends to manifest later in life as a result of the early experience this symptom is accurately portrayed in the show as well overall the portrayal of michael scott as a person with histrionic personality disorder is accurate in many ways treatment the best course of treatment for scott would be therapy cognitivebehavioral therapy would be beneficial in a similar way by helping him to cope with his emotional outbursts cbt would provide scott tools for controlling his behavior in a more systematic and structured way to be able to function more productively in the workplace in addition to systematic planning it is recommended that scott be given assertiveness training to help with his propensity for taking advice from others behavioral rehearsals may aid in his workplace manner and help him to establish appropriate workplace behaviors although family counseling is not an option it is recommended that scott participate in relationship counseling to help establish a longlasting stable relationship name regina george source mean girls movie 2004 background information regina george is a sixteen year old caucasian female she is a junior in high school

hot as possible while they put others down in the process as previously mentioned regina comes from a very affluent family they live in a beautiful mansion considered to be the biggest and most lavish house out of any of the ‘mean girl clique’ regina’s relationship with her parents is very twisted and abnormal one example of this backward relationship is displayed when regina brings her friends over and her mom insists on inserting herself into regina and her friend’s conversations not only does her mom think of her as her best friend but her parents allowed her take the master bedroom simply because she desired it regina does not have a strong relationship with either parent but drifts more toward her mother regina george has a preoccupation with her looks she is constantly talking about how she is either too fat or that she is not pretty enough and also seeks confirmation about her body and looks through others she does not have a regular drinking problem or drug abuse issue since she is so preoccupied with her appearance and that would definitely tarnish her ideal reputation her obsession with her appearance would have to be one of her biggest weaknesses with regard to her weight she is constantly seeking new and unsearched ways of losing weight description of the problem this patient displays many of the traits associated with a number of personality disorders but most strongly shows symptoms of histrionic personality disorder regina george is an attention junkie she seeks out attention from people in every aspect of her daily life this hunger for attention has created tension between regina and her group of friends her need for attention impairs her abilities to function inside the classroom hindering her performance in school regina often wears seductive clothing that most girls and women would not walk out the front door in let alone wear to school another way regina actively seeks attention is by talking about people behind their backs in a three way phone call she deliberately tries to sabotage one of her close friend’s relationships with another close friend of hers this attack displays her need to be needed she felt threatened by their relationship so the only means of coping with the problem to her was by pinning two of her friends against each other when regina has a problem the only way she knows to resolve it is by making someone else feel inferior along with these distorted coping skills regina displays extreme variances in her emotions when she is happy she is through the moon happy and when she is mad she is definitely going to let someone know about it when regina has a problem going on in her life she thinks that every single one of her friends must stop what they are doing and solve the problem with or for her one example of this is shown when regina is eating lunch wants something else to eat and then she says that she is really trying to lose five pounds she is flabbergasted when the rest of the clique does not immediately pipe in to say that she is already flawless diagnosis the diagnosis that seems to fit most appropriately for regina george is histrionic personality disorder 30150 to qualify for a diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder a person must display the following general criteria of a personality disorder a an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture this pattern is manifested in two or more of the following areas1 cognition ie ways of perceiving and interpreting self other people and events2 affectivity ie the range intensity and appropriateness of emotional response3 interpersonal functioning4 impulse control regina george has shown impairments through all of these conditions she has shown that all that consumes her thoughts is the obsession she has with her appearance and the appearance of others her displayed affectivity is most often over exaggerated to the situation most notable was her reaction to her “friend” not inviting her to her house party she single handedly brought the entire student body to a crippling halt by sharing a “burn book” with them this book contained pictures and captions written by regina herself about different people in their school the pictures were not the most flattering and the captions were mean spirited and hurtful to say the least b the enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations her symptoms have caused her significant turmoil in her relationships at home school and in her daily life her behavior has caused many issues in all aspects of her life such as with friends turning against her her family not being very supportive and the entire student body rallying against her c the enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning regina’s apparent inflexible nature has caused tremendous impairment among her social life as well as her occupational or school life regina’s preoccupation with her outward appearance has left her little if any time to focus on things that really matter to people such as her character and demeanor towards others d the pattern is stable and of long duration and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood the behaviors that regina displays in the movie mean girls has been going on her entire life per her mother’s report she has been the same appearance obsessed girl since she was born this pattern of attention seeking mean behavior escalated in middle school when she made up a rumor about a girl being a lesbian in the eighth grade e the enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder this patient does display some of the characteristics of a person with narcissistic personality disorder and perhaps even some dependent pd characteristics but the disorder that regina displays through the entire movie is hpd f the enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition eg head trauma the symptoms are not as a result of drugs alcohol or any general medical condition to fit the diagnostic criteria for 30150 histrionic type at least five or more of the following criteria must be met uncomfortable in situations in which they are not the center of attention regina george is not only uncomfortable in situations in which she is

pretty as or prettier than her regina makes a consorted effort to make that girl her new best friend forever interaction with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior regina definitely displays this behavior in every aspect of her life she cannot even sing in the christmas talent show without being in a midriff tube top shirt with a matching much too short skirt displays rapid shifting and shallow expressions of emotions regina has an extremely wide range of shallow emotions for example when she is confronted with an old friend the one she spread the lesbian rumor about she shrugs it off as if it never happened her ability to show no remorse and be so nonchalant about something that destroyed a young impressionable human being show her shallow expression of emotion consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self she uses her body her beauty and her weight to keep people focused on herself when someone tries to shift the conversation she always finds a way to get the attention back on herself has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail regina has an immature speaking style when talking in the cafeteria she uses many words that are not even words such as ‘skeeze’ to describe other students shows selfdramatization theatricality and exaggerated expression of emotion in regard to her constant obsession with her weight regina has all of her friends focus on the things that she should be doing on her own to lose the weight when regina goes to a dress shop to be fitted for her prom dress and finds that she cannot fit the one she wants she has a tyrannical outburst is suggestible ie easily influenced by others or circumstances regina is highly suggestible especially since she does not focus on the facts she is a person who will take a person for their word when one of her friends tries to help her with a “weightloss” bar she takes it without question she is shocked to later find out that the bars she has been eating for the past few months has been the sole contributor to her slow but steady weight gain considers relationships more intimate than they actually are accuracy of portrayal to the average person watching the movie mean girls regina george would seem like the typical high school bitch she is popular pretty and most of all rich to most laypeople they would not think to make the connection that she has histrionic personality disorder even though she does a phenomenal job portraying an individual with this disorder regina displays the symptom most commonly associated with having histrionic personality disorder those being sexually seductive behaviors regina is sexually seductive in appropriate times such as high school girls and halloween but most notably she is seductive at times when it is completely inappropriate her extreme variances and range of shallow emotions are another key symptom of histrionic personality disorder the fact that regina is unhappy and uncomfortable with not being the center of attention is another symptom of histrionic personality disorder the portrayal of regina george in the movie mean girls is an accurate portrayal a person living with histrionic personality disorder treatment the best treatment for histrionic personality disorder is through therapy the most effective therapy treatment would be cognitive behavioral therapy cognitive behavioral therapy would help regina to be able to control her emotionality better as well as give her some tools to cope with life in a more adaptive

reports and it has been witnessed that tate’s mother is very controlling and overly protective tate complains that her mother inhibits her freedom and does not allow her to try new activities although this causes selfreported strain in their relationship tate still says she is close to her mother tate is very social and seems to have a positive base line of friends her goal is to become a veterinary assistant in the future and continue to gain freedom from her controlling mother her daily activities include going to her classes and spending time with her significant other and family description of the problem tate currently has a lowered iq probably around 70 although further testing would be necessary and impaired cognitive processes her mother and father report that these

class for her height she has not reported physical problems and none have been observed her mood is very positive and open however she sometimes displays rapid mood swings and quickly gets upset at what most view trivial things diagnosis carla tate appears to meet the criteria for mild mental retardation 3170 a significantly subaverage intellectual functioning an iq of approximately 70 or below on an individually administered iq test for infants a clinical judgment for significantly subaverage intellectual functioning although not specifically told tate has been diagnosed with a lowered iq because she went to a certified school for individuals with lowered iq 2 concurrent deficits or impairments in present adaptive functioning ie the persons effectiveness in meeting the standards expected for his or her age by his or her cultural group in at least two of the following areas1 communication2 selfcare3 home living4 socialinterpersonal skills5 use of community resources6

qualifies for social and interpersonal skills impairment although she is an outgoing individual she sometimes misinterprets situations she also acts out and causes scenes in socially inappropriate places overall she takes direction well but she often misunderstands what the instructions are if they are not given to her very simplistically her functional academic skills are also impaired although tate does attend bay area poly technical school she struggles to keep up with the other students and can only master basic concepts although no tests have been conducted her iq is estimated to be around 70 tate also currently does not maintain employment at any job although tate is relatively safe there have been past reported incidences by her mother and tate herself of inflicting harm on other children by accident and setting accidental fires which falls under safety tate does meet the criteria for mild retardation which she has been diagnosed with and treated for in a special school but she is relatively normally functioning in daytoday life b onset before the age of 18 tate’s parents were alerted of her learning difficulties and social impairments around the age of 8 or 9 no specific age was given she was sent to a special school soon after because her parents felt they could not help her adequately c stable iqs from early in life to adulthood as reported by her mother tate has maintained a longitudinal average of a lowered iq from her early childhood to present accuracy of portrayal the average person watching this movie would automatically be able to diagnose tate as someone who is mentally retarded however many individuals do not understand that different levels of mental retardation exist based on iq scores although mild retardation is the most common level of retardation accounting for 6575 of all diagnoses of mental retardation most of the population lump all forms of mental retardation together another fallacy which might be correct with an everyday person watching this movie is understanding that although mentally retarded individuals are limited in some of their functions they can become with supportive help a very productive member of society one possible misconception the movie might give viewers is the idea that mentally retarded individuals normally come from a higher ses and often have people to take care of their needs however statistically most people with a mental handicap especially people with mild retardation come from a low ses neighborhood they often become homeless or wards of the state because of lack of specialized training and education treatment there is no cure for mental retardation the goal of treatment is to maximize her potential in every area of life despite her mental condition special teachers and programs intervention at the youngest age possible is recommended which she received tate should be trained not only in life skills and academic areas at her level but also in social skills and selfcontrol family therapy should also be conducted to help the family better understand her condition and to help her family better know what are the most effective ways of dealing with her they should also be informed of her abilities and limitations tate is a highly functioning female with mental retardation and therefore needs less care from her family however because her mother is slightly controlling it limits tate’s autonomy which is very essential for all humans especially for someone with mental retardation this situation should be addressed and healthy boundaries should be agreed upon among tate her mother and the therapist autonomy will allow tate to develop to her full potential and has shown great success in the past with other similar patients name charles gordon source flowers for algernon movie 2000 background information the main character of this movie is charlie gordon a mentally challenged 32yearold man with an iq of 68 who works at a bakery as a delivery boy and moonlights as a janitor he also attends the adult school for the mentally retarded at night after work charlie is a simple man with simple goals one of his goals in life is for people to like him when charlie was little his mother and father abandoned him shortly after they discovered that he is mentally challenged charlie was put in a foster home when he was merely a child when he is old enough to make a living he moves out and lives by himself in a deteriorated apartment in the middle of a suburban area a place that he could afford isolated and alone since childhood charlie yearns for close relationships as a result it is no surprise that he wants to be liked and wanted for example occasionally at the work place he would act like a clown eg pretend to slip and fall put flour on his nose make funny faces etc in hope to make his coworkers laugh because he thinks that they like him and are his “friends” but alas little does he knows that they are not laughing with him but at him one day at the adult school his special education teacher ms kinnian –who is very impressed with his freespirit friendliness and curiosity to learn –tells him about the brainoperation experiment an experiment that promises to make people like him smart charlie immediately signs up for the experiment because he feels that if he is smart then maybe people would like him more after the controversial experimental brain surgery charlies iq increases at an exponential rate tripling his original iq at 185 with ms kinnians guidance charlie also learned to read advanced level books such as robinson crusoe mathematical quadrants etc and write in comprehensive sentences as demonstrated in his “progris riports”shortly after the brainoperation charlie explores his inner feelings and emotions such as betrayal jealousy love and pain that he never thought he had he begins to understand the world around him for example after the brain surgery he begins to understand that his coworkers arent really his real friends after all because real “friends” would not invite you to bars and poke fun at you in front of everyone for good laughs in addition before the brainsurgery he never knew he could fall in love and reciprocate his feelings but as time goes by his feelings for ms kinnian develop alas the ephemeral love between ms kinnian and charlie does not last the movie ends with charlie telling ms kinnian goodbye the day he learns that the experiment would not work and that he would have to go back to being the mentally challenged man that he once was before the reversal of his intelligence while he is still able to think and make decision charlie moves far away to another place to live a place where ms kinnian cannot find him as a man who is mentally challenged charlie has many difficulties and challenges in life as you can see his life difficulties involve deficits in intellectual abilities and functioning such as the ability to read write and speak in coherence sentences he may have learning disabilities such as written expression as demonstrated in his “progris riports” reading disorder and more he also has difficulties in establishing interpersonal and social relationships because he does not have the ability to read facial cues and expressions little is known about his family mental health history charlie does not seem to have drug or alcohol problems he also does not seem to have physical impairments but mostly psychological and cognitive impairments description of the problem life is already hard and life is even harder if you have mental retardation as demonstrated in the movie flowers for algernon charlie shows significant limitations in intellectual functioning such as not being able to read write and communicate coherently he demonstrates maladaptive symptoms such as emotional deficits and interpersonal problems he does not seem to have sensory symptoms his sensory modalities work fine he can work and make a low profile and honest living as a delivery person and janitor at the bakery he is not physically handicapped or in any way from the movie charlie is a mentally challenged man with an iq of 68 and the symptoms that he shows qualify him for mild mental retardation mmr which will be discussed in the diagnosis section he is portrayed as a carefree and happy person whose personality is almost childlike he is not passive placid dependent nor aggressive he does not have severe nor profound mental retardation and he does not depend on anyone to dress for him or take care of him but he does show signs of lack of communication skills developmental delays social and emotional deficits impaired ability to solve or understand social problems and issues and impaired ability in recognizing emotion in others his academic performance is also affected by his mental delays as a result he goes to the adult school for the mental retarded instead of going to college he can adapt easily at his working place such as working as a delivery boy janitor and running errands except that he does not have the capability to use a dough mixing machine which requires the ability to follow instructions the symptoms that charlie has qualify him for mmr he does not have selfinjurious behaviors or stereotypical movements overall charlie can function adequately at a slow pace environment an environment that does not require higher order thinking and decision making abilities diagnosis charlie gordon meets the criteria for mild mental retardation 3170 using the criteria from the dsmivtr a significantly subaverage intellectual functioning an iq of approximately 70 or below on an individually administered iq test gordon has an iq level of 68 since childhood this qualifies him as having significantly subaverage intellectual ability b concurrent deficits or impairments in present adaptive functioning ie the person’s effectiveness in meeting the standards expected for his or her age by his or her culture group in at least two of the following areas 1 communication 2 selfcare 3 home living 4 socialinterpersonal skills 5 use of community resources 6 selfdirection 7 functional academic skills 8 work 9 leisure 10 health and 11 safety gordon meets more than two symptoms of the above areas he has problems in 1 communication 4 socialinterpersonal skills 6 selfdirection 7 functional academic skills and 9 leisure he does not have deficits in 3 home living 5 use of community resources 8 work 10 health and 11 safety c the onset is prior to 18 years of age gordon has shown signs of mental retardation since childhood the onset must be before the age of 18 hence he also meets this criterion accuracy of portrayal the movie does a good job in describing someone with mental retardation especially a man with mild mental retardation this movie was adapted from the original novel flowers for algernon written by daniel keyes keyes knew what he was doing when he was writing this novel he had worked at many mental retardation facilities and had worked as a special education teacher before he wrote this novel with the skills and trainings that he developed he was able to describe in details the behaviors that he had observed from his students with mental disabilities such as how they talk write associate with others and so on a person watching this movie would not be misled but be persuaded by the information that this movie provides and how it accurately portrays someone with this mental disorder a person watching this movie would also get to learn more about mmr and the symptoms that a person with this disorder has treatment currently there is no cure for mental retardation mental disorder are an enduring and pervasive disease which is why it is listed on axis ii but several empirical supported studies show that therapy special education and training and social skill training can help ease the symptoms of mental retardation mental retardation is not an easy disorder to treat since it is related to genetic factors such as irregular genes or genes that did not fuse together properly ie down syndrome and environment factors eg infections chromosomal abnormalities metabolic and nutritional especially for persons with low socioeconomic status ses it is also important for a trained specialist to evaluate the person for comorbidity with other disorders such as attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder mood disorders pervasive developmental disorders stereotypical movement disorder down syndrome fragile x and more since these disorders may also affect the diagnosis and outcomes the prognosis depends on the severity of the disorder such as mild moderate severe and profound the less severe the levels and the early the treatment the better the outcomes many people may lead productive lives and function on their own whereas others need a structured environment to be most successful specific phobia name ronald “ron” billius weasley source the harry potter series by j k rowling books 19972007background information ron weasley is first presented to the public audience as a young goofy 11yearold wizard boy throughout the series he transitions into a mature young adult he attends hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry overall he is an average student never going above in expectations and never going under he is the youngest boy in the weasley family out of bill charlie percy fred and george he also has a younger sister ginny who he is very protective of his mother molly is an incredibly loving woman taking care of her children and running a very crazy household her husband’s name is arthur weasley and he works a modest job at the ministry of magic the weasley family is very rare in the wizardry world because they come from what is known as pureblood this means that the weasley family only have witch and wizard blood in their biological line it is rare and often used by other wizardry family has a way to declare dominance among their kind the weasleys however do not mistreat others and do not consider themselves to be above the rest of the wizardry population their good nature is one of the few things they are rich with as there are very poor with only a modest income they have been known to pass on handed down clothing among the children and make them handmade gifts because they cannot afford much else they struggle finically with getting their children everything they need for school and they live in a small house that is referred to as the burrow ron has a particularly difficult time dealing with the teasing that is brought on to his family because of their financial standing he often has to defend his family to other people especially towards draco malfoy who is not afraid to bring up the handed down clothing whenever he wants to insult ron ron has two best friends at his school they are the beautiful and very smart hermione granger and the ever popular boywholived harry potter they have all been close since their first year in hogwarts when they all started battling against the evil wizard voldemort the relationship among these best friends however has often been rocky hermione and ron fight constantly and as the books progress you can start to see a romantic relationship form it is not until the final book that the audience completely knows the true feelings between these two characters ron and harry instantly became best friends but it was often hard for ron to stand in the background of harry’s ever growing shadow this caused a lot of tension between the two but in the end the relationship stayed strong the biggest problem ron faced in his life was the financial wellbeing of his family he was very lucky to have both of his parents still alive and not have to face the torment that was given to hermione from being muggleborn once he completes his seven years of training at hogwarts ron wants to become an auror who are known for catching evil wizards he is very good at chess and likes to use strategies to help him in difficult situations during his years in school ron saw himself as the head boy and the gryffindor quidditch captain ron has difficultly dealing with certain situations and often lets his anger get the best of him he tends to explode and lash out against others when things become too difficult to bear the biggest weakness he faces is jealousy of those around him he is not completely satisfied with what he has been given and normally wants what others have this makes his relationships sometimes difficult but over time ron began to get over his jealousy issues description of the problem in the second book of the harry potter series the chamber of secrets the audience becomes aware of the fact ron is incredibly afraid of spiders the being around them scares him immensely and the mere idea of spiders turns him into the world’s biggest baby when he is around them he begins to shake and he starts screaming at a high pitch if he is able to form words at all they are difficult to understand his fear stops him in his tracks physiologically his eyes get big he has difficulty breathing and his face sometimes turns white his anxiety is so high in fact that he thinks the end of the world is happening and he must escape from the situation diagnosis it is very clear to see that ron is suffering from a specific phobia in particular arachnophobia this falls under the dsmiv five general types of specific phobias in the animal type category as mentioned earlier ron does not even need to be in the around spiders to be afraid of them only mentioning them is enough to scare him and make him want the conversation shifted to a different topic b exposure to the phobic stimulus almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response which may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally predisposed panic attack children can show affects and characteristics when it comes to specific phobias children can show anxiety by crying throwing tantrums experiencing freezing or clinging to the parent that they have the most connection to his level of anxiety definitely rises as evidenced by how his voice changes he begins sweating profusely he starts shaking and he does everything he can to avoid the situation c the person recognizes that the fear is excessive or unreasonable in ron’s case his fear of spiders started long before his traumatic experience with them in the chamber of the secrets this even may have enhanced his fear but he knows that is fear is often the point of joke and he understands that he sometimes takes it to an extreme level of anxiety however the amount of teasing he gets from others does not stop his fear from being expressed d the phobic situation s is are avoided or else endured with intense anxiety or distress it is clear that ron will do anything to avoid being around spiders including using his wizardry skills on them e the avoidance anxious anticipation or distress in the feared situation s interferes significantly with the persons normal routine occupational or academic functioning social activities or relationships or there is marked distress about having the phobia this does not seem like the case for ron he is able to conquer his fear after he builds up some esteem to do so it is rare for him to walk away from a situation just because spiders are present but it does require him to build up a lot of motivation in order to follow through his normal routine is often just delayed when a spider is present or mentioned f in individuals under age 18 years the duration is at least 6 months throughout the majority of the series ron is under the age of 18 he has had this fear of spiders in the second book when he and harry had to go into the forbidden forest in order to find out if hagrid was really opening the chamber of secrets in the third book the prisoner of azkaban ron and his fellow students at hogwarts were learning how to battle of boggarts which turn into their biggest fear for ron’s case it would turn into a spider since that is his biggest fear in the seventh book the deathly hallows ron is trying to destroy an evil force and it uses his fear against him by making spiders appear in the other books ron’s fear does not have a huge part but it is mentioned in small sections of the book with comments explaining that his fear has been around for quite a long time it is quite clear that every time spiders are mention that ron’s fear comes up as well this definitely exceeds six months g the phobic avoidance associated with the specific object or situation are not better accounted for by another mental disorder such as obsessivecompulsive disorder eg fear of dirt on someone with an obsession about contamination posttraumatic stress disorder eg avoidance of stimuli associated with a severe stressor separation anxiety disorder eg avoidance of school social phobia eg avoidance of social situations because of fear of embarrassment panic disorder with agoraphobia or panic disorder without agoraphobia ron has no other signs of a mental disorder with his fear of spiders it seems like the phobia is the only thing that is causing problems to come about in his life he is actually quite open about his fear of spiders and it is often mentioned in the books to release tension during difficult and dramatic times it is very obvious that ron is afraid of spiders the difference between him and other individuals is that he faces his phobias despite how bad is anxiety responds he fits the criteria and allows for a very clear and diagnosable explanation about his disorder it is not unrealistic to place him in this category of anxiety disorders accuracy of portrayal the portrayal of ron does a very good job of explaining what it would feel like to live with specific phobia and for the audience presents many realistic ideas about arachnophobia the books give good examples about what is going on with ron’s anxiety about the spiders and why he reacts to them in the way he does the main problem with the portrayal is that it is often used for humor in the majority of the books there are points when the phobia is quite obvious and understood in its full meaning but the majority of the time is spent on ron’s phobia being mentioned as a joke for the readers it is used as a nice little sigh of relief during the dramatic parts of this intense book series it is important to remember that the harry potter series is mostly used for entertainment purposes and that sometimes it can over dramatic about humorous moments and complex storylines that allow for a more enjoyable read this causes some of ron’s phobia tactics to be displayed humorously and causes it to be funny and less like a mental disorder treatment the most recommended treatment for ron would be behavioral therapy in this process exposure techniques would be used to allow ron’s anxiety levels to lower during different stages of exposure the exposure to the spiders over a long period of time would eventually causes his anxiety levels to lower greatly this would also cause less intensity with his fear ron’s sessions would start with a small amount of exposure to spiders by first talking about them showing him pictures and being in the same room as one the steps would increase only after ron became comfortable with the spiders and his anxiety levels would level out the steps would increase with exposure until ron was able to hold a spider and not attack it or be afraid it would also be beneficial for ron to go through some cognitive therapy as well this would help him identify with the truth about spiders and help him to stop thinking that they are terrible creatures this would be important because ron is in the magical world and his interactions are different from those in the muggle world ron would be able to show great improvements with his mental disorder but he is however a stubborn red head this might be the only thing to stop him from being successful with his treatment conduct disorder name nelson muntz source the simpsons television series 1989 – present background information nelson muntz is a 10 year old caucasian boy who is a student at springfield elementary school nelson is unemployed and although he is a fulltime student he is on the verge of dropping out his health appears to be in good condition but there was a time when he was exposed to second hand smoking other than that the patient does not seem to have any physical illness however some problems that are observed are how he behaves towards his peers and others nelson is feared by many of his classmate and peers he is known to pick fights with the “nerds”

relationship with them currently he lives with his mom who works at hooters as a waitress his father is mostly absent in his life and as the story goes mr muntz abandoned his son and wife when nelson was really young however there were few times in nelsons’ life where his father does appear such as after a football game where nelson was the star player mr muntz came to congratulate him and invited him to have dinner at hooters but nelson refused because he did not want to see his mother working there mrs muntz is known in the community as a jailbird a prostitute and a stripper mrs marge simpson adopts nelson informally nelson has difficulties in school when it comes to keeping up with his grades although he is known as a bully there are occasions where his good nature comes out and befriends bart simpson and even dated lisa simpson nelson can be very disruptive and noncompliant to rules at school he hangs out with older kids from high school who also show no interest in education nelson has very little in the way of a support group and keeping a friendship is difficult for him nelson can be very demanding and if he does not get what he seeks then there will be consequences to those who get in his way he enjoys seeing the misery of others and in many situations will laugh at their face nelson does not have very strong coping skills if not any he expresses his emotions physically by beating up someone and or by committing pranks and small crimes there is no known history of drug or alcohol use description of the problem nelson muntz displays a multitude of symptoms that are associated with conduct disorder he displays anger and frustration through the act of bullying his peers he shows no respect to authority figures and is disobedient towards them he places no importance on school and constantly picks on the nerds and geeks that attend his school he performs delinquent acts such as stealing looting vandalizing and cheating nelson has made threats to other students and physically harmed them for example when one of his buddies stole lisa simpson’s cupcakes her brother went to defend her by telling nelson’s buddy to back off and soon they engage in a physical fight nelson seeing bart simpson fighting his buddy joins in the fight to defend his friend bart accidently makes nelson’s nose bleed causing nelson to become angrier the fight was interrupted by the school bell indicating recess was over and it was time to go back to class nelson full of anger threatens bart and tells him to meet after school for the next few days after school nelson physically beats bart shoves him into a trash can and rolls him down a hill at one point or another nelson has terrorized virtually everyone in springfield he takes great pride in seeing those he believes to be inferior to him suffer pain and is in misery he delights in other people’s pain and suffering he shows guilt or shame about his misbehavior and often justifies his cruel actions his close friends who are just like him only encourage his behavior and his parents show no concern or interest in their son’s behavior diagnosis the diagnosis that is appropriate for nelson muntz is conduct disorder 31281 a a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major ageappropriate societal norms or rules that are violated as manifested by the presences of three or more of the following criteria in the past 12 months with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months aggressive conduct that threatens physical harm nonaggressive conduct that causes property damage deceitfulness or theft serious violations of rules nelson muntz meets all three of the above criteria his aggression has led to physical harm to others as well as to him he has been involved in vandalism and property damage due to recklessness he has bullied his way into getting things that are not his he has broken many state and school laws as well as showing no obedience to authority figures b to the diagnosed with conduct disorder an onset of at least one criterion characteristic must be displayed prior to age 10 years aggression to people and animals

cruel to people has been physically cruel to animals has stolen while confronting a victim mugging purse snatching extortion armed robbery has forced someone into sexual activity nelson muntz has displayed more than one of these symptoms of conduct disorder prior to age 10 and currently still does these symptoms are described above under the headline “description of the problem” c the disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social academic or occupational functioning nelson muntz has no interest in school and often he is found to cheat on his assignments and exams d if the individual is age 18 years or older criteria are not met for antisocial personality disorder nelson muntz is only 10 years old accuracy of portrayal an average person watching the simpsons would be able to come to conclusion that the character nelson muntz shows abnormal behaviors when compared to his peers they will notice that his lack of a stable home does have a huge role in his delinquent behaviors a person with an abnormal psychology background could easily identify nelson’s behaviors are symptoms of conduct disorder the character nelson muntz is an accurate portrayal of how a child with conduct disorder behaves and acts towards others however in the realistic world such symptoms are worse treatment nelson muntz should have a full medical examination before any treatments are given first nelson’s parents should be educated about the disorder as well as provided with wellestablished treatments nelson’s behaviors should be modified in the class rooms as well as the play grounds treatments such as goal setting and developing ways to reach those goals should be taught to nelson on a onetoone basses nelson’s parents need to be more involved in his life and therefore family therapy is recommended according to research the optimum method seems to be an integrated approach that involves both the child and the family within a variety of contexts throughout the child’s developmental stages as well as his and his family’s life also when nelson misbehaves he should have some sort of consequences for his actions instead of encouraging his behavior therefore grounding or timeout should be enforced attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder name bart simpson source the simpsons television series 1989present background information bart simpson is an eightyearold male with no history of a mental health diagnosis bart has been labeled an “underachiever” by authority figures and has poor grades in school ranging from dminus to f bart can be ingenious regarding things that interest him such as learning portions of the talmud to help reunite his idol krusty the clown with krusty’s father rabbi krustofsky however this drive is absent for schoolrelated performance his academic achievements are behind those of his fourthgrade peers he has a history of consistent and sometimes significant trouble making he also reports feelings of frustration with the narrowminded people in his town for judging him by his problematic thoughts and actions his relationship with his father is volatile and dysfunctional one minute he is being strongly scolded by his father and the next him and his father bond over a collaborative prank he once told bart it was not okay to lose a children’s miniature golf tournament and made bart stare angrily at this opponent for 15 minutes a day there is evidence that his father forgets his youngest daughter even exists bart’s infant sister bart’s mother tends to “overmother” her children and once left the family for a brief period due to a mental breakdown despite this bart has no significant problems in the relationship with his mother bart enjoys skateboarding bubble gum squishees from the kwikemart and a singlehandedly bringing a homicidal tv sidekick to justice – twice family mental health history marge simpson is bart’s mother she is described as a happy homemaker and mother of three marge puts up with the antics of her husband homer bart’s father and children in good spirits for the most part though in 1992 the combined stress of her workload and family’s problems caused her to have a mental breakdown she went away to spend time at “rancho relaxo” before returning home to her overlydependant family marge overmothers her children and reports staying with homer because he makes her feel needed marge speaks out about issues such as violence and moral hygiene the townspeople respond with frustration for her disregard of social norms however she also has a history of gambling addiction she worked to overcome this addiction but it always lingers as a possible problem homer simpson is bart’s father homer’s father abe raised homer in the absence of his “radical hippie mother” homer has a reported low iq of 55 accompanied by periods of forgetfulness and ignorance a crayon was discovered to be lodged in his brain and when removed his iq rose to 105 however he did not like his new ability to understand reason so he had the crayon reinserted this returned his iq to 55 other contributors to his low functioning include his exposure to radioactive waste his alcohol use and repetitive cranial trauma it is uncertain whether his low level of functioning can attributed to genetics or to his life events homer works in a nuclear power plant and has remained an entrylevel employee longer than any other employee prior to that he attempted other jobs on impulse at work he falls asleep constantly and does not perform his duties homer displays regular instances of explosive anger he does not attempt to hide this in public he is ruled by his impulses these impulses combined with his intense rage leads him to strangle bart on occasion his impulses change frequently affecting his attention span he pursues many hobbies and enterprises and then quickly changes his mind about them abraham jay abe simpson is bart’s paternal grandpa he is a grizzled old man who is incredibly longwinded and often ignored the stories he tells seem wildly inaccurate and often consist of events that are physically or historically impossible for example he reports serving in world war i although he was a small child at that time he reports many confrontations with famous figures and writes letters to organizations making unreasonable requests such as asking the president to get rid of three states because there are too many and requesting that modern bride magazine feature more people with wrinkles and toothless grins he reports homicide attempts of adolf hitler via javelin throw in the 1936 olympics it appears that grandpa simpson suffers from some mental health impairment s without knowing his history it is hard to tell whether this is a lifelong disease or one that attributed to old age if he has suffered these delusions for a long period suffice it to say some of bart’s mental health problems could be genetically linked to his grandpa bart’s eightyearold sister lisa is a highachieving student who is already a member of mensa with an iq of 159 she is smart witty and goal oriented lisa does not appear to have any limiting mental health symptoms bart’s younger sister maggie and two maternal aunts are also featured on the show but do not seem to have any notable mental health limitations description of the problem bart displays multiple symptoms that are indicators for several mental health disorders he shows very consistent symptoms for adhd several problems arise as a result of bart being distracted by video games specifically he misses important family announcements because he is so distracted by his video games similarly upon getting a satellite dish bart and his father became so distracted by the television that he could not study for an important achievement test during the test bart continued to be distracted by daydreaming about things he saw on television the night before this resulted in him failing the test and being held back a grade in another instance bart got an f on a test so the school psychiatrist recommended he repeat the fourth grade out of desperation to avoid being held back he promises to study but is repeatedly distracted so did worse on the next test for the third test bart tries to focus while he is studying but is still easily distracted and is forced to slap himself continually to continue his studying the next day still slapping himself he finishes the test to receive a d allowing him to pass by one point during another instance bart also spontaneously interrupts an important lecture there are many more instances where bart becomes distracted leading him to fail at tasks diagnosis the most appropriate diagnosis for bart seems to be attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder under code 3140 he fits the inattentive type meeting the following symptoms 1 2 3 4 6 8 bart displays many problems with attention and distractibility his symptoms seem sufficient for satisfying this adhd inattentive type criteria however he also displays some dominant symptoms for odd and cd these symptoms undergo dramatic changes from episode to episode creating some difficulties in rendering a diagnosis two

often acts as if driven by a motor5 often talks excessively impulsiveness6 often blurts out answers before questions have been finished7 often has trouble waiting ones turn8 often interrupts or intrudes on others eg butts into conversations or games accuracy of portrayal a viewer of the bart simpson character can see many accurate symptoms of adhd but his character has many overlapping symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder and even conduct disorder his problems with attention are displayed in numerous experiences however he also displays multiple symptoms of deceitfulness serious violations of rules deliberately annoys people and often argues with adults these symptoms are found in individuals with odd or cd however bart does not demonstrate the temper anger or aggressiveness problems that can also be found in odd or cd the bart simpson character does display adhd symptoms with fair accuracy over many different episodes but also displays the ability to effectively organize delinquent behaviors in others which would be less likely for someone with adhd so there are some inconsistencies in his character but that is to be expected for a character with such different dramatic storylines in weekly episodes for over 20 years treatment treatment of bart should begin with a structured or semistructured clinical interview discussing developmental and family history adhd symptoms and symptoms of comorbid problems intelligence testing achievement testing and reports from parents and teachers will also provide valuable insight in light of the 2011 study by dr lidy pelsser of the adhd research centre in the netherlands it seems appropriate to begin bart on restricted nonallergenic diet to eliminate allergens related to adhd symptoms a strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether adhd is induced by food this diet should be followed and monitor his symptoms closely for five weeks if adhd symptoms have not drastically improved or disappeared after five weeks the diet should be ceased and medication will be the next course of action medication should be used to treat bart’s core adhd symptoms central nervous system cns stimulants have a high success rate for adhd bart would begin taking a low dose of ritalin it should be taken two times a day morning before breakfast and at night before dinner he should begin taking 6mg tablets and then can move up to 60mg a day a combination of medication and behavior therapy will be used to treat cooccurring problems for the long term this therapy will promote improvements in the parentchild interactions aggressive responses and social skills parent training can also provide parents with skills to effectively interact with a child with adhd name clark griswold source national lampoon’s christmas vacation movie 1989 background information clark griswold is a fortyfour year old male patriarch of a traditional middleincome family with a wife and two teenage children one son and one daughter clark works as a food additive designer for a large firm his achievement is inconsistent and fluctuates from high level creating a new “varnish” to keep cereal crispy in milk to minimal effort and being “invisible” to his boss although clark proclaims himself as “a regular family man trying to do what’s best for his wife and kids” his actions contradict his behavior on more than one occasion clark has introduced his children as “rusty and what’shername” this verbal outburst demonstrates a subconscious disconnect between beliefs and actions clark’s wife ellen does not display outwardly noticeable symptoms of mental health disorder she demonstrates a loving relationship to her husband aka “sparky” and children although she tends to enable the household behaviors and live in a state of denial about clark’s eccentricities until his behavior is extreme the children both display typical teenage angst and disinterest in family situations both minor children have past experience with illegal substances but do not present addictive behaviors see national lampoon’s vacation 1983 clark’s cousin eddy displays a possible genetic link to maladaptive behaviors for example when clark does not receive his anticipated christmas bonus from work eddy kidnaps clark’s boss clark displays poor coping skills and reacts abruptly and inappropriately in both public and private settings although he lives in constant pursuit of the ultimate family vacation his overall achievement goals are shallow and limited to materialistic gain the close proximity of relatives that may or may not always get along under normal circumstances increases tensions and exacerbates clark’s adhd symptoms family support and understanding for display of symptoms is minimal and inconsistent although time spent together is abundant most of clark’s outbursts or behaviors are dismissed as normal for him as of 1989 clark has received no official mental health diagnosis but has displayed multiple symptoms that his family normally dismisses as “part of his character” individuals from the outside view clark as impulsive and prone to quick outbursts it is possible that clark displayed symptoms before age seven but went undiagnosed due to the lack of information regarding adhd prior to 1970 subsequent controversy and downplay of adhd from critics may have interfered with proper diagnosis and treatment description of the problem clark presents with several significant symptoms pointing to attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder clark is easily distracted and demonstrates an inability to stay on task with everyday items however he does overindulge on items he deems important clark becomes so involved in his quest for the perfect family vacation and christmas lights for the house that he misses quality family time and activities with the group clark has a tendency to behave in an overly energetic manner and is unable to rest or at times maintain an even temperament he is quick to anger at even mundane situations and consistently holds extreme grudges furthermore he shows inappropriate affect and significant impairment in both personal and professional settings for example while christmas shopping for his wife clark is unable to maintain composure with the female working the counter he also displays inappropriate affect and coping behaviors with anger towards his boss by demonstrative and abrupt outbursts diagnosis clark’s symptoms fit best with a diagnosis of attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder 3140 from the dsmivtr with the specific subtype of inattentive type best describing his symptoms clark meets the following symptoms for inattentive type 1 2 3 4 5 8 9 although he presents with symptoms for hyperactiveimpulsive type he does not display the required six or more for a complete diagnosis clark’s hyperactive and impulsive behaviors may be caused by environmental factors the following symptoms must be met to be diagnosed with attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder 1 inattentive type six or more of the following symptoms of inattention have been present for at least 6 months to a point that is disruptive and inappropriate for developmental level 1 often does not give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork work or other activities clark overlooks specific details in personal activities with an elevated risk such as driving or home improvement during a family trip to choose a christmas tree clark became distracted by his frustration with another driver and drove the car directly parallel under the bed of a semitruck he was unaware of his wife’s warnings to stop or that he was pulling under the truck until after the action was complete his home improvement skills lack detail such as the time he stapled his shirt sleeve to the top floor guttering while precariously balanced on a ladder 2 often has trouble keeping attention on tasks or play activities while christmas gift shopping for his wife clark was distracted by the counter attendant and unable to focus on the task at hand he continuously rambled stumbled on words or changed sentence syntax by saying “hooter” instead of “hotter” clark displayed difficulty staying on task or keeping his attention on the purpose of his trip 3 often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly clark’s daughter audrey continuously updated him of her “freezing” body parts during a trek to find the family christmas tree he remained unaware of the situation even after his wife expressed concern that audrey’s eyes were frozen he dismissed the problem once he realized he was being addressed 4 often does not follow instructions and fails to finish schoolwork chores or duties in the workplace not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand instructions failed to latch the ladder placed against his house and slid down to the ground from the second floor clark also overlooked the directions for the “twinkling” holiday lights and was unable to change them from the constant on position 5 often has trouble organizing activities clark forgets to bring the saw necessary to cut down the tree on the family christmas tree trip and also manages to freeze most of his daughter’s body by leading them through massive snow and freezing temperatures without adequate preparation his son rusty spends most of the time during the christmas light installation retrieving items from various locations or untangling the jumbled mess of string lights 6 often avoids dislikes or does not want to do things that take a lot of mental effort for a long period of time such as schoolwork or homework7 often loses things needed for tasks and activities eg toys school assignments pencils books or tools8 is often easily distracted clark asks his wife about his motherinlaw waxing her lip during a serious conversation about holiday tension he becomes trapped in the attic and becomes distracted by the case of home movies he found while searching for warm clothing he proceeds to watch the movies instead of trying to find a way out of the attic 9 often forgetful in daily activities clark is easily distracted and forgets basic activities or the involvement of others some symptoms that cause impairment were present before age 7 years there has to be an onset of symptoms prior to 7 years old but a diagnosis can occur much later unable to find medical history confirming childhood diagnosis but this could be due to the lack of information regarding adhd prior to 1970 some impairment from the symptoms is present in two or more settings eg at schoolwork and at home clark’s behavioral problems are consistent at both home and work with home being his largest source of symptomatic display there must be clear evidence of significant impairment in social school or work functioning clark displays inappropriate affect and displays attentional deficits at work and home the symptoms do not happen only during the course of a pervasive developmental disorder schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder the symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder eg mood disorder anxiety disorder dissociative disorder or a personality disorder clark’s does not demonstrate the symptoms associated with other disorders to warrant a full diagnosis of mood disorder anxiety disorder dissociative disorder or personality disorder he does present with ocd like symptoms and should be observed to assure an accurate diagnosis accuracy of portrayal clark’s adhd oriented behavior traits are consistent over the course of each movie his excessive talking trouble organizing activities trouble staying focused when spoken to directly and forgetfulness of daily activities are just a few of the direct adhd symptoms that clark displays however he does not consistently display the passiveness normally associated with inattentive adhd clark is compliant and passive during some events yet he is also prone to outbursts and demonstrates a quick temper adhd shows a high comorbidity with oppositional defiant disorder odd and conduct disorder cd but clark’s temper and outbursts are more likely caused by environmental and psychological factors thereby presenting an inaccuracy in the portrayal the average viewer watching clark griswold may consider his behaviors are more consistent with obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd clark displays an inability to curb impulses and recurrent thoughts and is prone to act according to his own volition regardless of the outcome on others although these attributes illustrate ocd they are just a few of the many symptoms of adhd that clark exhibits treatment the best course of treatment should begin with a structured or semistructured clinical interview to obtain clark’s family and medical history and pervasive symptoms pertaining to adhd and comorbid disorders empirically supported treatment includes stimulant medication to relieve core symptoms fdaapproved medications are useful for reducing physical symptoms specifically adhd responds best to stimulant medications such as ritalin cylert and dexedrine due to the severity and inability to predict side effect occurrence from cylert the better pharmaceutical choice is either methylphenidate ritalin or destroamphetamine sulfate dexedrine for clark’s symptoms potential stimulant medication side effects include insomnia decreased appetite and potential dependence dosage is prescribed based on patient age weight and medical history clark should begin with the lowest possible dosage and gradually increase prescription strength only at the advice of a therapist or doctor behavior therapy is preferred as the primary treatment choice in conjunction with pharmacotherapy and can be useful for improving social skills modifying behavioral deficits and reducing aggression additionally family support methods are vital to effective treatment plans generalized anxiety disorder name piglet source the world of pooh by a a milne books 1954 background information piglet is a young male pig and winnie the pooh’s friend since he is portrayed as a baby he is probably in the age range of 03 years old piglet does not have a job and his family history is unknown he does not have any physical health problems but he displays characteristics of anxiety and nervousness he stutters quite a bit and he is fearful of wind and darkness piglet also does not like bees or woozles which are creatures that piglet has not yet seen piglet lives in the hundred acre wood with pooh and all of the other winnie the pooh characters he lives in a house in a large beech tree with a sign outside that says “tresspassers w” which to piglet means his grandfather lived there and his name was “tresspassers william” piglet’s goals are to become brave not so timid and to catch a heffalump a creature that resembles an elephant description of the problem piglet is a very timid piglet he shows characteristics of anxiety and he stutters he thinks of how any situation can go wrong and he argues with himself about what he should do if a situation does go wrong for example while trying to catch a heffalump piglet thinks to himself how he can fake a headache so he will not have to face one of these creatures in case it is fierce then he thinks to himself that if he fakes a headache he will be stuck in bed all morning so he does not know what to do these are the types of scenarios that make him anxious he has thoughts that he creates that jump from one bad scenario to another piglet also shakes and blushes his ears twitch when he is scared or nervous which is often he is usually very flustered diagnosis the diagnosis that would best fit piglet is generalized anxiety disorder 30002 in children to be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder only one of these symptoms must be present 1restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge 2 being easily fatigued 3 difficulty concentrating or mind going blank 4 irritability 5 muscle tension 6 sleep disturbance difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless unsatisfying sleeppiglet definitely shows signs of restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge he also has difficulty concentrating his thoughts jump from one bad scenario to another excessive anxiety and worry apprehensive expectation occurring more days for at least six months about a number of events or activities such as work or school performance piglet has had anxiety problems his whole life as far as we know from the books he definitely has probably had anxiety problems for more than six months the person finds it difficult to control their worry piglet cannot control his worry which is why he struggles with trying to be brave he manages to live with his worry and anxiety but the thoughts are still there and he voices his worry to his friends an unrealistic fear or worry especially in new or unfamiliar situations piglet is afraid of the dark and wind he has an unrealistic fear of heffalumps and woozles the focus of the anxiety and worry is not confined to features of an axis i disorder eg the anxiety or worry is not about having a panic attack as in panic disorder being embarrassed in public as in social phobia being contaminated as in obsessivecompulsive disorder being away from home or close relatives as in separation anxiety disorder gaining weight as in anorexia nervosa having multiple physical complaints as in somatization disorder or having a serious illness as in hypochondriasis and the anxiety and worry do not occur exclusively during posttraumatic stress disorder piglet anxiety and worry are not due to any of the above features the anxiety worry and physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning piglet’s anxiety and worry does cause him clinically significant distress because he is always worrying about or is afraid of something he shows distress from his anxiety the disturbance is not due to the direct psychological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition eg hyperthyroidism and does not occur exclusively during a mood disorder a psychotic disorder or a pervasive developmental disorder piglet does not use drugs nor does he suffer from any physical medical conditions and he does not have any of the above disorders accuracy of portrayal the average person reading the world of pooh by a a milne would be exposed to an accurate portrayal of generalized anxiety disorder in piglet piglet trembles twitches and is shaky piglet also has exaggerated startle responses to things that scare him he also shows symptoms of autonomic hyperarousal like rapid heart rate and shortness of breath when piglet is in stressful conditions his anxiety levels tend to elevate and worsen this is typical of young people with generalized anxiety disorder children with this disorder may also show signs of being unsure of themselves the book accurately portrays generalized anxiety disorder in piglet treatment in treating piglet one would try to avoid medicines since he is a child and some of the side effects of certain medications can be suicidal thoughts in children starting out treating piglet with cognitive behavioral therapy cbt would be optimal cbt could help piglet recognize his negative thoughts and try to change his thoughts to more positive thoughts that are more realistic it would also help piglet with relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises that could help him learn to relax better in stressful situations that cause anxiety for him after participating in the behavioral therapy and learning relaxation techniques piglet could better handle and manage his own anxiety this could lead to a much happier comfortable and positive life his quality of life would be better after the treatment gender identity disorder name brandon teena teena ray brandon source boys don’t cry movie 1999 background information brandon teena is an adolescentcaucasian female who grew up in lincoln nebraska teena prefers to live her life as a male she does not currently appear to have a stable and persistent means of income or employment teena steals because of her low social economic status and non effort to obtain an occupation her delinquent activity has led her to attain a juvenile record before she has reached the age of 21 although the whereabouts of her mother is unknown there seems to be a distant to an almost nonexistent relationship between her and her mother her father died before she was born so there is absent fathering in her life from the beginning of her years she lives with her cousin from time to time in a trailer home yet her cousin does not support the trouble she gets into with the locals and the law her cousin and presumably other family members do not except her transgender choice to act as a male either teena mainly lives out of her travel bag with no stable consistent place to call home there doesn’t seem to be any health concerns there is also no evidence that there is any family mental history as well brandon teena who‘s legal name is teena brandon has always looked like a girl yet reported that she had always felt as guy cutting her hair short wrapping up her breasts and wearing a fake penis has in fact resembled her as looking as a male her past does not show any previous drug or alcoholic abuse however recently she has been introduced to a selected few of drugs such as marijuana with a group of new friends in falls city nebraska teena’s weakness appears to be females her goal is to have a surgical procedure to change her female sex characteristics description of the problem teena currently displays symptoms that indicate that she does indeed reject her identity as being a female physically she seems to have emotional symptoms especially when someone may mention that she is a girl and not a boy her cousin continued to tell her that she was a girl that she needs to leave the girls alone and that she needs to accept the fact that she is a lesbian although teena knows that she is physically not a male she denies being a lesbian or homosexual teena cross dresses and wears a fake penis and socks in her pants in order to portray body types like a male she denies having sexual attributes such as a having a menstruation and tries to hide all of her sexual characteristics from others she will claim to be a hermaphrodite before she claims to be a female teena has not ever had sexual intercourse with a male and has resisted from being touched any areas by her genitals from any of her sexual partners teena could pass for a male fairly easily with a short hair cut like a guy her age male stature and her cross dressing efforts diagnosis the diagnosis for teena brandon that seems to fit appropriately is gender identity disorder in adolescents or adults 30285 a in adolescents and adults the disturbance is manifested by symptoms such as a stated desire to be the opposite sex frequent dressing as the opposite sex desire to live or be treated as the opposite sex or the conviction that he or she has the typical feelings and reactions of the opposite sex teena acted like a male and desired to be treated like a male by everyone teena cross dressed to look like a normal guy her age would as well she was also very attractive to girls b persistent discomfort with his or her sex or sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of their sex in adolescents and adults the disturbance is manifested by symptoms such as preoccupation with getting rid of primary and secondary sex characteristics eg request for hormones surgery or other procedures to physically alter sexual characteristics to simulate the other sex or belief that he or she was born the wrong sex teena desired to change her sexual characteristics through surgical procedures she wrapped her breasts down in order to flatten them and wore a counterfeit penis in her underwear c the disturbance is not concurrent with a physical intersex condition even though teena claimed that she was a hermaphrodite she was full characterized and constructed as a female physically and biologically d the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning specify if for sexually mature individuals sexually attracted to males sexually attracted to females sexually attracted to both sexually attracted to neither teena was a part of the low social economic status population and also did not indicate a means of trying to obtain an occupation while she continued to steal things teena seemed to have a hard time getting along with everyone except for her female partners accuracy of portrayal the average person watching this movie would see a reasonably accurate portrayal of the onset of gender identity disorder especially since teena brandon denies her gender and sexual characteristics as well as being a homosexual in any part of the movie the movie helps the portrayal of gender identity disorder in a significant way by giving good examples of all the symptoms of gender identity disorder because the movie portrayed true events of someone’s life most symptoms did seem neither inaccurate nor exaggerated teena fits the adult presentation of gender identity disorder because of her persistent frustration of her biological sex she passed as the opposite sex by cross dressing and abstained from touching or letting female partners touching her genitalia one may think that parental relationships were being mislabeled in the movie about gender identity disorder because the only whereabouts that were known about the parents were mentioned very briefly the course of the disorder was also mislabeled because nothing about her childhood was revealed during the movie if her childhood was identified during the movie then gender dyshoria would have been prevalent in her life because research shows that children with gender dysphoria that persists into adulthood results in gender identity disorder teena showed to have constant discomfort with her sex as being a female which fits into the general descriptive feature of gender identity disorder the reason why majority of people friends and family of teena did not accept her sexual orientation is because there is a 1 in 100000 occurrence opposed to 1 in 30000 in men and men are more accepted than women throughout all of the details and information that was made available in the movie the movie portrayed gender identity disorder appropriately treatment there are empirical studies that help support treatments for people who portray gender identity disorder psychotherapy would have been more helpful for teena if her disorder was identified earlier however psychotherapy can still help teena cope with her biological sex and behavioral patterns associated with the roles of her biological determined sex it may reduce teena’s transsexual behavior in a very subtle way but probably not as much because her disorder was not caught in the beginning another treatment that could help teena would be hormonal therapy of surgical procedure s before having any surgical procedures teena may be given hormonal therapy in order to prevent undesired sex characteristics of the unwanted opposite sex various behavior therapies could help teena by helping her to modify her behavior towards the sex she wants to be triadic therapy may help teena as well this therapy includes three differ elements living as the desired gender sex reassignment therapy and hormone therapy however she would not have to include all of these elements into her therapy name dil source the crying game movie 1992 background information dil is a young midtwenties biracial male that prefers to live his life as a female dil works as a hairdresser at a salon during the day and performs as a nightclub singer at night the bar that dil performs at is called “the metro” the metro is a gay bar filled with lesbians gays and transsexuals most of the performers at the metro are transsexual males dil states in the movie that she has a blood condition that causes her to grow weak there are several medications that she has to take for this condition my interpretation is the blood disorder she is speaking of is hivaids dil does not have any family close to her the closest most stable relationship in her life is the bartender at the metro dil is currently single because the love of her life was killed when he was a soldier in ireland dil suffers from depression and loneliness and uses alcohol to cope she also lives a very promiscuous lifestyle in search of love and acceptance dil’s weakness is men and she is often abused and manipulated by the men that she “loves” description of the problem dil displays symptoms that she wants to be perceived as a female although she still has a penis she wants others to perceive and treat her like a female if a man that she potentially wants to date or “mess around with” does not perceive her as a female she gets angry however she also blames the man if he does not recognize that she was born a male at first dil would refuse to have sex with jimmy instead she preferred to perform oral sex on jimmy this was in an effort to keep him from seeing her penis one night after they had been drinking dil decided to disrobe and show jimmy her penis jimmy was shocked and he hit her then he proceeded to vomit in the bathroom this further sent dil believing he would never love and accept her for who she was dil seemed to get really emotional when jimmy threatened to leave her and refused to stay with her or show any type of affection toward her the man dil refers to as her true love did know that she was born a male and he accepted her for who she was diagnosis the appropriate diagnosis for dil is gender identity disorder in adolescents or adults 30285 a in adolescents and adults the disturbance is manifested by symptoms such as a stated desire to be the opposite sex frequent dressing as the opposite sex desire to live or be treated as the opposite sex or the conviction that he or she has the typical feelings and reactions of the opposite sex dil was an adult male that chose to live his life as a female dil often stated that she was a lady and wanted to be treated as such mostly everyone around dil except jimmy knew that she was born a male however the still called her a woman and treated her like a woman dil dressed talked walked and acted like a woman dil was a very emotional person and some may perceive that as acting like a woman most men would view dil as a very attractive woman b persistent discomfort with his or her sex or sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of their sex in adolescents and adults the disturbance is manifested by symptoms such as preoccupation with getting rid of primary and secondary sex characteristics eg request for hormones surgery or other procedures to physically alter sexual characteristics to simulate the other sex or belief that he or she was born the wrong sex dil did not speak of wanting to have surgery to change sexes however she never went out without a padded dress or bra to make the illusion that there were breasts there c the disturbance is not concurrent with a physical intersex condition dil was not a hermaphrodite he was simply born male and wanted to live his life as a woman he did not state that he wanted to have surgery to change his genitals but he did want others to view him as a female d the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning specify if for sexually mature individuals sexually attracted to males sexually attracted to females sexually attracted to both sexually attracted to neither dil lived in what seemed to be a lowincome part of town however she worked as a hairdresser so she was able to pay her bills she seemed to be liked by others such as her coworkers and people at the bar men especially found her very attractive and likeable however some men often took advantage of her low selfesteem and would physically abuse her dil was attracted to only males especially males that told her they loved and cared about her accuracy of portrayal the average person watching this film would not have guessed that dil was born a male they would have just viewed her as an attractive woman in the beginning of the movie most men could probably identify with the main character in being unaware that dil was not a born female first of all there are many men that look for the large adam’s apple first and if they do not see it they assume that the female was born female dil did not have a large adam’s apple or a deep voice however she did have very large hands and feet people watching this movie could learn that not everyone that has gender identity disorder or feels that they were born in the wrong body wants to have surgery some choose not to undergo surgery and hormones and all of these things because of the side effects others choose not to have surgery because they are comfortable living as the opposite sex without making surgical changes dil was a person that was comfortable living as a female without seeking out surgery the actor in this film definitely performed an accurate portrayal of gender identity disorder the emotion that was expressed throughout the film that dil experienced seemed genuine anytime she felt jealous scared or rejected that is when she would either seek attention from men or turn to alcohol treatment if i were a mental health professional and dil walked into my office i would first gather all of the proper background information and medical history and then proceed accordingly one of the treatments for gender identity disorder is hormones and surgery but i do not think that would be a good fit for dil because she has not expressed any interest in changing her biological sexual identity instead i would recommend psychotherapy for dil i think dil would benefit from psychotherapy because it would help her with gather and implement coping mechanisms to deal with her sexual identity also empirical evidence supports that dil would have better benefitted from psychotherapy if it was administered early in life but i think that she could still benefit from psychotherapy as an adult the main purpose of psychotherapy in gender identity disorder patients is to help them cope with their biologically determined sex and reinforce the behavioral patterns associated with those roles however with dil the approach may be different because the role she is comfortable in is the role of the female so as a professional i would focus more on making her more comfortable with her biology and not trying to change her into becoming a male transvestic fetishisim name glen source glen or glenda movie 1953 background information glen is a heterosexual caucasian male and presumably in his late twenties he appears to be in good physical heath appropriate weight for stature and is a smoker glen was raised by his biological parents and has one younger sister according to glen his relationship with his father was strained glen’s father wanted a son that was interested in sports and who would be a great athlete none of which glen was

been engaged to be married for 1 year to his fiancée barbara glen and barbara have a healthly relationship displaying respect open communication and expressions of affection glen has no history of

sex makes him happy and more comfortable in his environment while living at home he fulfills this desire by wearing his sister’s clothing when none of his family members are at home in order to

heterosexual male recurrent intense sexually arousing fantasies sexual urges or behaviors involving crossdressing glen did not meet criteria for transvestic fetishisim he exhibits symptoms more associated with being a transvestite or crossdresser he exhibited no recurrent intense sexually arousing fantasies sexual urges or behaviors in addition to his crossdressing b the fantasies sexual urges or behaviors cause significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning it involves using nonliving objects to obtain sexual arousal glen’s crossdressing created distress within himself and his relationship with barbara she began to see signs of difficulty or stress in glen which create trust issue for her glen experiences extreme stress about the idea of telling barbara and possible losing her because she could not understand his obsession accuracy of portrayal glen did not meet criteria for transvestic fetishisim the movie portrayed an individual who did meet criteria for crossdressing a desired to wear clothing of the opposite gender in some instances to relieve stress brought about by daily encounters the essential feature of transvestic fetishisim is defined as recurrent intense sexually arousing fantasies sexual urges or behaviors involving crossdressing glen did not exhibit any sexual urges or sexual fantasies while engaging in crossdressing he expressed his desire to crossdress was only for comfort and happiness within his environment this movie did not address any of the aforementioned criteria in regards to transvestic fetishisim treatment there is no empirically supported treatment for transvestic fetishism two types of therapy have been utilized in an effort to treat this disorder aversion therapy involving electrical shock and orgasmic reorientation an attempt to help individuals learn to respond sexually to generally acceptable stimuli both of these treatments were developed when little was known about the disorder and when it was less accepted today there is less focus on treatment of the disorder and more encouragement for societal acceptance in cases where individuals have come in for treatment it is mainly due to others such as spouses and or family members requesting they seek treatment prognosis for this disorder is poor due to the fact that most individuals with this disorder do not want to change treatment that is demanded by others such as one’s spouse or family members is almost always not successful posttraumatic stress disorder name nick nicolas source the deer hunter

see that they are all shocked in battle vietnamese soldiers attack them from all directions after a couple of days all three of them are taken captive in vietnam while captive nick michael and steven are forced to play russian roulette while their captors gambling on who will or will not blow out his brain russian roulette is a lethal game in which one bullet is placed in a revolver and participants captives here spin the cylinder place the muzzle against their head and pull the trigger this is a horrifying moment for nick and his friends steven who is a newly married groom shows extreme symptoms of stress and anxiety nick visibly disintegrates under the abuse and torture of their captors while michael refuses to capitulate michael plans to free himself and his two other friends by requesting a three bullet russian roulette game from his captors he manages to kill the captors and runs away with nick and steven an american helicopter shows up and transports nick to army hospital while michael and steven wait for the next helicopter description of the problem while nick is in the u s army hospital inside vietnam he displays mild symptoms of anxiety insomnia lack of appetite and anxiety are among the major symptoms he displays when a nurse comes and talks to him he keeps staring at people who are brought to the hospital and does not talk to anyone after about a month he leaves the hospital and starts to have more severe symptoms of anger especially when he is reminded of his time in vietnam he completely forgets that he has a fiancée or friends he does not call his friends to see if they are still alive and seems detached from his social environment he has a sense of a foreshortened future because he does not have a plan to go back home or do anything while he is in u s camp in vietnam nick is very busy with his thoughts and does not communicate with his surroundings social impairment is vivid at this point he accidently visits a bar in that town where people gamble on playing russian roulette as soon as he enters the bar he starts to have intrusive distressing recollections of the time when he was captive and forced to play this game he experiences a high level of anxiety and anger as he is watching a candidate place a revolver to his head nick grabs the revolver and passionately places it to his head and pulls the trigger he disrupts the game and the gamblers kick him out however on the next day as he is walking down a street he reaches the same bar he goes inside and sits in one of the empty seats designated for a russian roulette player michael who was more emotionally stable than steven and nick shows only very mild symptoms of anxiety and goes back home his friends and family welcome him but he goes back to vietnam to bring nick home he meets nick however nick does not show any emotion to him so michael tries to play russian roulette with him in that bar to perhaps unfreeze nick’s memory nick starts to communicate with michael a little however nick dies when he pulls the trigger in front of michael diagnosis based on the observed symptoms the diagnosis for nick fits well with posttraumatic stress disorder 30981 a the person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the following have been present1 the person experienced witnessed or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others2 the persons response involved intense fear helplessness or horror nick’s symptoms certainly meet above characteristics as nick experienced and witnessed an event in vietnam which he was threatened to death by the russian roulette game he has intense fear and feelings of hopelessness while being captive in vietnam background information b the traumatic event is persistently reexperienced in one or more of the following ways1 recurrent and intrusive distressing recollections of the event including images thoughts or perceptions note in young children repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the trauma are expressed2 recurrent distressing dreams of the event note in children there may be frightening dreams without recognizable content3 acting or feeling as if the traumatic event were recurring includes a sense of reliving the experience illusions hallucinations and dissociative flashback episodes including those that occur upon awakening or when intoxicated note in young children traumaspecific reenactment may occur4 intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event5 physiological reactivity on exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event nick reexperienced very intense psychological distress when he observed people who were gambling on players playing russian roulette in a bar in there he acted as if he was a captive in vietnam and therefore took the gun from one of the players and after he pointed the gun toward his head pulled the trigger so he was exposed to external cues which symbolized an aspect of the traumatic event in vietnam therefore he qualifies for more than one of above conditions 3 4 and 5 c persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness not present before the trauma as indicated by three or more of the following efforts to avoid thoughts feelings or conversations associated with the trauma efforts to avoid activities places or people that arouse recollections of the trauma inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities feeling of detachment or estrangement from others restricted range of affect eg unable to have loving feelingssense of a foreshortened future eg does not expect to have a career marriage children or a normal life spanas it was mentioned in the background information nick showed no interest in any activity or in friendships he was certainly detached from his social environment and also had no feelings of love when his friend michael showed up to take nick back home nick did not show any interest and was not passionate about his fiancé therefore he met four of above conditions 4 5 6 and 7 d persistent symptoms of increased arousal not present before the trauma as indicated by two or more of the following difficulty falling or staying asleep irritability or outbursts of anger difficulty concentrating hypervigilance exaggerated startle response nick clearly shows outburst of anger in several scenes of the movie he also had difficulty concentrating when his friend michael tried to remind him of his fiancé and home unfortunately it was not shown in the movie whether nick has difficulty sleeping but his condition meets above criteria 2 and 3 e duration of the disturbance symptoms in criteria b c and d is more than one month nick had above symptoms for more than one month f the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning nick’s symptoms reveal an intense social impairment as well impairment in his interpersonal relationship therefore his symptoms meet this criterion nick’s condition is a representation of an acute ptsd accuracy of portrayal nick’s symptoms were well demonstrated to portray post traumatic stress disorder ptsd nick experienced intense and horrifying moments in vietnam in which he was threatened with death through russian roulette he observed and watched other prisoners die therefore the war portrayed an accurate condition which could be the cause of ptsd however this movie showed nick revisit the bar while he is suffering from ptsd and playing russian roulette over and over again although nick showed intense anger toward this game ptsd patients mostly avoid experiences that remind them of their stressful event therefore this part of the movie does not accurately resemble the condition of a ptsd patient while all other symptoms are well matched with ptsd overall there was an accurate portrayal of a person’s descent into ptsd treatment ptsd is highly comorbid with other anxiety problems and as such it would be beneficial to control the anxiety before starting other treatments therefore the primary treatment action for nick would be to start a low dosage of an anti anxiety medication such as escitalopram lexapro after a full medical examination once pharmaceutical treatment begins the next level of treatment for nick would be prolonged exposure pe therapy this therapy will help nick to decrease distress about his trauma and approach traumarelated thoughts feelings and situations that he is avoiding due to the distress in the first part of prolonged exposure therapy nick needs to be educated about his disorder and common trauma reactions this would allow nick to learn and become more familiar about his symptoms and better understand treatment goal and process the second part of the treatment is to train nick how to have long breath and relax one of the symptoms of ptsd especially in nick’s case is abnormal breathing habits when the patient is scared or anxious this part of treatment will help nick to overcome his distress by breathing differently real world exposure practice is the third part of this treatment in which nick is exposed to russian roulette game without any bullets over and over again such in vivo exposure helps nick’s trauma related distress to lessen over time in the last part of prolonged exposure therapy therapist should talk to nick while he is exposed to russian roulette game this helps to unfreeze nick’s memory and to let him communicate about his experience and memories with therapist and not being afraid of his memories talking through the trauma can also help therapist to identify nick’s negative thoughts about past event and help to modify his negative thoughts allowing him to make sense of what happened and have fewer negative thoughts about the trauma family therapy is also recommended for nick since he no longer seeks any friendship and does not have any emotions for his fiancée family therapy can help the nick’s friends and fiancée understand what they are going through and help them work through relationship schizophrenia name nina sayers source black swan movie 2010 background information nina sayers is a caucasian female who is presumed to be in her early to middle twenties although her actual age is unknown she currently works as a ballerina in a new york city ballet company whose name is undisclosed although there are not any known distinct physical illnesses abnormalities disorders or disadvantages currently within sayers there are observable health concerns the patient is visibly underweight and has serious cuts bruises and other wounds on her feet although both of these concerns can be attributed to her career as a dancer however there are also various lesions and abrasions throughout the surface of sayers’ body which cannot be attributed to anything in her current daily environment it is speculated that these lesions could be selfinflicted sayers currently lives by choice with her mother her mother although not diagnosed has observable generalized anxiety disorder symptoms as well as some neurotic personality traits it is also observed that the mother displays a very rich sense of control over sayers’ life such as her scheduling room design personal decisions etc sayers appears to not have very many if any close friends or relatives outside of her mother it is undisclosed whether or not sayers has had any contact with her biological father it is assumed that he does not actively participate in her life until recently there was not any reported drug or alcohol history however as of late she has reported experimenting with ecstasy a derivative of mdma as well as engaging in small amounts of social drinking her current goal is to become the principle dancer of her current ballet company most of her daily activities are related to improving her performance as a dancer description of the problem sayers currently displays a whole host of symptoms that could be indication of several disorders the lesions and abrasions as aforementioned fit the description of selfmutilation however sayers denies ever abusing herself and frequently reports not knowing how the lesions and abrasions appeared on her body in the first place sayers often suffers from both visual and audio hallucinations these hallucinations include items such as seeing feathers physically protrude from her skin seeing and hearing paintings laughing at her having conversations and encounters with people that never took place and peeling off pieces of her own skin that are obviously still in tact among many other hallucinations she is also currently under some delusions as well she believes that another one of her codancers is trying to take her starring role in the next upcoming production from her when there is not any evidence to support such a claim she also believes that this codancer is sleeping with the program director when there is no evidence to support this claim either in general sayers is very convinced that various people are intentionally trying to take this acclaimed dancing role from her or as she refers to it her chance to be “perfect” diagnosis the diagnosis for sayers that seems to fit appropriately is schizophrenia paranoid type 29530 to be diagnosed with schizophrenia two or more of the following characteristics must be present1 delusions2 hallucinations3 disorganized speech4 grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior5 negative symptoms ie affective flattening alogia or avolition sayers definitely has both the first and second characteristics of delusions and hallucinations as described in the section of “description of the problem”for a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance one or more major areas of functioning such as work interpersonal relations or selfcare are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset the delusions and hallucinations have made both sayers’ work and personal life dysfunctional she has been late for rehearsals and has caused a great amount of interpersonal disturbance amongst her coworkers continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months this 6month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms that meet criterion a and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms the hallucinations of skin peeling and the delusion of denial of having part of her own lesions and abrasions have been present with sayers for the majority of her life during the last one to two month period is when her visual and auditory hallucinations have become more frequent it is also during the last one to two month period that the persecutory delusion of having her role taken from her has become prominent it is unknown if she has suffered from other persecutory delusions previously schizoaffective disorder and mood disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1 no major depressive manic or mixed episodes have occurred concurrentlywith the activephase symptoms or 2 if mood episodes have occurred during activephasesymptoms their total duration has been brief relative to the duration of the active and residual periods during observation sayers has not met any criteria that would indicate any of the mood disorders her persistent amount of dance practice may signify a possible manic episode but since she has always spent a great deal of time practicing it appears as if it is too consistent to be considered an episode therefore disqualifying her from any mood disorders the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition as previously stated there is not any known distinct physical illnesses abnormalities disorders or disadvantages currently within sayers that would explain her schizophrenic symptoms she did not have any drug history until recently but her symptoms were present long before her intake of any substance if there is a history of autistic disorder or another pervasive developmental disorder the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present for at least a month there is no history of either of the above listed disorders present in sayers to fit the diagnostic criteria for 29530 paranoid type the following criteria are met preoccupation with one or more delusions or frequent auditory hallucinations sayers is completely preoccupied by her persistent tactile visual and auditory hallucinations she is also completely preoccupied with her delusion of someone trying to take her role from her none of the following are prominent disorganized speech disorganized or catatonic behavior or flat or inappropriate affect sayers displays none of the above listed behaviors accuracy of portrayal the average person watching this movie would see a reasonably accurate portrayal of the onset of paranoid schizophrenia especially since nina sayers is in the perfect age range for onset but not necessarily the daily experience after onset of course the movie overdramatized a lot of the symptoms that the average schizophrenic would experience but not to the point that the symptoms were so exaggerated that to make the case that she was schizophrenic was invalid if one were to make an assessment in fact this movie actually somewhat helps the portrayal of schizophrenia in the media as many movies and television shows give examples of the symptoms of dissociative disorder as evidence of schizophrenia which are totally inaccurate and confuse the audience as to what schizophrenia actually is although symptoms would not occur as rapidly as they do in nina sayers in most common cases of schizophrenia it is plausible therefore black swan is a decent portrayal of a person’s descent into paranoid schizophrenia treatment to treat sayers after a full medical examination it would be best to immediately start her on a midlevel dosage of an antipsychotic such as vesprin most people with schizophrenia respond very well to current medication in comparison to people with other axis i disorders after pharmaceutical treatment begins and an appropriate dosage has been stabilized it would be best to start sayers and her mother into family therapy as to educate and help both of them find ways to cope with this disorder and to help sayers’ mother be more tolerant and understanding of sayers’ symptoms social skill training would also be beneficial to sayers because as previously stated she has no close friends or any type of social support outside of her mother social skill training would also help sayers interact more efficiently with the other people who work at the dance company lessening interpersonal disturbances caused by her disorder pathological gambling name geoffrey chaucer aka chaucer source a knight’s tale movie 2001 background information geoffrey chaucer is a male in his late 20’s to early 30’s he is in good health and with no serious illnesses we have no information from this movie about his past this includes no information about his parents or where he is from he announces that he is a writer for hire he says that he has written a few poems and is known for his book “the book of the duchess” during the time of the movie he acts as a writer and a herald for william he seems to have no social ties to his past other than the people who have collected his debts during the movie he does start to gain close relationships with the four people he is traveling and working with there is no evidence that he has any other vices such as drinking or drug problems throughout the movie he has difficulty dealing with his gambling urges and knowing when to stop description of the problem chaucer starts the story in a very depressed mood he is first introduced to us while he walks completely naked down a trail he comes upon a group of men along the road he then lies about how he has lost all of his possessions he says that he had been robbed in a sense rather than that he had lost of his possessions to his gambling problem to get passage to the next city he blackmails the group he blackmails them by uncovering that the group had lied about their identities and saw that they would need forged documents that he could provide if they gave him money after forging the documents chaucer presented them for authentication and had them accepted the group offers chaucer the job of being a herald which he accepts at the same time though he is very preoccupied with watching people gambling along the alleyway he then immediately cuts off is conversation with william to go and gamble this leads him to be in the same position where we had first seen naked and with a large gambling debt when chaucer is unable to pay for his debts he calls on william to get him out of the bad situation william is given the choice of paying off chaucer’s debt or let his new friend pay for it from his hide chaucer admits after this that he has a problem with gambling diagnosis based on the dsmivtr criteria chaucer fits at least eight of the ten maladaptive behaviors listed a persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behavior as indicated by five or more of the following 1 is preoccupied with gambling eg preoccupied with reliving past gambling experiences handicapping or planning the next venture or thinking of ways to get money with which to gamblewhen chaucer is given a small amount of money he immediately see people gambling and is fixated his attention on them he then says “i must see a man about a dog” this is a cover up so that he can leave to go gamble the little cash that he had just received 2 needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement  3 has repeated unsuccessful efforts to control cut back or stop gambling chaucer is found walking naked after losing all his possessions to gambling in the last town he then gambles away what little money he was given in the next town 4 is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling 5 gambles as a way of escaping from problems or of relieving a dysphoric mood eg feelings of helplessness guilt anxiety depressionchaucer is in a depressed state trudging the slow weary depressing yet determined walk of a man and then prays to his god to get him out of his tribulations then he gambles at the first opportunity to escape his current living style 6 after losing money gambling often returns another day to get even chasing ones losseshe had lost everything but in the next town he bet again to try to win what he lost earlier 7 lies to family members therapist or others to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling chaucer when asked if he had been robbed stated that he had taken an involuntary vow of poverty this is rather than saying that he had lost all of it gambling 8 has committed illegal acts such as forgery fraud theft or embezzlement to finance gambling chaucer knowingly forges patents of nobility for the group to be able to compete in tournaments 9 has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship job or educational or career opportunity because of gambling chaucer was a herald and his gambling debt he pushed off on his newly found friends almost lost him this position and their friendship 10 relies on others to provide money to relieve a desperate financial situation caused by gambling chaucer loses all his positions again and tells the collectors that william can pay for his debt that he has made while gambling later william does come and wipe out the debt b the gambling behavior is not better accounted for by a manic episode accuracy of portrayal the portrayal of chaucer struggling with gambling is only a small side story with that said it is still easy to tell that he has a problem with his ability to control his pathological gambling it is demonstrated how it is affecting him and his friends in negative ways he even goes on later in the movie to admit to his friends that he does have a gambling problem the only flaw in the accuracy of portrayal is that once he admits to the group that he has a problem it is never a problem again in the movie overall this is an accurate portrayal of pathological gambling treatment the treatment for chaucer’s pathological gambling is already taking place during the movie he makes a great first step in admitting to his friends that he does have a problem and that he needed help after his admission he does not have any more problems with gambling a long term goal would be to identify why he has the urge to gamble in the first place that is because gambling is just the symptom of an underlining problem i would look at handling his depression his depression is seen only shortly but with the high comorbidity of pathological gambling and depression it is important to examine it aversion therapy can be used to treat his urges to gamble this is done by putting him into a condition that he would usually gamble but also exposing him to something that would cause him discomfort this is to learn self control and to overcome the illusion that they will win the next time he should not gamble again for any reason he should also look for support groups like gamblers anonymous to help him over his urges delusional disorder name marshal edward

disorder diagnosis the diagnosis for edward daniels is delusional disorder mix type 2971nonbizarre delusions for at least one month teddy experiences nonbizarre delusions over the course of two years the delusions are not due to schizoaffective disorder nor mood disorder he does not have an alcohol dependency nor is he chronically depressed criterion a for schizophrenia has never been met teddy does not show flat inappropriate affect he is very sociable and his delusions are not bizarre apart from the impact of the delusion s or its ramifications functioning is not markedly impaired and

duration has been brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods teddy is generally in a good mood he is not depressed or anxious he is always looking forward to catching new hints about rachel he gets angry when people refuse to give him want he thinks he needs such as case files for patients in the mental hospital e the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition teddy does smoke and drink however he does not have negative episodes which develop from the substance abuse but not alcohol dependence he takes medications which help his migraines to go away specify type mixed typei delusions characteristic of more than one type grandiose type delusions which are inflated worth power knowledge identity or special relationship to a deity or famous personi teddy believes that he is a valued marshal with specialized privileges to the mental hospital he feels that people should obey his requests persecutory type delusions that the person or someone to whom the person is close is being malevolently treated in some wayi teddy feels that the employees of the mental institution are trying to commit him at a patient he feels that they are controlling him by giving him special medications other than simple pain killers teddy is also convinced that the cigarettes the institution provides are laced with drugs to cause him to become powerless accuracy of portrayal the portrayal of delusional disorder was accurate throughout the film it was not apparent until the end of the film that he was suffering from a disorder and not an actual investigator the delusions were believable to those who do not have a complete understanding of psychology and psychotic disorders treatment the treatment psychiatrist used in the film was ultimately performing the lobotomy lobotomies were accepted in the fifties as reasonable treatments for psychotic disorders in current treatment procedures lobotomies are unethical the lobotomy procedure is the use of an ice pick type probe which is inserted through the eye in order to dismantle the brain this develops a calming effect on the patient recent treatment used for delusional disorder would include both medications and psychotherapy medicinal treatments may involve antipsychotics and antidepressants such as ssri and clomipramine psychotherapy treatments involve supportive therapy and cognitive therapy the treatment used for patients must be individualized the treatment for andrew laeddis should consist of cognitive therapy combined with medication anorexia nervosa name trevor reznik source the machinist movie 2004 background information trevor renik is a middle aged male of euroasian decent trevor is a bluecollar worker trevor works for a company national machine as a welder trevor’s work environment is not a positive or friendly one trevor’s age and family history are not known through the film trevor reznik is not a healthy individual he smokes cigarettes he does not sleep he does not eat at all and consumes large amount of caffeine trevor states he does not drink frequently but is seen drinking throughout the film trevor is not seen eating once throughout the film nor does he engage in any physical exercise trevor is socially withdrawn and does not have any close friends or family members the interactions with women in the beginning of the film indicate that trevor is lonely trevor’s interactions with women show he does not have healthy relationships with women one is with a prostitute stevie whom he is a patron of throughout the film another woman is a waitress maria whom trevor believes he interacts with but is actually one of trevor’s hallucinations realistically trevor never interacted with his waitress whom was unrecognizable to trevor when he is not hallucinating trevor’s work environment is a constant stressor trevor’s boss informs trevor he “is on his shit list” trevor is confronted by his bosses and asked for a urinary analysis because they believe he “looks like shit” thus he must be on drugs coworkers invite him to play poker and trevor declines upon doing so a coworker responds “what’s wrong with you you used to be alright” while another coworker says “you were never alright but you used to hang” trevor creates a hazardous situation at work while in an induced fatigue hallucination resulting in a coworker losing his hand due to trevor’s actions trevor’s coworkers are hostile and aggressive towards him after the workrelated accident thus trevor experiences persecutory delusions and referential delusions trevor experiences many lifestressors throughout the film such as injuring others himself losing his job losing relationships and legal issues trevor is consumed by his own delusions and hallucinations which are induced from a hitandrun trevor allows his memory to torment himself and has poor coping skills trevor’s coping technique of thought repression to handle the hitandrun make him feel enormous amounts of guilt the implicit guilt trevor experiences is explicitly seen throughout the film by his sticky notes in his home trevor’s hitandrun provoked the negative image of self to control all aspects of his life trevor has no desired goals or outcomes from his life except to answer sticky notes he leaves himself “who are you” is a sticky note trevor leaves himself to remind him to seek for whom he really is trevor’s weaknesses are his inability to interact socially and distinguish what is actually reality trevor is paranoid from his hallucinations and delusions and he frequently feels as if people are following him trevor thoughtfully analyzes situations to “expose” plots against him while doing so he throws himself in front of a moving car in order to get information from the police upon doing so the police inform him he is committing a felony and so he runs through underground tunnels to evade pursuit trevor finally realizes who he is by the end of the film he is an individual that killed a little boy by committing a hitandrun after realizing who he is a “killer” trevor turns himself into the police for the hitandrun the individual who he hallucinated throughout the film was himself as ivan and maria the victim’s mother trevor is able to sleep once he turns himself into the police description of the problem the opening scene is trevor standing in front of a mirror looking at his self then replies “shit” in disgust while looking at his reflection trevor holds a negative image of himself in this scene trevor’s shirt is off and his underweight body is revealed trevor displays physical symptoms of anorexia nervosa such as his body weight sunken eyes and puffy cheeks individuals who interact with an individual suffering from anorexia nervosa display concern for their health this is displayed as trevor is asked “are you alright” throughout the film indicating others do not perceive him as being in an okay state others ask trevor if he uses drugs throughout the film the prostitute and waitress try to feed trevor food in many scenes the women say “if you were any thinner you wouldn’t exist” trevor’s actions of not eating and properly nourishing his body are common for individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa specifically the restrictive type trevor orders pie at a diner he goes to but he is never seen eating the pie fatigue is a common sign of anorexia nervosa due to malnourishment trevor reports to always be tired cannot sleep nor has slept in the past year trevor’s sexual relations are not atypical of one with anorexia nervosa since he is the prostitute’s “best costumer” trevor socially withdraws which is a symptom associated with anorexia nervosa trevor loses touch with reality and those whom interact with him call him crazy and psycho the persecutory delusions and referential delusions may be a side effect from longterm malnutrition and dehydration trevor believes his coworkers are plotting against him and ends up losing his job when he behaves erratically by physically attacking his coworkers the physical attack results in trevor becoming short in breath another common symptom displayed with the disorder diagnosis one possible diagnosis for trevor reznik from the dsm ivtr would be anorexia nervosa restrictive type 3071 trevor experiences many social and economical stressors as well including a hostile work environment negative coworker interactions social interaction nonexistent job loss committing a hitandrun and a loss of relationships criterion that are met for anorexia nervosa include a refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height trevor was substantially under 85 of the body weight he should have maintained c disturbance in the way in which ones body weight or shape is experienced undue influence of body shape on selfevaluation or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight trevor was disturbed by his body image as indicated with his response to his reflection trevor denied the seriousness of his underweight body he does not seem aware of his diet weight or health thus in denial of his personal health difficulties diagnosing trevor reznik include lack of knowledge about family history lack of personal history lack of medical history and lack of selfreport from him accuracy of portrayal trevor reznik’s suffering from anorexia nervosa is not very apparent due to his inattentiveness about his body weight therefore anorexia nervosa may be mislabeled in this film trevor never explicitly states or indicates he has a fear of gaining weight which is typical for those whom suffer from anorexia nervosa trevor’s lack of concern with his body weight is not an accurate portrayal of an individual who suffers from anorexia nervosa if an individual watching the film knows what signs and symptoms to be aware of when assessing an individual who suffers from anorexia nervosa then they may be able to diagnose trevor reznik as having the disorder an individual who is aware of common symptoms and signs of anorexia nervosa may be able to decipher trevor’s disorder as an accurate portrayal a stressor murdering a little boy may have been the onset for anorexia nervosa and as such the film does accurately depict the course typical of individuals with anorexia nervosa this includes trevor not eating acknowledging his poor health and holding a negative image of self trevor never ate food during the film trevor’s physical symptoms were very apparent but others in the film attributed this to drug use trevor’s fatigue delusions and hallucinations may be symptoms due to severe malnourishment and dehydration individuals who watch the film would be able to understand how one who suffers from anorexia nervosa lives with constant paranoia of his selfimage and induced onset of anorexia nervosa that may have caused the delusions and hallucinations from inadequate diet the film is accurate because people suffering from anorexia nervosa do not acknowledge the pervasiveness of their disorder trevor never acknowledges that his poor health is due to his lifestyle treatment treating trevor reznik would require him to acknowledge having the disorder anorexia nervosa the patient’s willingness and acceptance of the disorder are essential for treatment to a progressive lifestyle to changing behavior treatment would focus on two main goals 1 trevor must gain weight and nourish his body with an adequate diet and 2 address trevor’s psychological and environmental stressors an empirically supported treatment widely used is family and group therapy trevor lacks a support system such as family and friends who are usually the people who initiated treatment for individuals suffering from the disorder typically family and friends monitor diet and exercise for individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa the lack of a social support trevor receives makes treatment difficult trevor would have more success in selfhelp groups since he lacks a family for family therapy the selfhelp group meetings would allow trevor the opportunity to interact with others suffering from anorexia nervosa the selfhelp group meetings would enlighten trevor about anorexia nervosa tremendously in order for selfhelp treatments to be successful trevor must attend the meetings regularly and change his behavior through the acquisition of new knowledge the selfhelp groups may be the social support trevor needs to overcome anorexia nervosa trevor must change his attitude behaviors diet and physically exercise to live a healthy lifestyle if trevor avoids situations and environments that are mental triggers for his disorder he will overcome the disorder with successful treatment trevor’s successful treatment seems unlikely and he seems vulnerable to enduring a chronic episode that will ultimately end in his body’s expiration cyclothymic

experiences hypomania and depression c no major depressive episode manic episode or mixed episode has been present during the first 2 years of the disturbance although at one point dolores

schizophrenia schizophreniform disorder delusional disorder or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified dolores exhibits no psychotic symptoms she possesses no firmly held delusions e the symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance eg a drug abuse a medication or a general medical conditioned eg hyperthyroidism her weight gain stems from her own belief in herself not a medical condition while she experiments with alcohol and marijuana she has no history of substance abuse or dependence f the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning dolores fails at almost all of her relationships she has no friends in high school and her only friend in college was the dorm’s maid her marriage

means she is unsympathetic hard to relate to and it is almost impossible to feel bad for her she manages to ruin her relationships all on her own and she takes tragedy to an extreme the book demonstrates the difficulty that may be faced by others who have relationships with cyclothymic individuals it also demonstrates the impacts a mood disorder can have on every aspect of one’s life it is accurate in its depiction of the feelings that accompany cyclothymia describing hypomania as “power” and depression as “oppressive” dolores’ mother may also have bipolar disorder reflecting the possibility that bipolar disorder may be more common in first degree relatives there are some inaccuracies though the therapy that dolores undergoes is inaccurate her therapy is very psychoanalytic in nature focusing on her mentally unstable mother and sex her therapist even goes as far as to pretend to be her mother her treatment is also only slightly effective and she still experiences cycles as she gets older the book does not do much to describe any sort of mental disorder instead it paints a picture of a woman who has lived a miserable life caused mainly by her own hands treatment the first treatment that should be implemented for dolores is a lifestyle change her extremely sedentary lifestyle would benefit from exercise and diet which could help stabilize mood this would have to be highly regulated in order for her to follow it and actually make the changes following the implementation of exercise cognitive therapy should be used cognitive behavioral therapy interpersonal therapy or group therapy could be utilized due to dolores’ inability to relate well with others cognitive behavioral therapy should be used if therapy is ineffective medication could be used but only as a last result due to the health problems dolores already has due to her weight
