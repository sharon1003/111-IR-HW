what does wattage equivalent mean the term “wattage equivalent” is used to compare more efficient types of light bulbs to traditional incandescent bulbs although a watt is used to measure energy consumption most consumers have used the amount of watts a light bulb uses to determine the brightness of an incandescent bulb for example an incandescent bulb that uses 100w would be brighter than an incandescent bulb that uses 40w since led light bulbs consume less energy they use fewer watts making it difficult to determine the brightness emitted from a led bulb solely on the number of watts used most led light bulb manufacturers label the wattage equivalent to that of an incandescent bulb to make it easier for consumers to choose the correct light bulb for their specific lighting needs however since led light bulbs come in a variety of color types such as warm white daylight and cool white it can affect how bright or dim the light bulb appears for instance if a cool white led bulb has the wattage equivalency of a 60 watt incandescent bulb the led light may appear brighter than the incandescent because of the color of light it emits this can also occur with the type of beam angle the light bulb emits a light bulb with a more directional beam angle may appear brighter than a light bulb with a very wide beam angle shop light bulbs by wattage equivalent here
