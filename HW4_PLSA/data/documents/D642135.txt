142page booklet naxos 855803435 isbn 1843790068the warmest and perhaps the most beloved of all beethovens nine symphonies the socalled pastoral is a festival of enchantment from beginning to end though pictorial in many of its images and in the titles given to each movement beethoven stressed that the symphony was more an expression of feelings than a painting the feelings it arouses in the listener are of continuous joy and wonder but the craft behind them is hardly less wonderful here we explore the piece from the inside out discovering just how this magnificent musical oak grows from the tiniest of acorns and encountering in the process one of the greatest magicians in musical history noone understood better than beethoven that if you want to have the listeners whole attention you might as well grab it at the outset thus begins jeremy siepmann in his illuminating exploration of beethovens pastoral symphony here taking a brief overview of beethovens symphonic openings before focussing exclusively on no 6 the most expansive and relaxed of the symphonies the pastoral has magic wherever you listen  2 cds and 5 movements later we understand why disc 1beethoven ludwig van

musical acorns the outline of melody the shape of a question 0000424 the question in the pastoral repeated 0000045  and answered 0000126 the opening phrase ends on a note full of pregnant expectation 0000197 starting with a stop 0000368 the rhythmic profile of the opening phrase a two  part construction 0000529 phrase one part one 00000910 phrase one part two 00000611 the properties of rhythmic ambiguity the question of phrase one answered 00010312 phrase two from meander to march 00002713 the makings of a conversation contrast and variation 00004714 repetition as a major factor but its never mere repetition each time something new is added 00003315 from soft to loud and back again instrumental enrichment from horns and double  basses 00001816 mega  repetition violins play exactly the same little fragment ten times in a row 00002917 but no two repetitions are quite the same varieties of contrast 00003418 more variation pitch rises violins joined frist by the clarinet then by the oboe 00001919 return to opening idea but with new instrumentation and articulation 00002520 clarinets horns bassoons and flutes now join expansive variation 00004921 new insistent rhythm derived

strings 00003224 sudden change of key from the home key tonic to the dominant 00003025 arrival at the hightly contrasting second main theme 00005526 unusual properties of second main theme 00021527 rhythmic clash between simultaneous groups of three beats and groups of two 00010928 winds fall selent as the violins and violas interrupt with a new theme 00003029 winds answer with the same morse  like rhythm but at half the speed 00005130 crescendo leads to strings acceleration of the pace with no increase in tempo 00010531 beginning of coda directly based on morse  like rhythm of the main theme 00002232 strings reiterate small fragment of the new theme 13 times in a row 00004833 a simple rising violin phrase leads to a repeat of the exposition 00001834 the nature and function of the development section in sonata form harmonic rhythm explained 00022235 the nature of harmonic rhythm illustrated 00003536 a typically beethovenian exercise in the frustration of expectation 00003837 repetitiousness and magic effected largely through instrumental colour 00004238 then come four almost identical bars 00000839 even greater magic with sudden switch of key and tone colour 00002840 entire development section up to this point 00015541 the development continued 00012342 increased unease and suspense as harmonic rhythm accelerates 00020343 arrival at the point of recapitulation back to the beginning as a reminder 00015044 beginning of recapitulation 00005045 more beethovenian frustrations of expectations which he himself has just set up 00010146 harmonic rhythm speeds up giving the impression of an accent on every beat 00003447 prevailing mood restored new theme from clarinets and bassoons 00002848 violins and violas take up theme horns cellos double  basses accompany 00004849 a hush falls followed by a return of the movements most familiar tag in strings 00005850 clarinet takes up the running triplet figures of the main closing theme 00003251 first violins take up

to round  like overlappings 00005257 transitional bridge theme sets off for new key group but is it and does it 00003958 will he or wont he beethoven keeps us guessing 00010959 the run  up to the second group 00011460 arrival at the second group but where is the actual second subject 00003961 a new tune is introduced by the bassoon 00003862 tune is repeated three times 00010063  which the full orchestra now takes up in varied form 00004564 theme carried by flutes and first violins in a charmingly waltz  like development 00004865 a reminder of precedent 00001466 back to the prevailing triple  metre with violins bassoons and flutes 00001667 another reminder of precedent 00001668  and a cue to some unexpected departures 00003869 the transformational magic of beethovens tone  painting  and a new varation 00005070 conversation of clarinet flute and oboe on the way to the development 00004371 harmonic movement emphasised by violins oboe takes up the first subject 00003872 flute and oboe discuss the first subject before arriving together at the transition 00010473 gains in volume and intensity lead to a new key  change 00004774 more thematic transformation through the agency of tone  colour 00011175 harmonic fluideity  instability  as the central engine of the development section 00014076 harmonic instability thematic dissolution increase then lessen with approach of recapitulation 00014177 recap and transformation key and material are right but what a change of presentation 00012978 just when we know whats coming beethoven changes the rules or at least the harmony 00005379 transformation by reorchestration switch to long sustained chords then everything stops 00012080 the silence is broken by voices of nightingale flute quail oboe and cuckoo clarinet

singing continuous legato 0000234 entire orchestra gives out opening theme this time fortissimo and with powerful accents 0001065 a mustical ball game the contrast of this and the first two movements could hardly be greater 0000336 after quietly teasing suspense beethoven mocks village band first the oboe then the bassoon 0001187 clarinet joins in then horn takes the tune  the dance no longer boisterous but lyrical 0000488 strings sweep the village musicians aside and hurtle us into the new boisterous trio section 0000469 the air is alive with the sound of mock bagpipes tambourines and fifes 00010010 coda begins as the movement itself begins but soon diverges in harmony and instrumentation 00011811 original layout compressed order of events is changed nd beethoven springs a big surprise 00004212 third movement complete 000514fourth movement thunderstorm13 unparalled portrait of natures power over humanity with some stupendous orchestration 00030514 self  generating form and

recurrnece later in the movement 00002217 rain motif derived from descending scale pattern from the violins at the outest 00001318 shivering tremolandos from the strings and increasingly eerie harmonies from the wind 00001819 steady crescendo in strings terrifying downward spelling  out of chords in the violins 00013720 extremes of dynamic contrasts the unsettling disturbing undermining effects of chromaticism 00010221 abandonment of melody and most traces even of rhythm sustained discordant harmony 00002022 storm dispersed the sun reappears bathing sodden earth below with its life

times in a row  and yet never the same way twice 00010628 now we get the whole orchestra playing full out with violins all double  stopping 00003629 transition to the next section based on the last two notes of the main theme 00004330 the rhythmic basis of new transition theme first in violas then takes up by first violins 00003831 another rhythmic details of extended transition comes increasingly into the foreground 00002932  and is then heard in expanded version taken in sequence by the strings from the top down 00005133 new phrase introduced by violins brings us resoundingly back to the opening material 00011334 main theme re  orchestrated unexpected drift into another key and a new gently flowing theme 00021535 hints of a return to main theme long pedal point running commentary from the violins 00005836 main theme returns but significantly altered and not entirely intact 00003737 running commentary now heard in the middle with alternating pizzicatos both above and below 00002438 part three of main theme given to entire orchestra leading to final appearance of theme two 00012139 extended coda overlapping variations of main theme rather in the manner of a round 00020940 suddenly the scene changes a variation of the running commentary cited in tracks 34 and 36 00005141 the crowning glory as the shepherds song of thanksgiving takes on a heavenly magnificence
