the confidence interval can be estimated for a coefficient of variation in much the same way as for a mean hence the 95 confidence interval of the coefficient of variation cv is given by t multiplied by the standard error of cv the standard error of the cv is given by the cv divided the square root of double the number of observations algebraically speaking 95ci cv  cv ± t α005 df n1 se cvwhere the standard error se of the coefficient of variation cv is approximately se cv ≈ cv√2nand the standard error se of the coefficient of variation corrected for bias cv is se cv ≈ cv 114n√ 2n these confidence limits to the coefficient of variation are only valid if sampling is from an approximately normally distributed population
