example of abg printout although used as a noun an arterial blood gas abg refers to the sampling of blood from an artery with the aim of analysing the blood gas concentration contents  hide1 what is measured2 terms definitions and normal values3 indications4 technique41 anatomy42 preparation43 equipment44 procedure5 references what is measured in a basic arterial blood gas reading separate electrodes measure 3 separate valuesp hoxygen partial pressure  p o 2carbon dioxide partial pressure  p co 2  several other values are derived from these three values using the hendersonhasselbach equation and other similar formulae eg oxygen saturation  many modern machines have additional electrodes that can measure other useful information eg haemoglobin subtypes electrolytes glucose and lactate  terms definitions and normal valuesp hthe negative logarithm of the concentration of hydrogen ions p h  log h   note that the p h scale isnegative  smaller number means more acidiclogarithmic  small changes in p h can equate to large absolute changes in h  the normal value is between 735  745 some machines display h  instead of p h if this is the case just remember the values 35 and 45 p h 735  h  of 45 n m while at the other end p h 745  35 n m units for gas partial pressure a pascal is the siderived unit and the preferred units in the uk in the us it is common to use millimetres of mercury instead mm hg atmospheric pressure is about 760 mm hg or 101 k pa which gives a rough conversion factor of about 304 ie 1 k pa  75 mm hgp o 2this is effectively the oxygen concentration although the correct terminology is the partial pressure which reflects the contribution of oxygen to overall gas pressure the normal range is 100  130 kilopascals k pap co 2the partial pressure of co 2 normal range 45  60 k paactual bicarbonate the concentration of hco 3  derived from p h and p co 2 using the hendersonhasselbach equation normal range 21  26 mmolstandard bicarbonate the calculated concentration of hco 3  if the sample it were at standard conditions that is at a temperature of 37°c and a p co 2 of 53 k pa 40mm hg the middle of the p co 2 reference range by assuming a p co 2 of 53k pa the standard bicarbonate compensates for any abnormality in hco 3  caused by a respiratory causebase excess assuming standard conditions see above this is the amount of strong acid in millimoles required to bring the p h of the sample to 740 once again the respiratory contribution to acidosis or alkalosis is compensated for a negative base excess is equivalent to an acid excess a value outside of the normal range 2 to 2 mmol suggests a metabolic cause for the abnormality for a more detailed explanation of units of pressure see pressure  indications technique anatomy accessible sites radial artery brachial artery femoral artery arteries in foot rarely used but can be useful for arterial cannulation preparation allens test not proven to be useful equipment arterial blood gas syringe the syringe comes with a cap which has porous material allowing air bubbles but not blood to be excluded from the top of the syringe after the blood is taken the needle is pushed into the blue piece of rubber to prevent sharps injury prepare equipment abg syringe and needle various types are available most modern ones are selffilling ie do not need the operator to draw back the plunger they also come with anticoagulant in the syringe either as a heparin liquid or as a small pledget containing heparin some selffilling syringes must have the plunger fully pushed down to expel heparin eg pulsator® as shown in photograph on reaching the artery the blood pressure is sufficient to push the plunger back and fill the syringe for other selffilling syringes you pull back the plunger to the appropriate volume required on hitting the artery the syringe allows air to be expelled and replaced with blood if no specialised equipment is available use a standard syringe and needle draw up a small amount of heparin and expel it this is more fiddly as you need to fix the position of the needle and syringe with one hand and aspirate with the other alcohol wipe cotton gauze or dental roll tape to secure gauze procedure feel for maximum point of pulsation make small indent using cap of needle administer local anaesthetic advance needle hold needle still while the blood flows into the syringe remove needle apply gauze or dental roll advise patient to press for a few minutes references categories anaesthetics  chemical pathology  critical care medicine  respiratory medicine  practical procedures
