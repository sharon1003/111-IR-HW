transcend those of any particular nationstate steven hiatt—global empire the web of control a game as old as empire crisis as possibility or globalization à la française general charles de gaulle this most beloved french president and iconic figure of french resistance and morality once formulated an aphorism whose hideous veracity is only equaled by the unscrupulous zealwith which france put it into practice throughout history france he said has no friends but onlyinterests this gaullist maxim which foreboded an unchanged paradigm of philosophical disinformationeconomic strangulation military persecution and political destabilization if it has proven factual over timeand has helped france accumulate a colossal fortune to the detriment of its former colonies is today beingchallenged by most frenchspeaking african countries perhaps the most powerful counterhegemonicsocial movement of the twenty first century witnessed in french africa is the resistance movement that hasbeen taking place in côte divoire since 2002 sidiki bakaba an ivorian filmmaker has documented it inhis barehanded victory1 it is a mobilization and struggle against french neocolonial agenda disguisedunder the coat of globalization the objective of this polymorphous resistance movement is to unveil and defeat frances imperial economic and political scheme wherever it will manifest itself in côte divoire and under whichever form it will hide côte divoire the ivorian patriotes often chant will be the graveyard of frances deceitful policy in its former colonies what they mean is that at least in côte divoire they are determined to put an end to the french arsonist policy by which france has historically schemed to setmultiple fires in africa in order to hire itself as emergency management agency via the united nations and the world financial institutions the logic of french interventions in africano matter under which form they come into view the various french interventions in africa have never had a philanthropic thrust french intrusions in africa have always been driven by logic of maximumwealth through minimum or no effort historically the french republic has seldom won a war in fact the french have systematically lost most wars even the ones that they confidently declared on their neighborsand each time france was defeated it turned to africa or to the caribbean with the most destructive designsto assuage its bruised ego and to rebuild its broken finances an understanding of the french policy in africa—and the caribbean—whereby in moments of political and financial distress at home crises areimplemented abroad as possibility for hexagonal improvement could inform a discussion of thecontemporary stance against frances brand of globalization in africa in general and in côte divoire in particular in 1871 in the aftermath of the francoprussian war a war that france declared and seemed so confident to win on its prussian neighbor france emerged a broken and demoralized nation with a diminishedterritory a poor economy and an injured reputation the german alliance had just defeated france annexed its territories of alsace and lorraine and handed the french government a reparation invoice theequivalent of one billion dollars to be paid within threeyear despite its drained reserves france managedto acquit itself of the enormous bill long before the scheduled deadline frances alacrity to make good onthe german humiliating tab would have seemed a casual occurrence if almost fifty years before this eventa less powerful country algeria asking that france reimbursed a loan it had owed for too long had notpaid a heavy cost for its impertinence in fact the immediate economic outcome of the 1789 french revolution was catastrophic agricultural methods in france had remained archaic unlike british farmers for instance french farmers had not been able to develop large agricultural exploitations to sustain the local markets and bring in muchneeded revenues the small farms could hardly feed the frenchpopulations and the price of grain and firewood had skyrocketed bread the quintessential french foodwas being rationed france was on the verge of famine and an even more dangerous prospect was developing napoleons hungry armies in italy and spain were getting irritable and a mutiny could breakany time subsequently france turned to two algerian commercial houses bacri and busnach for a loanin money and grains in order to remedy the countrys hardship however bacri and busnach too owedsome money to the algerian sovereign dey kodja hussein and they were waiting for france to honor itstab so they could settle their debt with the dey in 1815 by the end of the napoleonic failed war frances debt to algeria was about 18 million francs perhaps the merchants had asked dey hussein to recover themoney from french authorities on their behalf so that they could also settle their debts with him whateverthe case dey hussein grew impatient with frances tergiversations in 1827 during a heated argument with pierre deval the french consul in algeria about frances longdue balance the deys flywhisk flew in theface of the french consul king charles x who was not very eager to pay off his delinquent debt to algeria seized this occasion to protest what he perceived in the deys gesture as lack of respect for the french crown despite dey husseins explanation that his gesture was in response to pierre devalspersonal insult to him and not a condescension directed at the king of france 600 french ships landed 37000 troops in algeria on june 14 1830 the french soldiers engaged in the most despicable acts ofreligious vandalism and human right abuses they raided mosques and transformed them in cathedrals they destroyed private properties they raped women and executed hundreds of algerians less than a month later on july 5 the french deposed dey hussein by february 1831 algeria became effectively a french settlement colony and french authorities invited 4500 french colonists to farm the fertile coastallands of algeria2 the french occupation of algeria was not easy nonetheless until 1962 the algerians resisted the french finally in 1962 the algerians handed the french one of their most humiliating defeatsin history germany of 1870 was not 1830s algeria france understood that it was not in its interest todelay its obligation toward the germans so france paid its debt promptly and spent the ensuing years ruminating its defeat and thinking of ways to brighten its tarnished image in europe many social engineerssuggested that france should concentrate its efforts overseas and build itself an empire that would bothreplenish its depleted coffers and extend to inferior races its ideals of civilization france it should be noted had been present in africa as early as 1642 and had actively participated in the slave trade that sold more than 28 millions africans in europe and in the americas between 1650 and 1900 at that time the purpose was clearly economic and no one spoke of extending french superiorcivilization to the inferior races of africa in the later years of the 1800 however the climate was nolonger the same by 1804 denmark initiated an abolitionist wave that started to sweep europe and america in 1848 france reluctantly abolished the official practice of slave trade among the people whohad expressed disapproval of the slave trade was olaudah equiano a former slave equiano was also aformer slave owner who had understood that slavery could only be stopped if there could be an incentivefor not practicing it so he tried to convince slave owners that slave trade was depleting africa of potentialconsumers of european goods and he urged europeans to turn instead to disseminating european civilization to africa as they exploited the many african raw materials from which slave trade had distracted them3 the functioning semantic pair was thus launched commerce and civilization whichwould henceforth be seized on as determining the scope of frances—and european—new globalizingefforts in africa taking equianos suggestions to globalize otherwise at heart european countries racedfor the riches of africa ivory gold timber cocoa coffee rubber palm oil nuts and tropical fruits andnot slaves—even though some lawbreakers were still trading in slaves for seventy years went bybetween the danes abolition of slavery in 1792 and the effective stop of slave importation to europe became the new commodities that brought huge profits to european markets by the late 1800 africa became so crowded with european fortune seekers that conflicts became inevitable to better regulate trade in africa and to avoid conflicts among the international actors in the region the european powers held a conference in berlin between november 15 1884 and february 26 1885 under the chairmanship of german chancellor otto von bismarck although the organizers publicized the conference as a meetingfor discussing issues of humanity peace and the civilizing and welfare of the native populations of africa it was definition of the rules to govern the europeans claims of territories in africa that actuallydominated the talks the conference resolved the question of territorial conflicts among europeancountries by deciding that any european nation that formally gave other nations notice of its occupation ofa territory would be recognized as the rightful owner of that territory so having defined the rules of the game european powers rushed to slash as larger morsels as they could of the african pie however still haunted by the specters of defeat the french had yet to be convinced their 1870 beating by the germans had dampened all their enthusiasm for globalizing enterprises furthermore their algeriancolonies had not turned out to be what india had been to great britain algerians continued to oppose long drawnout resistances to the french occupation and the north african colony had cost more headaches to france than it had brought in profits in light of so few encouraging events french financiers were hesitantto spend money in african adventures they preferred less uncertain governments bonds and french politicians preferred for their constituencies a good potaufeu to the bad bread that they ate during the1870 german siege of paris on the other hand the wounds of humiliation inflicted by the germans wereslow to heal and many government officials believed that france could shine again if only it could securefor itself a large african empire five months after the berlin conference a debate between proponents andopponents of colonial expansion was raging in the hall of the french assemblée nationale the two mostmemorable protagonists of this debate were jules ferry ferry was twice prime minister of france oncefrom september 1880 to november 1881 and another time from february 1883 to april 1885 and georges clémenceau on july 28 1885 five months after being driven out of office for overseeing thefailed the 1885 chinesefrench war jules ferry was making a case for colonialism in the chamber of the national assembly ferry invoked three arguments in favor of frances colonial expansion economically within the logic of its industrial aspirations france needed to find new markets outside europe and the united states for itsexport commodities as germany and america had become increasingly protectionist at the same time asthey had been flooding france with new agricultural and industrials products economists like leroy beaulieu who tried to establish a nexus between britains wealth and its possession of an overseas empireand who argued that the acquisition of a colonial empire would indubitably bring economic wealth to france supported this argument5 from a humanitarian perspective ferry argued that as a member of thehigher race france had a divine right and a duty to civilize the inferior races perfect them andimprove their backward morals from a political and patriotic perspective ferry insisted that franceneeded to ensure its place in the world by performing acts of grandeur for ferry amidst the european rushfor territorial expansion any politics of abstention on the part of france would amount to abdication to ascertain its position on the international exchequer france would have to start importing its language itscustoms its flag and its genius6 replying to ferry clémenceau charged that ferrys dichotomy of superiorraceinferior race was suspect and reminiscent of the german social engineers discourse in the dayspreceding the francoprussian war the germans like ferry was doing then had argued for racialsuperiority german scientists had asserted that because the french were an inferior race france wasdoomed to lose the war so clémenceau urged his fellowmen not to repeat this german axiom against african nations by trying to disguise violence under the cunning designation of civilization for him theexcuse of right or duty to civilize was nothing but a right to brutality that scientifically advanced societies tend to arrogate to themselves in order to take possession of less advanced nations and torture their citizensand exploit them for the benefit of socalled superior races clémenceau concluded that to make civilizationa justification for colonization was to adjoin hypocrisy to violence in any case the early 1890s witnessedthe rise of a multitude of strong procolonialist pressure groups such as the comité de lafrique françaisethe comité de légypte the comité de lasie française or the comité de madagascar all unified under thebanner of the parti colonial which made the case for a revival of frances place in the world theirargument was less to sell an african business venture to french investors than to sell an african empire tothe state by 1890 a colonial consensus was in place in france which advocated a new globalizing venturebased less on treaties with local chiefs and more on forceful military approach7 against all apprehensionsthe french militarized globalization in subsaharan africa turned out to be more lucrative than even procolonists had previously thought when the dust of the european global dash to africa settled the continentwas parceled into fifty territories and most european countries had their african colonies francegermany great britain and portugal were the countries that obtained the lion part france snatched a largeterritory in west africa from mauritania to chad french west africa and gabon and congo frenchequatorial africa as well as the island of madagascar france became an empirebuilding nation itsoverseas empire comprised the territories of present day mauritania senegal mali burkina faso beninguinea côte d’ivoire niger togo gabon the democratic republic of congo the central african republic cameroon algeria tunisia morocco the islands of mauritius reunion seychelles madagascar comoros and mayotte the french territories did not all have the same status they were slave colonies exploitation colonies settlers’ colonies or protectorates and they were ruled accordingly most french colonies in the caribbeanwere slave colonies whereas in subsaharan africa they were principally exploitation colonies inexploitation colonies france’s goal was to run away with most of the resources the colonies could yield coffee cocoa lumber palm oil rubber tropical fruits and nuts and various minerals for the benefit of themetropolitan state also africans from exploitation colonies were not on the same footing as those livingin settlers colonies or protectorates settlers colonies and protectorates had local rulers collaborating with a french appointed consul the protectorate of tunisia had a local sovereign the bey in the settlers colonyof algeria it was the dey these first attempts at globalization were like the ones that preceded themdevoid of any real reciprocity the native peoples of the colonies resisted them ferociously and whateverjustification the imperialist countries gave for their retreat from the colonies they did not leave on theirown good will the cost in human and financial capital was too high for france to sustain thedetermination of the colonized too strong to break the imperialist countries left because they were simply and purely beaten and forced to recognize the autonomy of their colonies however the hexagonal impulse for profit was so imperative that france devised a number of cooperation schemes to remain the privileged speculator in the newly independent countries of africa frenchspeaking africas independences in the 1960s did not preclude france from seeking to exploit its former colonies frances politics in africa has consistently been governed by a protectionist itch an itchthat long after the african independences continues to make france think that it is the promised land itslanguage the quintessential language and its culture the exemplary culture and that by indoctrinating africans to think so to france can keep on transferring economic resources from africa to france asnatural and expected already during the colonial system frances protectionist impulse had mandated freeentry of french goods in the french african colonies and imposed tariffs on colonial goods entering france8 this decision had the obvious consequence of impoverishing the colonies while enriching themetropolis however the 1930s recession made it crucial for frances economic survival that french authorities transform the african colonies into consumer markets france thus eased tariffs on its colonies in order to allow them to sell more easily on french markets earn money buy french manufactured goodsand also pay interests on their debts at the same time in order to avoid competition from other powersfrance imposed quotas on some foreign imports to france and to french colonies france also forbade itscolonies to export certain products to foreign markets thus forcing those foreign countries to purchase onlyfrom france products that would otherwise be available in the colonies in addition france placed dutieson some foreign imports competing with colonial goods entering france these duties ranged from 11 onnoncolonial bananas to 110 on cocoa passing through 34 on peanuts and palm kernels and 91 onnoncolonial coffee although many analysts have wanted to see this preindependence preferentialsystem accorded to the colonies as having greatly contributed to keeping french africa afloat during the1930s economic slump and responsible for what came to be known in the 1980s as the economic miracle of côte divoire evidence disproves it9 in fact the marketdriven economy that this colonial system fosteredprovided the colonies with some money only to be returned tenfold to france furthermore this market economy which france managed to keep alive long after the african independences was the source of many economic shocks as it put frenchspeaking african nations at the mercy of international speculators the preferential economic systems established by france on its own—and later with the cooperation of the e c which became the e e c in 1975—actually sought to maximize frances profits by curbing francesdiminishing returns in the colonies already in 1959 the french commercial system made it possible for frances african colonies to consume 282 of french exports while contributing to 20 of french imports these numbers dropped to 78 of french exports used by francophone africa against 59 of french imports coming from africa the various conventions lomé yaounde lomé 2 which reinforced frances economic cooperation with its former colonies and later with anglophone africa and the acp states did little to create real conditions of development for noneuropean countries in fact francemaneuvered to exclude asian excolonies from the acp states on the ground that they would provedangerous competitors in a range of industrial products and the tiny country of mauritius a potentialcompetitor in textiles was asked by the e c to voluntarily restrain from the acp10 the e c states andparticularly france its most aggressive member did nothing to foster manufactures in africa as far as the e c was concerned africa was to remain an eternal supplier of raw materials and late 1980s washington consensus with its menu of onesided depoliticization of the state that opposes social public sectorinvestment in welfare job creation environmental protection healthcare education and poverty reduction11 offered france the blessing of the bretton woods institutions to carry on a game that it had been perfecting for so long that of draining off wealth from africa under the semblance of reciprocal improvement as it turned out economic globalization as conceived by the washington consensus presupposed an international violence economic globalization assumes often on the ground of mere bureaucratic sixthsense and no scientifically dependable instance that in order to improve the welfare of human populationsthe prescription is to oblige developing countries to finetune their economies according to therequirements of euroamerican multinational corporations by way of liberalizations of local markets theresult of this philosophicaleconomic exercise is that as was the case in the days of the colonization of africa it effectively relocates crises of economic deterioration from north to south the world bank andthe imfs persistence that developing countries open their economies to foreign direct investments hasenabled the reoccupation of the countries that have resolved half a century ago to determine the course of their particular developments away from the imperial ambitions of europe in most cases globalization hassucceeded in reinstating european—and american—imperialism by allowing first world capitalists quasiownershipof third world countries through purchases of strategic governmentowned enterprises such aspower water and communication companies the scheme works when the imperial state bails out banksinvestors and speculators and provides political pressure to open markets sends military expeditions toeliminate alternatives 12 in this grand design of recolonization disguised as globalization resistance isruthlessly squashed by a variety of coercive methods for the third world leaders who against the first worlds schema try to pursue a populist agenda that advocates national control of their countrys resourcesand benefits and who true to their people refuse to fall prey to the trap of corruption and the promise of first world lifestyle the ehm economic hit men game plan includes a full menu of oppositions to ensure compliance whether willing or not the menu includes subversion of the political process contact with and corruption of administration and business leaders corruption of the military of the media of trade unions and of academics and thestirring of ethnic and religious divergences a menu that seems to come directly from the handbook of thecolonial era and which begs to be verified against the inventory of treatments that countries like congocôte divoire and haiti to cite only these few have endured for daring to stand against the tripartitecollusion of the northern countries the united nations and the financial institutions and their corrupt localpolitical puppets in côte divoire this threefold conspiracy functioned along the axis of a highlevel african imf executive alassane dramane ouattara who doubled as a shady native informant during hisyears as prime minister of côte divoire his direct association with french multinationals bouygues and bolloré and his ties with the chirac government in france this web of international relationships is essential for understanding côte divoires resistance to globalization à la française côte divoire from economic prosperity to scarcitythe 1970s were an age of prosperity in côte divoire the skyrocketing prices on international markets of cocoa and coffee the countrys main export commodities had created an astonishing economic boomand established côte divoire as the preeminent economic power in the west africa signs of developmentwere visible in all sectors and economic observers were not shy to compare the ivorian economic sensationto the japanese miracle they were partly right the ivorian growth rate was only second to japans however this economic boom was heavily dependent on foreign capitals as it was tied to international speculators willingness to pay high prices for coffee and cocoa attempts to diversify the economy andlaunch development programs led the country to borrow external capitals which were not always well managed furthermore the falling prices of coffee and cocoa in the late 1970s and early 1980s amplifiedthe countrys external debt and led houphouët to turn to the world bank and the imf for loans to stabilizehis countrys economy the period spanning from the mid1980s to early 1990s was a time of mixedblessings for côte divoires economy the exploitation of newly discovered offshore oil reserves hadhelped alleviate some of the countrys hardships however the economic storm was not totally weathered amidst rumors of government layouts people took massively to the streets to protest what they interpreted as the results of the grab for power of the pdci party in power to save his presidency houphouët bentto the conditions of the bretton woods institutions and invited the imf economist alassane ouattara in april 1990 to chair the comité interministériel de coordination du programme de stabilisation et de relance economique interministerial committee for coordination of the stabilization and economic recovery program a committee in charge of reflecting on ways to tackle the economic crisis and findadequate solutions five months later an ailing houphouët appointed alassane ouattara prime minister what happens from april 1990 onward is a series of events that read like a novel dominique nouvian folleroux femme fataleouattaras proximity to houphouët allowed him greater closeness to ms nouvian folleroux the woman that would become his wife and most trusted associate in the most rocambolesque financialintrigues to define the political future of côte divoire the circumstances in which dominique nouvianwas introduced to the epicenter of power in abidjan are still not very clear today what is clear is that shebecame houphouëts official mistress and the exclusive administrator of houphouëts huge estate and partof the countrys estate her new title gave her tremendous name recognition and financial power even asher benefactors popularity at home was declining indeed in the early 1990s a fierce political oppositionassailed the ailing ivorian president houphouët for the first time the old man as he was affectionatelycalled in africa released his grip on power under the pressure of the bretton woods institutions and france he named ouattara prime minister legalized opposition parties and promised multiparty presidential and legislative elections in côte divoire the october 28 multicandidate presidential electionconfirmed the strength of the opposition and especially of houphouëts old political rival laurent gbgagbo leader of the socialist ivorian popular front fpi according to international observers gbagbogarnered more than 30 of the votes—though the official ballot count conceded him only 183 against817 for the seating president on november 26 1990 eighteen opposition parties competed against houphouëts pdci during the parliamentary elections houphouëts pdci retained 163 of the 175parliamentary seats if anything the contestation of the old mans hitherto absolute power was the confirmation of a new era houphouët was a diminished man nevertheless mrs dominique nouvian follerouxs business seemed to suffer no setback at all from houphouëts trouble at home au contraire among other things she sold some of houphouëts real estatesin france for the amount of 19 million euros a transaction that though suspicious by ivorian authoritiesput her at the center of french big business she acquired jacques desanges hair saloons in the united states aici agence iternationale de la commercialisation immobilière the real estate office that sheopened in abidjan was attracting big clients as she was making important friends her regulars were martin bouygues the french king of concrete owner at 429 of tf1 the first french tv station drawingmore than 316 of french tv audiences owner of lci another french tv channel special guest to nicolas and cécilia sarkozys wedding and godfather of their son louis sarkozy vincent bolloré business partner of bouygues king of cigarette paper and media—it was bolloré who paid the new frenchpresident a vacation trip to malta on his luxurious boat as a congratulation present after the 2006 frenchpresidential election it was he again who lent his private falcon 900 to sarkozy and his then new girlfriend carla bruni for their december 25 2007 vacation trip to egypt dominique strausskhan former minister of finance of president mittérand and imf president since 2007 bongo president of gabon who like houphouët before him has been so close to dominique nouvian folleroux as to also entrust the administration of his real estate and part of his countrys property to the gabon branch of mrs follerouxscompany aici run by her brother philippe nouvian other patrons of mrs dominique nouvian follerouxare blaise compaoré of burkina faso and kadhafi of libya hers was a network of powerful financialfriends the same network that ségolène royal the socialist candidate to the french presidential electionaccused on may 4 2007 of trying to influence french elections by manipulating the news14 the verynetwork that ms royal was denouncing during the french presidential elections is the association of powerful financial interests that mrs dominique nouvian folleroux has been able to weave since she firstentered houphouëts bedroom in abidjan dominique nouvian folleroux was the powerful woman that alassane ouattara said to have fallen in love with as he responded to president houphouëts imfcoerced call for helpouattara ouattara hes our man he cant do it nobody can such seemed to be the mindset of the bretton woods institutions and big international corporations with financial stakes in côte divoire since about the death of félix houphouët boigny in december 1993 an excellent student of the imf where he first worked from 1968 to 1973 before assuming variouspositions at the bceao central ban of west african states ouattara was very receptive to the international monetary funds prescription of structural adjustment programs in africa despite the burdenthat these programs put on local populations as prime minister of côte divoire his solutions forredressing the countrys economy did more harm than good ouattara cut subsidies to farmers asrecommended by the wto at the same time as the european union and the united states were heavilybacking their own farmers with huge subsidies he dismissed more than 10000 employees from the state payroll those who were lucky to keep their jobs saw their salaries reduced by 40 or were forced to accept an early retirement package he reduced access to early education by freezing the recruitment ofnew teachers he closed students subsidized restaurants he eliminated transportation and basic healthcareservices for students he imposed fees on the masses for basic healthcare services he initiated thedevaluation of the cfa at the rate of 100 cfa francs for 1 french franc he instituted the highlycontroversial resident cards for foreigners which was the source of much harassment toward foreignnationals coming from neighboring african countries and he aggressively pursued mauritanian and lebanese merchants for socalled back taxes in the upward of millions of cfa francs in a word ouattaraexecuted the world bankimfs recommendations to the letter these measures as it was to be expected frustrated the masses even further workers and students demonstrations intensified which under hisorders were repressed in blood scores of students were killed and student union and opposition leadersamong whom the current president laurent gbagbo and the leader of higher education teachers unionmarcel etté were jailed and tortured amidst international outcries and unsuccessful calls for anindependent investigation undeniably ouattara was a good student of the imf in côte divoire ouattarawas the praiseworthy son of a powerful institution that had reared him to serve the father unreservedly thequestion was whether he was really a son of côte divoire concerned with the interests of his fellow citizens as far as the world bank and the imf were concerned this question had no bearing so long as the washington consensus had a powerful spokesperson in the country that would guarantee the interests of itsshareholders so under further pressure the ailing president houphouët had ouattara cumulate theportfolios of prime minister minister of finance and interim president during houphouëts long sicknessand his medical treatment in europe in 1993 ouattara ordered that all public receipts collection of taxesdebts and returns from the customs the ports and even the treasury be directly deposited in a specialaccount at the office of the prime minister rather than at the treasury as it was customarily the case thisa typical management style to say the least quickly mixed individual assets with state property andmillions of dollars from the public treasury remained unaccounted for while ouattara taking as much as two flights a week to europe officially to visit his sick boss—but unofficially on capital flight missions was tucking enormous sums of money away in personal foreign bank accounts making him one of therichest men on earth ouattaras mysterious fortune raised some eyebrows even among his supporters however ouattaras questionable wealth did not cause the slightest shudder among the high priests of morality who in their immense chairs in the temples of virtue of 1818 h street as well as 700 19th streetin washington d c were sermonizing the world about good governance and saintliness why should theycare was it not fair that ouattara be rewarded for being such a great agent to his masters for côtedivoire however ouattaras activities were economically disastrous during his term as prime ministerouattara became one of the biggest actors of capital flight from côte divoire toward european banks ashe raided the countrys coffers he also depleted africa of much needed resources indeed capital flight the bulk of the private assets and as we have just seen with ouattara private and public assets can be easily mixed—that are legally or illegally held in foreign countries outside africa is one of the continents biggest impoverishers capital flight reported to amount to about us 22 billions isas much as half of the aid that africa needs for its development programs were this money brought backto africa it would constitute 64 of africas private capital stock16 as one of africas biggest capitaljetsetters alassane ouattara is without doubt and in proportion to the short time he spent as prime minister of côte divoire three years and 1 month among the leaders who have economically siphoned the continent the most as the prime minister was busy outsourcing his public function to the businessman in him thus mixing state capitals with private capitals dominique folleroux—whom ouattara had by then married during a1991 ceremony officiated by the former mayor of neuilly currently president of the french republicnicolas sarkozy—was now against all ethical propriety lobbying for bouygues and bolloré to acquirestateowned eeci energie electrique de côte divoire and sodeci société de distribution deau de côte divoire respectively power and water companies it did not take long for her clients to

symbolicfranc all against the objection of opposition leaders and even leaders of ouattaras previous party the pdci henri konan bédié at the time president of the national assembly fiercely opposed ouattarasunethical liberalization in the parliamentary chamber as a result of ouattaras collusion with frenchbusinessmen 27 of the assets of ivorian enterprises were frenchowned 240 subsidiaries and more than600 companies belonged to french businessmen which represented 68 of direct foreign investments in côte divoire the shady investments enabled by alassane and dominique ouattaras and which havemortgaged the economic and political future of côte divoire have been widely reported rightly so as quid pro quo investments mr michel camdessus a frenchman who was the president of the imf during

cannot afford or even imagine to have in france for consenting to the corrupt terms of french business in côte divoire at the detriment of the masses ouattara is allowed by france to realize his first worldist jouissance by plundering his countrys coffersundisturbed this lack of probity on the part of africas most influential economists and leaders ought to beexamined in relation to the dire future that their selfish proclivities set up for the continent between 1985and 1998 the net outflows from africa to developed countries have risen from of us 36 billion to thealarming amount of us 125

and remains unable to invest in public and private sectors which in turnerodes not just poverty reduction projects but also the confidence that honorable foreign investors have inthe continent and the cycle of poverty linked to debt servicing and fiscal deficit goes on until the corrupt agents facility to ransack is shortcircuited in côte divoire it was henri konan bédié the institutional heir to the presidency who put an end to ouattaras capital flight activities but not for long ouattaras parisian cronies were too determined to maintain their monopoly in the country to see the latter out of the political arena henri konan bédié not exactly the man paris had dreamed ofon december 7 1993 houphouët who for three years had been sidelined by his illness from participating actively in ivorian politics passed away in his native village of yamoussoukro the ivorian constitutionhad a provision for replacing a deceased head of state article 11 of the constitution stipulated that in such avacancy of power the president of the national assembly was to assume the duties of head of state untilthe outcome of new elections bédié was therefore the constitutional heir to houphouët howeverbypassing the legal process ouattara proclaimed himself legitimate successor to the presidency thisobvious constitutional hold up provoked uproar at the national assembly and during an unscheduled appearance on national tv bédié announced his intent to carry out his constitutional duty by finishing houphouëts term in the past during his years as president of the national assembly bédié had been openly critical of ouattaras complacent economic liberalism that widely opened the doors to foreign buyouts of strategiccompanies with very little regard for the countrys security at the time when french politicians led by minister of finance nicolas sarkozy were hammering at employees gatherings and at the french national assembly that edf french stateowned power company and gdf french stateowned gas companywere never going to be privatized because of their strategic importance to french economy ouattara theprime minister of côte divoire was selling his countrys power and water companies to the closest friendsof the french government19 what made sarkozys position so tenable in france and so untenable in côtedivoire could it be for the simple reason that one was dealing in one case with a country located in europe and in another case with a country located in africa it is this lack of moral reciprocity this kind of utter injustice that the movement of patriotes in côte divoire has taken to task in so doing their demonstration was also aimed at denouncing the collaborators from within who have betrayed their peoplefor the promise of economic lactification for the waves of coup détat and political instabilities that havesucceeded one another in côte divoire since 1999 are strangely laden with odors of organic betrayals eachtime côte divoire was affected by shockwaves of military blows ouattara was the insider that for thepromise of a first worldist enjoyment betrayed the loyalty of a country he claimed to love bédié like ouattara believed in economic liberalism only insofar as one can speak in relative terms bédies liberalism however was one that was committed to ensuring that his country would not lose totalsovereignty to wealthy investors from europe or from anywhere else for that matter and he was workingat it by making a number of reforms some of the measures that bédié took in that direction had to do withthe thorough identification of the populations living on the ivorian soil through a systematic censusprogram the cleaning up the prevalent anarchical land exploitation and the regulating of landownership infact from the mid to the late 1990s côte divoire was the second immigration destination in subsaharan africa right behind south africa with an unusually high immigrant population rate of 27 for 13 million ivorians the largest foreign communities were from mali 2 millions burkina faso 2 millions ghana 15 millions nigeria 500000 and in smaller numbers from benin and togo though an agreementamong the countries of ecowas economic community of west african states allowed a freecirculation and settlement of populations from any member state the migration to côte divoire was almostunidirectional the important immigrant populations from neighboring mali and burkina faso whose mainpurpose for coming to côte divoire was to work the fertile land of the country or to cut and burn trees forthe very lucrative charcoal business toward drier countries mali or burkina faso had clashed severaltimes with local populations over issues of landownership forest fires and severe national reserve deforestation in 1999 a land dispute between settlers from burkina faso and locals from the region of tabou west of côte divoire had caused about 12000 burkinabé to flee their lands this event whichtook place a year after the national assembly adopted a law that would prevent the sale of land toforeigner invited even harsher criticisms towards bédies reform bédies land reform did not sit well withhis malians and burkinabé counterparts the governments of mali and burkina faso relied heavily for theirnational income on the money that their expatriates sent from côte divoire they perceived in bédiesreform a pretext to dispossess their compatriots of lands they had been exploiting for years and they alsofound objectionable the reforms obvious consequence of depleting their countries of much neededrevenues in their resentment of bédies method the malians and burkinabé could find stronger allies in the french the old class of french landlords who acquired large portions of land in the southern part of the country often in obscure contexts with no proper or convincing legal papers stipulating forinstance the duration of the lease    oppose any form of land reform as it could jeopardize transfer of these lands to their descendants these french landlords and businessmen had seen their privileges increased and consolidated with ouattara under the administration of houphouëts prime minister the status of the state had shifted fromthat of a governmental institution to the status of a nongovernmental organization ngo—to use this termby james ferguson in other words the prime minister had lost interest in state affairs and had instead become a businessman increasingly drawn to establishing private business deals and building personalwealth to the disadvantage of public welfare in the context of bédies reform the question then waswhether after having had a taste of the state of côte divoire as a nongovernmental institution with all theadvantages that this conversion entailed france and the neighboring countries of côte divoire notablyburkina faso and mali were still inclined to see the administration of côte divoire return to its rightfulcondition of a governmental institution committed to the welfare of the masses this was the challenge that confronted the bédié government in the mid to late 1990s against this sociological background it becomes clear that bédies demise—for he was to fall soon—was not the result of mismanagement or hostility to openness in fact bédié was as open to fdis as ouattarahad been he was just a little more mindful of the governmental role of the state the fact that for the mostpart africas openness to international trade and finance has left it at the mercy of insatiable first worldcapitalists and corrupt third world collaborators should be less imputable to globalization itself than to theprobity of the protagonists in the globalizing enterprise globalization has succeeded in places where theactors involved have shown a minimum of moral decency available data for africa in the 1990s showsthat countries in north africa and south africa and côte divoire had managed a low level of poverty withhigh level of openness côte divoires numbers are 20 of poverty incidence for 40 of openness incidentally the data is not distributed on specific years of the 1990s but it is easy to surmise that the incidence of lower poverty occurred during the bédié years even bédies detractors acknowledged thatbetween 1995 and 1999 côte divoire had known economic growth and increase in individual wealth furthermore a trade policy review of côte divoires trade policies conducted by the world trade organization wto on july 4 and 5 1995 concluded with high praise for bédies government open tradepolicies and expressed optimism for côte divoires future22 bédies demise is just one more evidence that foreign direct investments or private capital flows are not that private after all foreign direct investmentsoften unleash state intervention with all its military shock and awe whenever a powerful state intervenesto invade a weak state one can be sure that some private investors from the powerful state unhappy abouttheir returns in the weak state have directly or indirectly triggered the military intervention history is littered with examples where private investors have sent their countries to war to protect or simply toincrease their dividends bédies lukewarm support for french interests was not what france had hoped for bédié was a man of frances but not their number one man his zeal for reforms could hurt frenchinterests in côte divoire ouattara had been more bighearted to french business with his uncheckedliberalization and his gré à gré surrender of public corporations to french investors and to his frenchpartners with ouattara in power france was sure to regain its slippery grip on côte divoire by continuingto buy under their market values stateowned enterprises and by continuing to get government contracts bybypassing any calls for bids that would put them in competition with investors from the united statescanada japan south african china among others for the sake of french interests bédié had to be deposed meanwhile ouattara who had returned to the imf in 1993 upon the supreme courts confirmation of bédié as legitimate head of state had been appointed by michel camdessus to serve as his deputy chairmanof the institution one year later though at the imf ouattara had not given up his presidential ambitionsneither was he willing to wait for regular elections to have his chance the massive foreign electorateconstituted by undocumented immigrants from mali and burkina faso many who had voted before in theoneparty system farcical elections that had confirmed and reconfirmed houphouët by acclamation and onwhich ouattara too was relying to win the 1995 presidential race had been compromised by bédiesidentification program bédies identification program required that only established ivorians should vote inpresidential elections though established foreign residents were still allowed to vote in legislative andmunicipal elections bédies land reform as well as his census and civic formation projects fell under theumbrella of what he had termed ivoirité this notion whose origin had misleadingly been attributed to bédié and which had even more deceitfully been translated as ivorianness rather than simply ivority as one had spoken of africanity americanity and francity elsewhere was said to have first appeared in1945 in dakar at a black students conference later in 1974 an ivorian writer and poet niangoran porquet used it in an article entitled ivoirité et authenticité ivorian scholar kanvaly fadiga defined itas the national consciousness the common will of brotherly people who have chosen to live together on the ivorian soil and share together the same sufferings the same joys and the same hopes why francité but not ivoirité ivoirité as bédié had recuperated it was first intended to be for the more than sixty ethnic communities of côte divoire a signifier of identification a social glue that would instill in them a morepatriotic stance and consequently a stronger attachment to the state and its institutions as embodying thesum total of all individual nationalistic expressions this was an essential societal project given the lack offervor that the ivorian populations had up till then expressed for the state and state institutions côtedivoire was in most ivorians eyes a stateecowas a sort of deadwood but a rich one nonethelesswhere any opportunistic member of the 15 ecowas nations and even beyond would come to seekfortune by all means necessary with no sincere attachment to the land but a lucrative one the people of côte divoire had lost faith in their successive governments as really preoccupied with safeguarding theirwelfare rather than bending over to live up to an image of sanctuary country by satisfying the caprices of ecowas this situation was exacerbated by houphouëts choice throughout his presidency of foreignnationals as cabinet members for instance raphaël saller france had been minister of finance and development mohamed diawara mali had been minister of development abdoulaye sawadogo burkina faso had been minister of agriculture hamadou thiam senegal had been minister of information tobetter understand this level of governmental openness and the resulting mass frustration that ensuedamericans would only have to imagine canadian brazilian columbian senegalese or antiguan nationals who have never been naturalized or who do not even intend to naturalize occupy posts in the united satesgovernment as treasury secretary hud secretary or secretary of health in the 1980s1990s a phrase thatillustrated the ivorian distrust in their government and their detachment from public property was theinfamous on sen fout ça appartient à letat who gives a damn it belongs to the state a phrase that would justify any act of vandalism or spoliation of state property bédies ivoirité intended to rectify this mass cynicism it intended to create the conditions for an allegiance that would no longer be based on ethnic background—as it had until then been the case in the context of thealoof and impersonal state but rather an allegiance that would be grounded in identification with thenationstate that was created on independence day august 7 1960 this was nothing novel in the sphereof cultural contestations coinages in ité suggesting allegiance to geographical national racial or linguisticorigins have abounded senghor the only black consecrated by france—this france so reactive toivoirité—in its so elitist french academy for being so french thus so right said in his december 11 1974course at the sorbonne that it was important to struggle to suffer and to die plus volontiers pour une –itéou une –itude que pour un –isme more readily for an –ity or an –itude than for an ism curiouslyhowever it seems that african heads of state have been more willing to struggle suffer and die for frances specificity than their own an illustrative example is their unashamed gathering around the themeof francophonie which as we learn again from senghor is no more no less than a synonym of francité in may 1968 during a conference at the university of beirut while defending the socalled peaceful and nonimperialistic nature of francophonie or francité senghor insisted that francophonie was not a war machine constructed by european imperialism but a mode of thinking a certain way a mode ofapproaching issues and seeking solutions a spirit of french civilization or francité francophonie senghordeclared is francité and francité he swore had not the slightest imperialistic bent in it but was merely theexpression of french civilization and culture devoid of any political agenda and while most africanleaders accepted the word of this griot of things french that francité would not harm a fly yet the sameleaders were quick to condemn ivoirité as a war machine today as in 1968 the most passionate defenderof francité is an african an exsenegalese president abdou diouf he is the current secretary general of francophonie he goes around world capitals selling french culture and civilization and promoting theexpansion of french business and policy and wherever he convenes his annual gathering a plethora of african leaders follow him—among whom bongo of gabon wade of senegal toumani of mali and compaoré of burkina faso have the privileged seats on the baseline lately however the proselytizerin chief of french culture diouf got a blunt reminder that despite his professed worship of things french he was specifically an african and african he would remain on may 13 2006 as he was responding to the canadian governments invitation to speak in winnipeg on matters relating to the pseudoapolitical francophonie abdou diouf this easily recognizable towering political figure who travels with adiplomatic passport and a strong following was stopped and body searched at toronto airport thediplomatic reactions that followed this humiliation of an african politician proved beyond all doubts that francité or francophonie as it is often referred to was more political than its supporters knew or would admit to know president dioufs humiliation at toronto airport was only symptomatic of the duplicitous nature of the northsouth encounter a reality to which africans have never been able to respond in a synchronized waybecause of the norths successful politics of divide and rule and most importantly because of africanleaders big complex of inferiority while senegalese the most fervent believers of francité in africa wereprotesting their expresidents treatment at toronto airport many ivorians were chuckling at what theyperceived as a fair shock therapy to all the frenchafrican puppets who like the senegalese sharpshootersof world war ii were busy fighting frances war while the french populations were hiding in theirbasements or the modern native africans economic hit men who were starving their peoples by sellingoff their countries resources to international multinational corporation in order to enjoy a little bit of white dreams ivorians had trouble understanding why at the same time as paris with the support of some african leaders was prosecuting abidjans successive governments in the media for a socalledmaintenance of ivoirité the same african leaders were touring the world to promote francité as if francité was the natural expression of their own salvation francophone african leaders like bongo of gabon abdoulaye wade of senegal and toumani of mali had been more vociferous about frenchnationalistic interests than they had been supportive of their own national interests at least president bédié had been aware of culturalideological nature of the concept having sensed frances undeclared support for ouattara just before the 1995 presidential election bédié activated againstthe latter the ideological political dimension of ivoirité a modification of the electoral code of côtedivoire adopted on november 23 1994 stipulated that only ivorians whose parents were both ivorianborncould run for the presidency bédié took this new measure not out of the blue but precisely becausehe knew ouattara they were from the same generation they knew where each other came from they hadfollowed each others formation and ascent they had served for the same international financialinstitutions and they knew how and why each one of them was appointed at the various posts they held bédié knew ouattara as much as ouattara knew him bédié knew—and ouattara had admitted this in a signcorrespondence to the supreme court of côte divoire—that after his high school studies in bobo dioulasso burkina faso and ouagadougou burkina faso ouattara had benefited from an american scholarship to study in the us as a student from upper volta now burkina faso bédié knew that after hisstudies in the us ouattara first entered the imf in 1968 under upper volta quotas bédié knew that ouattara had obtained his first job at the beceao as an upper volta representative and later served asvicegovernor of the same institution between 1982 and 1984 as a functionary of upper volta burkina faso apparently bédié was not the only one in the secret for on august 8 1984 on page 21 of an articleentitled monsieur fmi béchir ben yamhed the editorial manager of jeune afrique reported thatstarting november 1 1984 the africa department of the imf was going to have a new director and that dr ouattara from upper volta would be serving in replacement of zambian justin b zulu the jeune afrique article even specified that ouattara was born in côte divoire of immigrant parents fromneighboring upper volta24 alassane ouattaras voltaic nationality was no secret to anyone especially as he exhibited it whenever it served his purpose having evolved in the same professional space as ouattara the sphere of international financial institutions bédié was well positioned to know as jeune afrique had reported the nationality of ouattara he was an upper volta citizen who took advantage of an american scholarship as an upper volta student he was first recruited at the imf under the quota reserved for upper volta citizens and later he served asvicegovernor of the bceao as a representative of upper volta with an upper volta diplomatic passport in 1985 after his military coup in upper volta thomas sankara the new strongman of burkina faso acountry that unlike houphouëts côte divoire was not in the business of appointing foreign citizens ascabinet ministers offered ouattara to enter his government as minister of economy and finances a postthat ouattara utterly resentful of sankaras revolution disdainfully rejected preferring to remain at hismore prominent and lucrative international position at the bceao sankara then asked him to resign as the upper volta representative it is at that time that houphouët who had a profound aversion for military regimes especially the ones operating too close to his borders intervened and in a taunting gesture toward sankaras junta offered ouattara an ivorian diplomatic passport that would keep him at his post25 in 1988upon the death of abdoulaye fadiga then bceao director houphouët twisted the arms of the memberheads of state and imposed ouattara as the new governor of the institution bédié knew as anotherjournalist of jeune afrique had also reported that from the time he finished his studies thanks to an american scholarship awarded to him as a voltaic student and for the many years to come ouattaraserved in many capacities in several places washington paris dakar at several financial institutions bceao wamu west african monetary union adb african development bank unctad united nations conference on trade and development and took part in many general assemblies as a voltaic citizen equipped with a voltaic diplomatic passport26 bédié knew that by modifying the electoral code to request that both parents of any presidential candidates be ivorianborn he was arresting ouattaraspresidential ambition which he did bédié was a cunningly shrewd politician for changing the electoral rules in the middle of the political process ouattara was right to have protested bédies unfair electoral practices however he challengedthem on the wrong ground it would have been more honorable of ouattara to admit that indeed he hadclaimed voltaic nationality to get a scholarship from the us and later to take advantage of an imf quotasystem that favored voltaic nationals but that he had changed his nationality since then and he could haveprovided documentation to that effect he could also have maintained that though his parents were voltaiche was born on ivorian soil and he could have challenged the ivorian electoral rule on the ground of hisbirthplace instead he told two momentous untruths that were totally undeserving of any prospectivepresident first he denied in the face of accumulating evidence that he had ever been a voltaic national hemaintained that as far as he could remember he had always had the ivorian nationality secondly he deniedthat his parents were voltaic while his father had been a wellknown village chief in upper volta thesetwo fabrications alone were good enough to disqualify any presidential candidate as bédies operativesstarted to produce proofs of ouattaras deceptions he left the country for paris under the pretext that his lifewas in danger bédies justice department launched against him an international warrant for forgery just immediately there started a vast media campaign that sought to legitimate any unconstitutional blow against the bédié regime a media campaign that resuscitated some of bédies formerly ignoredshortcomings or simply invented him new ones how does one rationalize a coup détat by conducting it the name of globalizationin côte divoire the first coup détat started with demonizing the bédié regime on two levels socially and politically bédié was to be presented as an insufficient leader who could not be the unifier and leader opento human and capital flows that his predecessor houphouët was economically he was to be proven areckless manager and an embezzler of public funds whose misconduct was hurting the masses so bédiesnotion of ivoirité served to demonize him as a divider and a xenophobic ivoirité as bédié had explainedwas a formulae meant to synthesize the aspirations of the multiple ethnic groups living within the borders of côte divoire as such the concept was to encompass not only the autochthonous people of côtedivoire but also the people from all over the world who lived and worked in the country insofar as theytoo shared and respected the values of the nationals for bédié ivoirité    la synthèse culturelle entre lesethnies habitant la côte d’ivoire    concerne en premier les peuples enracinés en côte d’ivoire mais aussiceux qui y vivent et y travaillent en partageant nos valeurs 27     the cultural synthesis of the ethnicgroups living in côte divoire    is primarily about the peoples rooted in côte divoire but also those wholive in the country and share our values nothing in these words could hint to some official antiimmigrantor xenophobic stance despite the fact that—and it has historically tended to be the case more in francethan in côte divoire—some frustrated fringes of the populations usually displace the inadequacies of their societies on the presence of foreigners nevertheless a powerful media campaign led by ouattaras operatives successfully disseminated the idea that bédies ivoirité was a recipe to repatriate immigrants from neighboring mali and burkina faso and anapparently credible french press went so far as to link minor occasional conflicts opposing locals toimmigrants as direct consequences of ivoirité thus further exacerbating limited clashes by politicizingthem it did not take long for a country with nearly a 30 immigrant population to be indexed asxenophobic however the french press real motive for demonizing bédies regime was elsewhere alassane ouattara frances preferred candidate could not run for the ivorian presidency on account of hisdoubtful nationality bédié is no saint one must admit he is only a politician and every act he posited waspolitically calculated ivoirité in its political reach could also serve not only to eliminate ouattaras chances at the presidency but also to contain the massive electorate from burkina faso and mali on which ouattara was counting to this effect and which fitted with ivorian national id cards since the 1970s had hitherto voted in every election this electorate was geographically from countries north of côte divoire and religiously more than 90 muslim ouattara wasted no time to coalesce topography and faith to hisadvantage launching this designed sentence from his selfimposed parisian exile on ne veut pas que jesois président parce que je suis musulman et nordiste they do not want me to be president because i am a muslim and a northerner thus instigating an interethnic and interreligious pandemonium there was no reason to link ouattaras disqualification to the fate of the five million immigrants that lived in côte divoire yet this is what a corrupt and irresponsible national and international media did for thepurpose of the denigration campaign that bédié was to undergo under the hostile media ouattara suddenlycondensed all that was foreign and muslim and any wrong done to him either proven or unprovenbecame automatically a wrong done to any of the five million immigrants or the northern muslims living in côte divoire equally any justice rendered him could be interpreted as justice rendered to the immigrantsor northern muslim populations of the country curiously however the selfprofessed certified media thatsupported ouattaras messianic campaign and was eager to impose him to ivorians as legitimate presidentglossed over his own admission that he studied with an american scholarship reserved to voltaic studentsand carried a voltaic passport until the age of 42 with a disconcerting carelessness and an unforeseen lack of journalistic rigor as one could read in lexpressa paris dans ce bureau de lagence immobilière que dirige son épouse française alassane ouattara qui admet avoir été boursier du gouvernement de hautevolta et détenteur dunpasseport voltaïque étale sur une tablette les copies des documents censés confondre sesdétracteurs cartes didentité parentales acte de naissance certificat de nationalité in paris in the office of the real estate agency that his french wife

critics wrong parentsidentity cards birth certificate certificate of nationality only journalists with premeditated purposes could be so blind as to pass over facts that begged so deafeningly for a minimum of objectivity objectivity however was far from being the primary concern in the design to topple bédié whoever has closely followed african politics on the other hand will know that african leaders are in their greatmajority corrupt officials strongly encouraged by greedy northern political and business operatives to stealfrom their peoples or to embezzle foreign aids with impunity insofar as these northern officials can besecured enormous benefits one will recall how former french president valérie giscard destaing and hiscronies allowed former central african republics emperor jean bedel bokassa to remain in power formany years so long as he permitted them to plunder the uranium and diamond mines of his country onewill also recall how successive french presidents from giscard destaing to jacques chirac closed theireyes on the financial follies of dictators like mobutu from congozaire bongo from gabon eyadema from togo papa and baby doc from haiti as long as these corrupt leaders made their countries the economicplaygrounds of french multinational corporations the rulers of côte divoire from houphouët to bédiépassing through ouattara and gueï have all treaded in the muddy waters of frances organized crimewhereby they would cede their countries resources to france under their market values in return for huge commissions that often came in the form of freedom to embezzle with assurance of no audits this is until the crooked leaders start acting like renegades bédié offers an interesting case study to this paradigm ofall the misappropriations of funds in which bédié and his close associates were involved there is one thathe would always remember the most as the scandal that helped kill his presidency between 1992 and 1997 the european union approved several grants to côte divoire which were earmarked to improving the healthcare system and supporting the countrys decentralization program mostof the aid vanished in government members bank accounts between 1992 and 1997 two differentgovernments had been in control in côte divoire the allpowerful government of prime minister ouattara 19901993—which under an ailing houphouët saw the prime minister cumulate the portfolios of interimpresident and finance minister with that of prime minister and the kablan duncans government under bédies presidency 19931999 though the member states of the european union acknowledged that themisappropriation of the european unions grants spanned over a fiveyear period which should include atleast one year of ouattaras administration curiously no mismanagement was imputed to the ouattaragovernment the reason for this was quite simple ouattara had been good to french business in particularand to european interests in general though at home much had been said and written on the illicit source ofhis huge personal fortune on his elitist style and on his arrogance toward the middle class that his blind support for the imf and the world banks forced structural adjustment was exponentially pauperizing bédié on the other hand was becoming an annoyance to france and to the european union in general his muchheralded reforms were not to the liking of france land reform threatened big french landownersespecially many who acquired their lands through deceitful means bédies project of identification byregulating the flow of immigration along the borders of côte divoire threatened frances own politics ofimmigration which sought to keep west africans away from french borders in particular and from european coasts in general for a long time côte divoire had been the basin of african immigration many west africans with dreams of better lives away from home who could have tried their luck in europehad settled in côte divoire and had found in the ivorian social and economic haven not only more thanthe economic prospects they could envisage in france but also better social political and religiousintegration than could be imagined in europe so long as these african immigrants could remain in côte divoire they were millions less souls for the european unions immigration systems to worry about furthermore bédies identification policy termed as ivoirité was susceptible of disqualifying frances greatest ally ouattara and thus killing frances hope of returning the state of côte divoire to the status ofnongovernmental organization ngo a status which though disadvantageous to the ivorian masses hadmade so many french businesses wealthy and frances balance of payments affirmative so five years afterpassively watching successive ivorian governments indulge among others in the spoliation of the european unions grants france was suddenly struck by some pang of conscience and decided to act on behalf of the oppressed masses that were being shortchanged by their leaders so france leading the european union ordered an audit of the management of the grants during 1995 and 1997 which was coincidentally the period concerning only the bédié government despite the widelyreported fact that the scandal traced as far back as 1992 that is as far back as the ouattara administration the audit of very limited scope undertaken by the european union though it appeared somehow commendable was in fact one more artifice in a series of carefully choreographed ruses meant to sully bédies government and justify any military blow to come the audit conducted in november and december 1998 by the audit firm 2ac uncovered that more than 30 millions of an 88 million packagehave gone missing this revelation coincided with the cologne germany announcement of debt reductionfor heavily indebted poor countries hipc and caused the european union to freeze its budgetary help to côte divoire the story of embezzlement of international aid by the bédié government made a big splashin europe and was disseminated by all the conceivable french major tv networks and newspapers nevertheless some voices in europe expressed suspicion about the timing of this revelation30 the experts of the european union could not have been blind to the embezzlement going on for five years they werewell aware of the misuse of fund they just chose to ignore it because the time was not right yet to blow thewhistle bédies misappropriation of international development aid from the european union became publiconly when came time to justify a coup against him the revelation of the scandal coincided with the timewhen the question of ouattaras nationality became a burning issue in ivorian politics culminating with ouattaras selfimposed exile in france now bédié had on his hands not only multiple notsopeacefuldemonstrations organized by ouattaras followers the ire of the world bank the imf and the european union but also the incensed populations of côte divoire prompted each day by a hostile national mediaand a french gregarious media that has always mechanically aligned itself with the international policy of french politicians a few weeks after ouattara turned up on the doorsteps of his parisian friends andpartners on december 24 1999 bédié was deposed by the military on january 3 2000 bédié went inexile in paris via lomé and went to live in his private apartments on rue beethoven in the luxurious 16th arrondissement ouattara as for him returned to abidjan triumphantly persuaded that robert gueï the new strong man of abidjan who had been his army chief of staff during his days as prime minister waswarming up the presidential seat for him ouattara was wrong general gueï decided to hold on to power he promised to maintain excellent relationships with france honor côte divoire financial obligationstoward the bretton woods institutions and return power to civilians as soon as he had swept the house and put things in order gueï must have been very reassuring and unthreatening for not a single time were there talks of french citizens being in danger in côte divoire none of the 20000 french nationals living in the country wasasked to leave by the french authorities how could they be in danger after all was not gueï close veryclose to ouattara was not ouattara himself the man of the imf and the world bank thus the man of france and of the west in general in fact respectable french newspapers like le monde and frenchradio stations like rfi were literally dispatching gueïs version of the coup presenting the despot as ahero who was forced by moral imperatives to take power in order to rectify injustices caused by bédié andwhile powerful african leaders like obasandjo of nigeria and mbeki of south africa saw no reason tojustify gueïs military coup and while they were strongly condemning the military overthrow in côte divoire as illegitimate and were calling for the restoration of bédies power france wasted no time through its minister of cooperation mr charles josselin to recognize the new praetorian regime and toannounce its willingness to work with gueï however gueï misinterpreted frances support as a support for him instead of temporary regency of ouattaras throne mysteriously the question of alassane ouattaras nationality which had been a stickingpoint during the bédié administration resulting in ouattara being disqualified from the 1995 presidentialrace and which according to gueï was at the foundation of the december 1999 coup against bédiéresurfaced on the occasion of gueïs presidential ambition like his predecessor general gueï pressed ouattara to settle the issue of his doubtful ivorian citizenship on september 12 2000 gueïs lawyersproduced some papers intended to disprove ouattaras assertion that he had never availed himself ofanother nationality among the papers exhibited were ouattaras marriage certificate to an american woman named barbara davis in which he declared himself a citizen of upper volta and stated at the time of marriage in 1966 that his mother was no longer living a fact that contradicted his earlier declarationthat his mother was a living eightyyearold ivorian woman by the name of hadja nabintou cissé therewere also a 1978 bank account document and of a 1980 property sale certificate in which ouattara declaredhimself to be a citizen of upper volta for gueï all these discrepancies spoke more of ouattarasimmorality and criminal mind than they could shed light on his honesty gueï threatened to charge ouattarawith falsification and once again the supreme court of côte divoire rejected ouattaras candidacy to the presidential election on the ground of suspicious nationality members of foreign press did not remain silent to this nth injustice perpetrated against the misunderstood savior of the ivorian flock and took it upon them to lecture the ivorian people about what great opportunitythey were missing by persecuting the great messiah come from the imf nevertheless unencumbered bythe criticisms of international media that have lost all credibility even in the rare cases where they happento get the news right general gueï barred ouattara from the october 22 2000 presidential election as aresult five contenders vied for the presidential seat general robert gueï for the military junta laurent gbagbo for the socialist party fpi francis wodié for the pit mel théodore for the udci and theindependent nicolas dioulo halfway through the ballot counting gueï attempted to load the dice to hisadvantage by stopping the count and declaring himself the winner while the early returns had gbagboleading the race gbagbos supporters took to the street to protest gueïs coup de force and with the support of the defense and security forces of côte divoire they drove gueï to hiding a few days later the supreme court declared gbagbo the winner of the presidential race with 5936 of the votes against327 for gueï 57 for wodié 15 for mel and 8 for dioulo ouattaras rdr contested the resultsdemanding that the election which saw only a 37 participation and did not include ouattara be redonethis time with ouattaras participation this protest by the rdr remains the damocles sword hovering over gbagbos presidency that would be used to rationalize all the conceivable coups bas laurent gbagbo thesaying goes was elected in calamitous conditions59 of the votes with a participation rate of only 37and above all without ouattara the darling candidate of france and of the bretton woods institutions hewho more than anyone else before made french multinationals in côte divoire so wealthy by selling themthe countrys strategic companies under the excuse of satisfying a world bankimf program called the washington consensus therefore against gbagbo all blows are permitted even the most contemptible ones hardly had gbagbo been sworn into office than accusations of ethnocentrism and xenophobia started flying his way and the crimes once imputed to bédié and gueï became his daily lot gbagbo had announced a program that disturbed french interests refondation reconstruction it is true that the greatestdistinguishing feature between imperial rule and independent government is the externality of the former in colonial societies the power to rule was taken away from local populations and entrusted to another statewith which these populations had absolutely nothing in common all happened as if the ability to decide acountrys destiny its collective mind had been cut out surgically and transplanted into another mind in london paris brussels the haye or washington31 a fact which in the franceafrica relationship andfor what concerns here in the francecôte divoire relationship had persisted throughout all thegovernments that had preceded the gbagbo administration gbagbo had decided that the transfer of powerthought and responsibility from côte divoire to the metropolis that had hitherto defined the franceafrica relation and made french african governments nongovernmental organizations at the sole service of frances interests with no regard to the interests of the ivorian people had to come to an end throughpolitical economic and social purgative refondation refondation was meant to dig into the foundation ofthe ivorian society in order to correct the structural flaws that were slowing or impeding progress and thusundermining the social growth of the ivorian people32 economically among other resolutions refondationwanted to review the terms of renewal of a number of conventions ceded to france multinationals undertheir market values by the ouattara government conventions the clauses of which french firms had hardlyabided by and which were to fortunately come to expiration around 2004 among these were theexploitation of côte divoire telecom conceded to france telecom the exploitation of côte divoires power eeci and water sodeci companies conceded to bouygues the exploitation of the railwaysystem conceded to bolloré and which was in dire need of modernization refondation also meantreassessing some construction contracts by which french firms were fleecing the ivorian economy byoverpricing their services for instance the contract of a third bridge to be built in abidjan was ceded to the french bouygues although a chinese company covec would build the same bridge for 13 of the priceand would accept part of payment as exchange in coffee and cocoa in a word economically speakingrefondation was to liberate the ivorian economy by doing away with france exploitative and manipulativefriendship which had not changed since the days of the colonial exclusif—this french policy whereby french colonies could only buy from france and sell to france at prices fixed by france—in order tostretch a hand to all who were willing to be partners of good faith rather than abusing speculators as hasusually been the case with france it was obvious that if such reassessing was to happen the pressureexerted by france on côte divoire cede all its development deals to french multinationals without any bidfor contracts would be fruitless and french firms would henceforth have to openly compete with othermultinationals american british canadian chinese japanese south african etc for a chance to obtaincontracts in côte divoire this could be economically hazardous for france especially as 2005 wasannouncing new privatizations such as the privatization of the ivorian oil refining company sir andnumber two ivorian cellular phone company telecel in an open competition french multinationalswhich have proven in the past to be driven by no other concerns but exponential returns at all cost would have very little chance of securing further contracts in côte divoire actually in an open competition french multinationals risked losing everything to americans british canadians or south african japanese or chinese perhaps after all refondations pretensions were only a tale the bluff of a nostalgic socialist out of touch with the realities of the moment perhaps france had nothing to fear from refondation as gbagbo hadpractically inherited a country on its knees a country that because of the disastrous politics of the pdci inthe previous forty years was more dependent than ever on international aid and especially on france without france its colonial and postcolonial guarantor where could refondation get the money it neededfor its program of development after all the devaluation of the cfa the depreciation of coffee andcocoa the countrys two major exports the european unions and the world bankimfs refusal to lend anymore money to côte divoire after the bédié administrations muchpublicized financial scandal had left côte divoire no other alternative than to be on the good side of france which could then intercede withinternational financial institutions to garner some muchneeded loans and grants on behalf of abidjan gbagbo could not be serious he could not run the risk of losing frances support at such a crucial momentby threatening french multinationals monopoly in côte divoire gbagbo had anticipated the dilemma ofnot receiving any external financial help to remedy it he initiated a measure of austerity that consisted inworking at eradicating poverty with a secured budget a budget that could not rely on any external help henamed it le budget sécurisé also he undertook to fight corruption in taxes and at the customs gbagbosdetermination earnestness and visible success caused the world bank to unconditionally return to doing business with côte divoire in 2002 the imf the european union and the african development bankfollowed suite this made it possible for abidjan to have the necessary financial resources to implement itsprogram of refondation frances fear started to materialize especially as to signal frances loss of esteem in côte divoire and refondations resolve to rectify its cooperation with france and with all partners for that matter a south african company had just beaten french bolloré at a bid for the construction of a newairport in san pédro southwest of côte divoire french multinationals had no intention of competingfairly with other countries in the past it had been easy for france to buy influences in french africa byfinancing the campaigns of politicians sympathetic to french interests or by bribing local officials refondation was undercutting this practice and leaving french multinationals which hitherto garneredenormous dividends for frances economy at the mercy of other international competitors france had nointention of loosening its grip on côte divoire the wealthiest former french colony in subsaharan africa furthermore côte divoires stance if left unchallenged could be infectious other french financial havens could start questioning the validity of their cooperation with france and should they like côte divoirehave the audacity to voice the anomalous makeup of that cooperation franceafrica relations could be ingreat danger of vanishing forever this was not about to happen for as koureyssi bâ observed so fittinglythe french policy in africa characterized by deceit lawlessness and violence remains unchanged nomatter which party is in power in paris furthermore france can always rely on the servile devotion of itspuppets and its docile locals informants who do not care about their legacy in history and who are ready todraw a dagger into the back of any brother who dares to say no to the master33 ouattara who had dreamedof being president of côte divoire at all cost had no problem driving the dagger in the back of laurent gbagbo france most annoying killjoy in africa convinced that france would back any subversive coupagainst gbagbo this is what ouattara had to say in 2001 to a freshly elected group of mayors from his party nous n’attendrons pas 5 ans pour aller aux élections après tout dans certains pays il y a des coups d’etat et lesgens s’accomodent bien de ces personnes pendant une certaine période nous avons des monarchies dans lemonde et les gens acceptent bien qu’une personne non élue représente le peuple dans sa totalité pourquoidevrionsnous attendre 5 ans pour que vous ayez ce à quoi vous avez droit et surtout ce que les populationsréclament  nous avons certaines relations extérieures nous avons commencé à les actionner j’aimerais vousdire aussi que nous avions convenu avec le maire adama que nous aurons des réunions périodiques pour qu’ensemble nous puissions développer assez rapidement une stratégie pour la conquête du pouvoir we will not wait 5 years to go to the elections after all in some countries there are coups détat and people getused to the situation after a while we have monarchies in the world and people accept that a person who has notbeen elected represent the country in its totality why should we wait 5 years before you get what you deserveespecially when the populations are asking for it we have external contacts we have started to activate them iwould also like to tell you that with mayor adama we have agreed to have periodic meetings so that very quickly we can all develop a strategy for the conquest of power so in the night of september 19 2002 france triggered one of its bloodiest punitive campaigns against côte divoire a group of deserters from the ivorian army who had been training in neighboring burkina faso simultaneously hit the cities of bouaké and abidjan with a brutality never experienced in the country more than 100 unsuspecting members of the ivorian defense forces in bouaké were executed in their bedsalong with their families scores of wandering civilians were shot emile boga doudou the ivorianminister of interior who had just returned from a visit to his french homologue sarkozy a day earlier avisit during which he had raised the question of ivorian deserters being trained in neighboring burkina faso was executed in his bed along with members of his family and his domestics general gueï theformer president and his wife were assassinated it was a night of carnage gary k busch has detailed the operational organization of that atrocious nightly attack on côte divoire in september 2002 about 650 rebels loyal to general robert gueï attacked both bouaké and abidjan from neighboring burkina faso while gbagbo was in rome to meet the pope their operation was supposed to last five days maximum they were hoping to seize power and force gbagbo to exile but they were illarmed and disorganized and soon the defense force of côte divoire cornered them and reduced them tohalf it was then that the commander of the french army in côte divoire requested a ceasefire so that hecould evacuate the french citizens and a few american nationals living in bouaké during the 48 hoursallotted the french army three antonov12 flew from franceville gabon to supply the rebels inarmament other planes and truck brought in armament and mercenaries from liberia and sierra leone and the rebel force which was previously estimated at 320 troops grew to 2500 mercenaries armed withkalachnikovs and other weapons that had never been part of the ivorian armory the french army alsosupplied the mercenaries with sophisticated communication equipments that kept them always aware of themovements of the ivorian defense troops the french then retreated gradually leaving the rebels in charge with eastern europeans mercenaries as technical advisers once the rebels were well positioned chirac then activated the international pressure machinery through the united nations to obtain a resolutionentrusting france with a peacekeeping mission in côte divoire35 while tergiversations were taking moretime than needed at the united nations the rebels were multiplying their fronts not just in the northern partof the country but also in the western parts recruiting more mercenaries from samuel does civil wartroops as well as mercenaries from the ruf in sierra leone the rebels indiscriminate killing and rapingof thousands of children elderly and women led to mass exodus toward yamoussoukro and abidjan gbagbo had dared to defy france and france had launched against his regime the biggest firepower everdelivered on côte divoire now the united nations through the security council could play its partition by blessing frances direct intrusion in the country yet gbagbos refondation was not merely a rumination posture against france evidently it intended to rectify côte divoires anomalous relationship with france the rosy economic definition of liberalizationthat treats foreign direct investment as    a decentralized process wherein each foreign company takesthe investment decisions of the others as beyond its control    is exploded in french africa therenothing is meant to remain beyond the control of french multinationals whose barons have vouched tofilter all nonfrench multinational investments access to the continent to the point of reducing them tonothing exploding is not just a figure of speech as the daily conflagrations caused by heavy frenchartillery and the frequent turning out of black corpses scare anglosaxon and asian investments out of french africa while france remains curiously present before during and after the cannon roars from theperspective of most french investors in africa foreign direct investment should have nothing to do witheach firm forming    an expectation about the host countrys eventual trade policy and evaluating the profitability of its own potential foreign investment accordingly instead the host country should be bombpressured to accepting the level of protection and the terms of profitability dictated by france it isunfortunate that in economic circles the kinds of quid pro quo foreign investments that have made frenchmultinationals and a few corrupt nationals wealthy while impoverishing most africans by a relocation oftheir economic resources are still treated as epiphenomenal or isolated episodes involving a small numberof disreputable industrialists french multinationals brutal practices in africa are systemic and they oughtto be examined as such the muchpublicized elfaquitaine affair has now shown that frenchmultinationals dirty economic practices run deep into the french government no matter which party is inpower gbagbos refondation was principally a program of poverty reduction through a distribution to themasses of healthcare and education services and the creation of jobs a program that fell well within the united nations millennium development goal mdg for africa the frenchsupported rebellion put gbagbos poverty reduction program at a standstill and the passion with which koffi anans united nations defended the french actions and supported frances subsequent direct intervention in côte divoirewas mindboggling the victim was presented as the victimizer and the victimizer was made both judgeand jury of the victim this collaboration of african leaders such as ouattara and kofi anan with a brutal european force against their people though revolting nevertheless has an explanation in all times africahas had local collaborators who enabled the exploitation and impoverishment of the continent by westernpowers so long as these local informants could be left to collect a few morsels alongside their plundering western masters at the time of the question of côte divoire kofi anan had his own scandals at the united nations hovering over his head and the oil for food humiliation in which his son using the fathersinfluence was deeply involved and for which anan needed france more than ever to testify on his behalf this could only happen if he took care of frances interests in africa no matter what the consequence could be for the african people anan and ouattara were only repeating an ancient gesture called northsouth collaboration unfortunately it would be utterly hypocritical for anyone who unreservedlycondemns the resistance organized by the ivorian patriotes to pretend to speak in favor of povertyreduction and growth in the third world and especially in côte divoire it is obvious that francesgangsterlike intervention in côte divoire has undermined progress by any theory of economics i shallpoint to some of the consequences of frances disquieting intrusion in côte divoire as they relate to thearmoring of the most pessimistic economics theories for the third world and the undercutting of all development theories ever to cast any promising outlooks on poor countries to proponents of dependency theory—the theory that winners and losers are two inevitable sides of the same coin of development the chiraquian martial incursion in côte divoire to protect lamenting frenchmultinationals terrified of international competitions makes factual the hypothesis that as economic tradegrows between rich and poor nations global income inequality grows too in the kind of liberal commercethat in the wake of the washington consensus has characterized the exchanges between côte divoireand france and in which the french government and the french army following an ageold tradition havefigured more like bullying middlemen than state institutions profits have been unashamedly unidirectional so this explaining that the convergence theory—the theory claiming that someday in a happy future the last shall meet the first and that rich countries will experience dwindling returns and be caught up by poorcountries is belied if the economic trends as we observe them today keep up convergence theorybecomes for the proponents of global equality wishful thinking an unrealizable fancy the impossiblepossibilization of convergence theory is pushed even further back into the dominion of bleakness by thedoing of rich countries that have specialized in altering in poor countries all the control variables in whichadvocates of endogenous growth have invested so much optimism how so against convergence theorists pessimistic outlooks for rich countries and optimistic perspectives for poorcountries proponents of endogenous theory would argue that humanity is only at the beginning of useful discoveries and therefore rich countries will always be able to subvert the menace of diminishing resources and remain dominant just by the significance of the scientific technological innovations that theymake at home this is possible because rich countries have traditionally been able to control certainvariables such as fertility rate level of human capital education and government spending thesecontrolled variables are referred to as conditional factors traditionally the control for these variables hasbeen absent in poor countries so then the factors that come to be known in rich countries as conditionalconvergence factors insofar as the conditions for their control are present become unconditionalconvergence factors in the third world insofar as the condition for their control are absent no onehowever would dispute the fact that conditional and unconditional convergence factors are not naturaloccurrences they do not respectively appear in rich and poor countries by devine design they are not the making of an omnipotent bigother who assigns them in that order to civilized capitalist societies on the one hand and to primitive territorial populations on the other hand conditional and unconditionalconvergence factors are not inherently attributed to one group of people who are in control of all theirintellectual faculties as opposed to another group subjected to lobotomy conditional and unconditionalconvergence factors are created and manipulated by greed ruthlessness and brutality which are notnecessarily signs of intelligence therefore before proponents of endogenous theory rest assured that anyresponsibility for failure and economic decline is entirely organic perhaps it would be wise to situateresponsibility on the levels of human capital and government spending the multiple muscled interventionsof france in west africa have always intentionally turned conditional and unconditional factors on theirheads in a theatrical diagram that made perfect sense for france while disturbing any prospect of planneddevelopment for the african nations this viciously masterful manipulation made conditional factorsunconditional for national social engineers while at the same time keeping them conditional for frenchbusiness bare hands victory becomes enlightening in disclosing frances responsibility in that regard but bakabas documentary can only expose the symptoms of a bigger infection in africa in bare hands victory côte divoire is but a case study of a more pervasive hexagonal will to power determined to makeprofits by all means necessary is it only by killing africas human capital that the rest of the world could give the black continent a chance of turning the tides of global inequality france seems resolved to spin the grim images of ivorian youthfalling under french multinationals hired guns into a neoclassical resolution of income inequality onewhich would eerily assert on account of the role of population growth in the race for development thatwe are saving them from themselves if growth is a race between increases in population and capitalstock this pessimisticoptimist argument would thus go then wars which have been more exogenousthan endogenous in french africa by their ensuing effects of population decrease will lead to betterdistribution of wealth in africa how depressing and how disingenuous too to link the slaughter of thedynamic and educated force of a country to its chances for progress in fact until an international outcryputs an end to the incendiary practices of the hired armies of imperial nations the butchering of the youngbrains of africa will continue to widen the technological gaps between north and south one of the major causes of global inequality and maintain an eastwestwesteastbound spread of technology andindustrialization it is not by accident that most third world countries claim appurtenance to the orient when they cannot establish their belonging to the occident have not theorists of economic geographytold us that the occident with its temperate climate and smoother terrains is blessed by the gods and hasall the best prospects for development nevertheless has african geography really been a hindrance at anytime in history for opportunists resolute to plunder the riches of the african continent have not europeanexplorers as far back as the sixteenth century defied the negative endowments of africa and pushed deepinto the heart of darkness to dig up africas iron ores its gold its diamond to cut its timber to bleed itsrubber trees to remove its elephants defenses to practice their shooting ability on its game have not european speculators designed ingenious methods to transfer africas human capital and riches to the occident despite africas muchheralded negative endowments why has europe become so paradoxicallyimpotent when it came to developing infrastructures in the continent that would benefit african populations and what to say of this socalled poor continent that yet continues to stir up so much interest in greedy multinationals geography and poverty have nothing to do with the underdevelopment of africa in fact to be fair africa is victim of
