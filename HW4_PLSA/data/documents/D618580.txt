and stigma creating acceptance of people living with hivaidshivaids bureau convenes hivaids stigma consultation practical steps to prevent hivrelated stigma and discrimination we have all seen the pictures on television ryan white was thrown out of school taunted by his neighbors and ostracized by his community all because he had aids people living with hivaids in the united states have been the targets of stigma since the first cases were diagnosed since then discrimination in the workplace in social settings and even in attempts to secure safe housing have created dire circumstances for those living with hiv disease this is not a problem confined to the united states globally with more than 42 million people living with the virus the effects of hivaids stigma exceed what most of us have the capacity to understand 1 in the united sates and around the world many communities punish people for simply revealing their hiv status an hiv diagnosis can cause family members neighbors and even medical providers to shun the hivinfected person a number of studies have provided evidence that stigma is associated with delays in hiv testing by people who are at high risk of being infected with hiv hivrelated stigma refers to unfavorable attitudes beliefs and policies directed toward people perceived to have hivaids as well as their loved ones associates social groups and communities the stigma is rooted in prejudices involving gender sexuality illness and race organizations serving people living with hiv disease face important questions regarding stigma how can they provide for patients who live with the very real threat of being ostracized how can they help individuals cope with stigma what can they do to help prevent or eliminate hivrelated stigma stigma what is it the wellknown social anthropologist erving goffman pioneered the study of stigma goffman is widely credited with providing the theoretical underpinnings that frame most stigma research in his landmark book stigma notes on the management of spoiled identity goffman described stigma as an attribute that is deeply discrediting within a particular social interaction 2 his explanation of stigma focuses on societys attitude toward people who possess attributes that fall short of public expectations according to goffman a person who is stigmatized is reduced in our minds from a whole and usual person to a tainted discounted one 3certain kinds of diseases carry more stigma than do others according to goffman and other researchers diseases associated with the highest degree of stigma share common attributes 4 5 6the person with the disease is seen as responsible for having the illness the disease is both progressive and incurable 7 8the disease is not well understood among the public the symptoms cannot be concealed hiv infection fits this profile first people infected with hiv are often blamed for their condition second although hiv is treatable it is nevertheless an incurable and progressive disease third hiv transmission is not well understood by many in the general population finally although asymptomatic hiv infection can often be concealed the symptoms of hivrelated illness cannot 9 hivrelated symptoms may be considered repulsive ugly and disruptive to social interaction hivrelated stigma manifests itself in a variety of ways which may be segmented into the following categories instrumental hivrelated stigma  a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness symbolic hivrelated stigma  the use of hivaids to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease 10courtesy hivrelated stigma  stigmatization of people connected to the issue of hivaids or hiv positive people 11 12the devaluation of identity and discrimination associated with hivrelated stigma do not occur naturally rather they are created by individuals and communities who for the most part generate the stigma as a response to their own fears hivinfected individuals their loved ones and even their caregivers are often subjected to rejection by their social circles and communities when they need support the most they may be forced out of their homes lose their jobs or be subjected to violent assault for those reasons hivrelated stigma must be recognized and addressed as a lifealtering issue hivaids stigma and the general population gregory m herek ph d a professor of psychology at the university of california at davis is an internationally recognized authority on hivrelated stigma prejudice against lesbians and gay men hate crimes and antigay violence as early as 1990 herek observed that people diagnosed with hiv are viewed more negatively than people diagnosed with other incurable diseases he also noted that gay men and injection drug users are disproportionately susceptible to hivrelated stigma and discrimination yet people who acquired hiv through no action of their own are often referred to as innocent or blameless 13 according to herek hivrelated stigma is not necessarily a stigma of the diseased rather it is often related to perceived lifestyle choices of infected populations or to perceptions about racial and ethnic minorities stigma may extend to professionals working on behalf of people with hiv disease as well as to volunteers and other caregivers hate crimes are criminal actions intended to harm or intimidate people because of their race ethnicity sexual orientation religion or other minority group status source herek gm gillis jr cogan j psychological sequelae of hate crime victimization among lesbian gay and bisexual adults j consult clin psychol 199967 6945951 a 1991 randomdigitdialing telephone survey conducted by herek and john capitanio sought to measure the extent of hiv stigma in the u s population the authors found that 271 percent of all participants had a stigmatizing response when asked if they felt angry towards people with aids when asked whether people living with aids should be separated from the general population 357 percent of the participants gave a stigmatizing response 14herek and capitanio conducted a similar followup telephone survey in 1992 and a third in 1997 the results suggested increasing levels of stigma and a hierarchy of blame regarding hivaids they wrote in our 1991 survey for example 205 percent of respondents agreed that people with aids have gotten what they deserve approximately 6 years later in the 1997 survey 288 percent agreed with the statement an increase of roughly 40 percent 15 and in 1997 even more respondents assigned some degree of responsibility when the question was framed less harshly the authors drew four major conclusions about hivaids in the united states most heterosexual adults surveyed equate aids with homosexuality or bisexuality and in turn harbor higher levels of prejudice much of the public continues to label people with aids as either blameworthy or innocent among those who contracted aids through sexual activity gay men are viewed more negatively than heterosexuals some portions of the public equate any samesex behavior with aids misconceptions about aids perpetuate the view that all homosexual behavior eventually leads to aids a substantial portion of the public harbors exaggerated fears about symbolic contact with hivpositive people such as touching an article of clothing worn by a person living with hiv disease these attitudes are most prevalent among people who harbor sexual prejudice 16following a 1999 telephone survey herek and colleagues concluded that some expressions of stigma declined during the 1990s 17 for example the proportion of people advocating the most drastic measures  quarantine and public identification of people living with hivaids  has significantly diminished however despite reductions in stigma onefifth of those surveyed in 1999 feared people with aids and onefourth felt uncomfortable having contact with people with aids another finding underscored the power of stigma to extend to the economic realm nearly onethird said they would avoid shopping at a neighborhood grocery known to be owned by a person with aids stigma and violence disclosure of hiv positivity may provoke violence in intimate relationships 18 19 sally zierler and colleagues studied hivpositive adults who had been assaulted by a partner or someone important to them since their diagnosis 20 the authors then examined the extent to which hiv status was a cause of the violence participants were a nationally representative probability sample of 2864 hivpositive adults who were receiving medical care and were enrolled in the hiv costs and service utilization study a total of 205 percent of the women 115 percent of the men who reported having sex with men and 75 percent of the heterosexual men said they had experienced physical harm since hiv diagnosis nearly half of those participants reporting a violent episode cited hiv seropositivity as the cause factors most strongly associated with violence were drug dependence homelessness and unemployment in another study herek and colleagues found greater psychological distress among victims of sexual orientationbased hate crimes than among victims of nonbiasrelated crimes 21 men and sexual minorities who are open about their sexual orientation are at higher risk for violence than are women or sexual minorities who try to conceal their sexual orientation stigma and the care system research devoted to stigma and access to care falls roughly into three categories barriers to care that hivpositive individuals encounter from hiv diagnosis to death the reluctance of health care providers to treat people with hivthe stigma experienced by providers of ancillary and support services to people living with hivaids a number of studies have provided evidence that stigma is associated with delays in hiv testing by people who are at high risk of hiv infection 22 23 for example in a study of gay and bisexual men who were unaware of their hiv status twothirds expressed a fear of discrimination against people with hiv and cited it as a reason for not getting tested 24given the magnitude of this pandemic one could hardly claim that the area of stigma reduction is well studied brown et al 2001 p 15 similarly a 2000 kaiser health poll found that onethird of survey respondents said that if they were tested for hiv they would be very or somewhat concerned that people would think less of them if they discovered they had been tested 25 eight percent of people who had never been tested for hiv said that worries about confidentiality played a part in their decision not to be screened over time studies have shown a decrease in severe reactions to being notified of positive test results however research indicates that notification is still associated with hiv stigmarelated distress after a person tests positive he or she faces many difficult issues including whether to disclose hiv seropositivity to partners friends family and health care providers as well as how to enter and adhere to care 26accessing health care can be a problem for people with hivaids because the health care system itself can be a source of stigma health care professionals particularly those who infrequently encounter people living with hivaids may be insensitive to stigmarelated concerns moreover procedures for maintaining patient confidentiality are not always in place and even where they are they are not always adhered to 27research from earlier in the epidemic revealed that health care providers fear of contagion and death can have negative effects on their attitudes toward and treatment of hivpositive patients health care providers also may fear stigmatization themselves because of their work with hivpositive patients 28 29 30 the prevalence of such fears may have declined over time but no evidence indicates that they have been eliminated volunteers as well as nonvolunteers consider hivaids volunteerism to be more stigmatizing than other forms of volunteerism 31 reports of having been embarrassed stigmatized or otherwise made uncomfortable in connection with their volunteer work are more common among hivaids volunteers than other types of volunteers 32 research supports the hypothesis that potential volunteers perceive hivaids volunteer work to be more stigmatizing than cancer volunteer work 33 such attitudes can be especially detrimental in the field of hiv care where volunteers have played a significant role since the onset of the epidemic interventions hivrelated stigma can negatively affect selfesteem and mental health while increasing the risk of discrimination and violence these factors can foster a reluctance to seek care hivaidsrelated stigma also fuels new hiv infections because it can deter people from getting tested for the disease make them less likely to acknowledge their risk of infection and discourage those who are hivpositive from discussing their hiv status with their sexual and needlesharing partners interventions to reduce hivrelated stigma are crucial for improving the care quality of life and emotional health of people living with hivaids moreover reducing stigma may actually help reduce new hiv cases the importance of hivrelated stigma interventions is highlighted in the joint united nations programme on hivaids publication a conceptual framework and basis for action hivaids stigma and discrimination which highlights several interventions in the international arena but laments the paucity of documented efforts to challenge hivaidsrelated stigma 34 this deficit is also noted by lisanne brown and her colleagues at the university of california at davis who wrote given the magnitude of this pandemic one could hardly claim that the area of stigma reduction is well studied 35most of the literature related to hiv stigma focuses on policy and regulatory concerns considerably less attention has been devoted to programmatic interventions which attempt to change attitudes and behavior this situation is regrettable because a multifaceted approach that goes beyond legal protections is necessary to change social climates that may legitimize discrimination 36legal and policy interventions in the early years of the epidemic a consensus emerged among public health officials that aids must be approached differently from other infectious diseases and sexually transmitted infections officials wanted to avoid stigma and mistreatment that could drive the epidemic underground which would compromise access to care and services deter or delay hiv testing and undermine the effectiveness of hiv prevention efforts officials promoted noncoercive prevention measures that respected the privacy and social rights of those who were at risk because no treatment for hivaids existed at the time mass education voluntary testing and counseling were the key elements in this public health strategy 37 38public health officials efforts did not prevent hivaidsrelated discrimination however despite legal precedents and protective legislation discrimination against people living with hiv as well as against those believed to be hivpositive has been reported in the areas of employment health care insurance and education ironically some institutional policies and laws designed to protect people with hiv from stigma can help perpetuate it for example privacy laws that aim to protect hivpositive people from stigma by keeping health information confidential may also contribute to the characterization of aids as a dirty little secret 39still legal protections are essential components of the societal response to stigma and discrimination 40 the recognition of the negative consequences of hivaids stigma prompted the enactment of statutory protections for people living with hiv disease the confidentiality of hivrelated information particularly hiv test results enjoys considerable protection under state laws and the u s constitution 41the 1990 americans with disabilities act ada expanded the reach of the rehabilitation act of 1973 and made discrimination on the basis of disability unlawful in bragdon v abbot 1998 the first discrimination case involving hiv infection or aids to reach the supreme court the court ruled that congress intended hiv infection to be included as a disability under the ada 42 43 hiv has been found to qualify as a disability under federal and state laws protecting the disabled from discrimination in employment housing government services and public accommodations such as hotels schools and medical offices 44program and service interventions in a review of 21 studies from developed and developing countries brown and colleagues analyzed the types of interventions that could help decrease hivrelated stigma 45 the review showed that stigma can be reduced through several intervention strategies information information can be delivered by advertisements brochures information packs classes or lecture presentations this approach frequently includes a factual description of the disease along with details regarding modes of transmission and methods of risk reduction counseling informationbased approaches are often combined with counseling eg support groups for people living with hivaids this strategy provides social reinforcement for positive attitudes behavior change and maintenance of safe behaviors participants receive personal support for resolving issues with spouses partners families and others in a safe environment coping skills acquisition master imagery and group desensitization are two techniques for acquiring coping skills in master imagery a person is presented with a hypothetical situation in which he or she has contact with an hivpositive person and is taught appropriate coping skills for resolving the situation group desensitization begins with relaxation training and then progressively exposes the individual or group to a number of situations involving people living with hivaids participants use the newly learned relaxation techniques to minimize tension during the hypothetical situation contact contact with hivinfected or affected individuals may be used alone or in combination with other strategies contact can create an environment in which the general population can interact with the stigmatized group either directly or vicariously eg through the media the theory is that increased personal contact with an hivpositive person will demystify and dispel misinformation generate empathy and in turn reduce stigma and prejudice contact can range from a facetoface conversation to hearing a testimonial from hivinfected or affected persons the stigmareduction interventions described above appear to work however most of the interventions were tested on a small number of subjects and few studies looked at whether changes in attitudes and behaviors were sustained over time today providers struggle to help those in care cope with hivaids stigma however knowing what should be accomplished and knowing how to make it happen are completely different issues research on hiv stigma is not comprehensive but providers may rely on several fundamental principles see box throughout history societies have stigmatized groups of all kinds for various reasons mostly as a result of ignorance misconceptions and superstitions aids is a disease  nothing more with time and education aids stigma may someday be seen as an artifact of a less enlightened time consequences of stigma deterioration of interpersonal relations negative emotions rejection of the hiv antibody test stress related to the hiding of the condition anxiety depression guilt loss of support isolation difficulties with family dynamics emotional or physical violence deterioration of relations with health care providers source hrsa and george washington university consultation meeting on stigma may 2223 2003 a comprehensive approach to stigma interventions to prevent hivrelated stigma and discrimination are integral components of the comprehensive approach to hivaids described by the new york state department of health aids institute the aids institute provides programs and services in applied settings including training for clinical and nonclinical providers consumer education social marketing approaches for communitywide education and awareness and support for consumer complaints for example the aids institute offers free training and clinical education programs that address prevention of stigma and discrimination the programs take place at locations throughout the state topics include hivaids confidentiality law cultural diversity domestic violence hiv testing procedures hiv reporting and partner notification gender identity and expression in communities of color and treatment education the new york state targeted provider education demonstration program funded by hrsahab builds capacity in minority organizations for education and training of health and human service providers celebrity disclosure and stigma in 1997 researchers examined earvin magic johnsons announcement that he was hiv positive to measure the effect of his disclosure on hivrelated stigma among the general public twowave randomdigitdialing national telephone surveys were conducted johnsons disclosure took place 3 weeks before wave ii results showed that respondents who were highly influenced by johnsons
