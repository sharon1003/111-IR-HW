exploitation what happens when there is a report of child abuseneglect once a report of child abuseneglect has been made there are various steps that are taken as part of the resolution process these steps generally involve californias cws system and the juvenile dependency process child welfare services system the cws system is run by the county welfare departments which investigate allegations of child abuseneglect and provide case management and support services to the children and their families the states cws program consists of four main components emergency response is the initial intake point for the program social workers are required to respond to reports of child abuseneglect and determine whether an inperson investigation is necessary family maintenance provides support services to prevent abuseneglect while the child remains in his or her home generally these services include counseling parent training respite care and temporary inhome care family reunification provides support services to the family while the child is in temporary foster care typically these services include counseling emergency shelter care parent training and teaching homemaking skills permanent placement provides management and placement services to children in foster care who cannot be returned to their families juvenile dependency process children who are served by the cws system generally come under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court which may decide that the child should be made a dependent of the court the juvenile dependency process involves a series of hearings and case reviews and may result in several outcomes such as foster care placement or adoption county welfare departments may offer services to children and their families without involving the juvenile dependency process when there is a voluntary agreement for such services between the family and the county welfare department the chart on the following pages shows the flow of a report of child abuseneglect through the child welfare system what happens when there is a report of child abuseneglect reports of child abuseneglect are received by county welfare departments through the emergency response component of the cws program in some cases the county social worker may determine that the child should be placed in temporary foster care a dependency petition is filed for each emergency response case that is not closed immediately requesting that the child be declared a dependent of the court a detention hearing is held to approve the temporary removal of the child from his or her home at the jurisdictional hearing the court determines whether or not abuseneglect has occurred as stated in the petition if abuseneglect was found a dispositional hearing is conducted to determine a remedygenerally the court may order family maintenance or family reunification services review hearings are held generally every six months to review family maintenance and family reunification efforts if family reunification efforts fail a permanency planning hearing is held to determine the longterm plan for the child the plan must include one of the following goals longterm foster care placement guardianship or adoption trends and characteristics of child abuse and neglect in california the state collects information regarding the incidence of child abuseneglect through reports made by county welfare departments it is difficult however to measure the actual incidence of child abuseneglect for several reasons first the definitions and guidelines used for determining child abuseneglect are not precise second some people may be reluctant to report child abuse or neglect because they do not want to become involved finally it may be difficult for government agencies to substantiate a report even though abuse or neglect has occurred in california the number of child abuseneglect reports per 1000 children increased 76 percent between 1985 and 1994 while this suggests that child abuseneglect has increased significantly data are not available on the number of reports that were actually substantiated that is where it was determined that abuse or neglect had occurred mandated reporters account for over half the reports of abuseneglect january 1993the california child abuse reporting law requires certain professionals to report known or suspected child abuse legally mandated reporters include certain employees of schools such as teachers or day care facilities health practitioners physicianurses clinical social workers child protective agencies county welfare probation police departments and commercial film and photographic print processors based on data from january 1993 54 percent of the reports came from legally mandated reporters the single largest source of all reports  about onefifth of the total  were made by schools who are the victims and perpetrators of child abuseneglect january 1993physical or sexual abuse account for half the reports of abuseneglect1994in 1994 about half of the reports of abuseneglect were due to physical abuse 32 percent or sexual abuse 17 percent about onethird of the reports were due to general neglect such as regularly leaving a young child in the home without supervision this distribution of the types of reported abuseneglect has remained generally constant over the last ten years reports of abuseneglect increased significantly during the late 1980s between 1985 and 1989 the number of reports of abuseneglect increased 70 percent from 42 to 71 per 1000 children since 1989 however the rate has increased more slowly the sharp increase in the late 1980s may have been partly due to an increase in the number of children born with drugexposure problems these cases were generally reported to cws until 1990 when legislation was enacted which restricted conditions for reporting the increase in reporting rates over this entire period is due to 1 increased incidents of child abuseneglect as a result of increased economic pressures on families 2 increased use of illegal drugs and 3 greater public awareness of child abuseneglect in total there were about 296000 reports of child abuseneglect in 1985 compared to about 664000 in 1994 this represents a 124 percent increase over the period or an average annual rate of almost 10 percent california has the highest rate of reported abuseneglect among the ten largest states1993in 1993 california had the highest rate of reported abuseneglect among the ten largest states76 per 1000 children the variation among the states is partly due to differences in reporting laws data collection systems and definitions of child abuseneglect for example pennsylvania does not include general neglect in its definition of child abuseneglect rate of reported abuseneglect varies among counties1994of the ten largest counties san diego couëïxônty had the highest rate of reported abuseneglect in 199450 percent higher than the statewide average in 1991 the countys reporting rate was almost 90 percent higher than the statewide average riverside county had the lowest reporting rate in 1994 which was 40 percent below the statewide average some variation may be due to differences in demographics for example incidence of poverty or differences in methods of data collection however these two factors do not appear to explain all of the variation law enforcement involvement in child abuse cases most common stress factors in abusive households january 1993research suggests that risk factors for child abuseneglect include poverty unemployment alcoholdrug abuse history of child abuseneglect or violence in the family limited support systems such as family and friends low selfesteem and poor health of parent based on a survey of cws cases in january 1993 the most common stress factors present in households experiencing child abuse were the inability to cope with parenting 35 percent of the cases and disruption of family
