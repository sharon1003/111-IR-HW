leishmaniasis leishmaniasis definition leishmaniasis refers to several different illnesses caused by infection with an organism called a protozoan description protozoa are considered to be the most simple organisms in the animal kingdom they are allsinglecelled the types of protozoa that cause leishmaniasis are carried by the bloodsuckingsandfly the sandfly is referred to as the disease vector simply meaning that the infectiousagent the protozoan is carried by the sandfly and passed on to other animals or humans in whom the protozoan will set up residence and cause disease the animal or human in which theprotozoan then resides is referred to as the host once the protozoan is within the human host the humans immune system is activated to try to combat the invader specialized immune cells called macrophages work to swallow up theprotozoa usually this technique kills a foreign invader but these protozoa can survive andflourish within macrophages the protozoa multiply within the macrophages ultimately causingthe macrophage to burst open the protozoa are released and take up residence within otherneighboring cells at this point the course of the disease caused by the protozoa is dependent on the specific type of protozoa and on the type of reaction the protozoa elicits from the immune system there areseveral types of protozoa that cause leishmaniasis and they cause different patterns of diseaseprogression at any one time about 20 million people throughout the world are infected with leishmaniasis between one million and one and onehalf million cases of cutaenous leishmaniasis are reportedyearly worldwide while leishmaniasis exists as a disease in 88 countries on five continentssome countries are hit harder than others these include bangladesh india nepal sudanafghanistan brazil iran peru saudi arabia and syria other areas that harbor the causativeprotozoa include china many countries throughout africa mexico central and south americaturkey and greece although less frequent cases have occurred in the united states in texas as americans travel to these countries they will come in contact the protozoa that cause forms of leishmaniasis also physicians were advised in 2004 to suspect cutaneous leishmaniasis in military personnel who were deployed to areas where the infection is present from august 2002 to february 2004 staff from the u s department of defense identified 522 confirmed cases of the disease in american military personnel in some areas of southern europe leishmaniasis is becoming an important disease that infectspeople with weakened immune systems in particular individuals with acquiredimmunodeficiency syndrome  aids are at great risk of this infection causes and symptoms there are a number of types of protozoa that can cause leishmaniasis each type exists in specific locations and there are different patterns to the kind of disease each causes the overallspecies name is leishmania commonly abbreviated l the specific types include l donovani l infantum l chagasi l mexicana l amazonensis l tropica l major l aethiopica l brasiliensis l guyaensis l panamensis l peruviana some of the names are reflective of thelocale in which the specific protozoa is most commonly found or in which it was first discovered localized cutaneous leishmaniasis this type of disease occurs most commonly in china india asia minor africa the mediterranean basin and central america it has occurred in an area ranging from northern argentina all the way up to southern texas it is called different names in different locationsincluding chiclero ulcer bush yaws uta oriental sore aleppo boil and baghdad sore this is perhaps the least drastic type of disease caused by any of the leishmania severalweeks or months after being bitten by an infected sandfly the host may notice an itchy bump lesion on an arm leg or face lymph nodes in the area of this bump may be swollen withinseveral months the bump develops a crater ulceration in the center with a raised reddenedridge around it there may be several of these lesions near each other and they may spread intoeach other to form one large lesion although localized cutaneous leishmaniasis usually heals on its own it may take as long as one year a depressed lightcolored scar usually remainsbehind some lesions never heal and may invade and destroy the tissue below for examplelesions on the ears may slowly but surely invade and destroy the cartilage that supports theouter ear diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis this type of disease occurs most often in ethiopia brazil dominican republic and venezuela the lesions of diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis are very similar to those of localized cutaneousleishmaniasis except they are spread all over the body the bodys immune system apparentlyfails to battle the protozoa which are free to spread throughout the characteristic lesionsresemble those of the dread biblical disease leprosy mucocutaneous leishmaniasis this form of leishmaniasis occurs primarily in the tropics of south america the disease beginswith the same sores noted in localized cutaneous leishmaniasis sometimes these primarylesions heal other times they spread and become larger some years after the first lesion is noted and sometimes several years after that lesion has totally healed new lesions appear in the mouth and nose and occasionally in the area between the genitalia and the anus theperineum these new lesions are particularly destructive and painful they erode underlyingtissue and cartilage frequently eating through the septum the cartilage that separates the twonostrils if the lesions spread to the roof of the mouth and the larynx the part of the wind pipewhich contains the vocal cords they may prevent speech other symptoms include fever weight loss and anemia low red blood cell count there is always a large danger of bacteriainfecting the already open sores visceral leishmaniasis this type of leishmaniasis occurs in india china the southern region of russia and throughout africa the mediterranean and south and central america itis frequently called kalaazar or dumdum fever in this disease the protozoa use the bloodstream to travel to the liver spleen lymph nodes andbone marrow fever may last for as long as eight weeks disappear and then reappear again the lymph nodes spleen and liver are often quite enlarged weakness fatigue loss of appetite diarrhea and weight loss are common kalaazar translates to mean black fever the name kalaazar comes from a characteristic of this form of leishmaniasis individuals withlightcolored skin take on a darker grayish skin tone particularly of their face and hands a variety of lesions appear on the skin diagnosis diagnosis for each of these types of leishmaniasis involves taking a scraping from a lesionpreparing it in a laboratory and examining it under a microscope to demonstrate the causativeprotozoan other methods that have been used include culturing a sample piece of tissue in a laboratory to allow the protozoa to multiply for easier microscopic identification injecting a mouse or hamster with a solution made of scrapings from a patients lesion to see if the animaldevelops a leishmaniasislike disease and demonstrating the presence in macrophages of thecharacteristicappearing protozoan called leishmandonovan bodies in some forms of leishmaniasis a skin test similar to that given for tb may be used in thistest a solution containing a small bit of the protozoan antigen cell marker that causes thehuman immune system to react is injected or scratched into a patients skin in a positivereaction cells from the immune system will race to this spot causing a characteristic skinlesion not all forms of leishmaniasis cause a positive skin test however treatment the treatment of choice for all forms of leishmaniasis is a type of drug containing the elementantimony these include sodium sitogluconate and meglumin antimonate when these types of drugs do not work other medications with antiprotozoal activity are utilized includingamphotericin b pentamidine flagyl and allopurinol in 2004 it was reported that the worlds firstnonprofit drug company was seeking approval in india for a drug to cure visceral leishmaniasis an estimated 200000 people die annually from the disease in that country the company called one world health hoped to offer the drug called paromomycin for a day for a threeweektreatment course prognosis the prognosis for leishmaniasis is quite variable and depends on the specific strain of infectingprotozoan as well as the individual patients immune system response to infection localizedcutaneous leishmaniasis may require no treatment although it may take many months theselesions usually heal themselves completely only rarely do these lesions fail to heal and becomemore destructive disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis may smolder on for years without treatment ultimatelycausing death when the large open lesions become infected with bacteria mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is often relatively resistant to treatment untreated visceralleishmaniasis has a 90 death rate but only a 10 death rate with treatment prevention prevention involves protecting against sandfly bites insect repellents used around homes on clothing on skin and on bednets to protect people while sleeping are effective measures reducing the population of sandflies is also an important preventive measure in areas whereleishmaniasis is very common recommendations include clearing the land of trees and brush for at least 984 ft 300 m around all villages and regularly spraying the area with insecticides because rodents often carry the protozoan that causes leishmaniasis careful rodent controlshould be practiced dogs which also carry the protozoan can be given a simple blood test resources periodicals mac ready norma leishmaniasis hits military hot spots internal medicine news june
