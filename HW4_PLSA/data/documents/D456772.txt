gouda and baby boerenkaas photo © richard nebeskyroberthardinggetty images its hard to imagine holland without its lush green pastures and blackandwhite frisian cows which have become as much part of the clichéd dutch identity as clogs windmills and tulips but thats perhaps not all that surprising when you consider that the dutch have been making cheese since 400 ad nowadays the netherlands is the largest exporter of cheese in the world with a dairy industry valued at over euro 77 billion dutch cheese varieties while the following list is by no means exhaustive it offers an overview of the most important types of dutch kaas cheese as well as a few varieties we think are worth seeking out gouda almost half of the cheese production in holland is devoted to this iconic cheese making it the netherlands most important and bestknown cheese gouda is a semihard cheese with a 48  milk fat content and a mild to piquant taste ageing intensifies the flavor and hardness gouda usually comes in

first milkings after the cows return to the grassy polders from a winter spent inside the fresh springtime grasses lend the 1 month old cheese a rich creamy texture and naturally yellow color when graskaas is only aged for up to 1 week it has a milky color and is called meikaas jonge kaas aged for 4 weeks and jong belegen kaas 2 months are wellsuited for sandwiches and go great with dutch grain mustard other goudas are fantastic for cooking try extra belegen aged for 78 months if youre looking to substitute jack or cheddar cheeses the oldest varieties such as oude kaas aged for at least 10 months and overjarig 1 to 2 years are excellent for eating in crumbly shards with a drizzle of dutch apple syrup for the truly authentic article  its even protected by the slow food ark of taste  look

cheese leidsekaas  komijnekaas the city of leiden was once known for its butter industry and leidsekaas was originally made from skim milk a byproduct of butter production this is why this type of cheese has a lower fat percentage than gouda cheese generally ranging from 2040 the lowfat dry and salty nature of this cheese made it exceptionally well suited to the vocs long ship voyages to the east in the 17th century where it could be easily stored without refrigeration for long periods of time it is thought that cumin seeds were added to counteract the salty taste the original cumin cheese from leiden is crumbly piquant and somewhat tart it is aged for at least 6 months further ageing intensifies the cumin flavor literally farmers leiden cheese has a dark red rind with the leiden city crest keys on it because of the differences in fat percentage and its eu protected designation of origin pdo not all cumin cheeses may be labelled leidsekaas in fact some cumin cheeses are simply
