or watercress purees although the dish was tasty overall i found the sauce to be very sweet  too sweet i think there are recipies out there for short ribs that have a better balance of flavors than this one not a repeat recipie for meebutvila from chicago il  flag if inappropriate never knew what sunchokes even were but i am now making it a staple lots of flavor would recommend you have a good cream based soup recipe to use the leftover creambutter from soaking sunchokes there is a lot left over and you can make a great soup for a starter for this dish mgmatt01 from louisville ky  flag if inappropriate its a crazy good braising liquid but the really crazy thing is i had all the ingredients in my panty awesome flavors made mashed potatoes using truffle salt and oil and smashed peas instead of watercress husband loved it will definitely do make this againkatie armstrong from honolulu  flag if inappropriate i would love to make this but 2 tablespoons black truffles really at 300 a pound anyone tried substituting truffle oil with less trufflesgenendel1 from mc lean va  flag if inappropriate i have just discovered that sunchokes are jerusalem artichokes dash it the season has finished i shall have to wait until next year unless i can find a way round everything i am a bit perplexed because the jerusalems and the chanterelle are in completely different seasonsgillyflower from st girons france  flag if inappropriate sunchokes are a type of artichoke people has no one heard of goofle eitherlittlestar  flag if inappropriate i am with gillyflower what is a sunchoke is it known by another namemargcruz54 from littleton co  flag if inappropriate im breaking my own rule that i dont rate a recipe that i havent made but leave a negative review by saying that you live in the sticks because of the gourmet ingredients prompted my rebuttal i cook comfort foods but once in a while its fun for me to learn new recipes and play with new ingredients yes i have a whole foods nearby where i can find these ingredients why the hate if these ingredients arent available then this recipe isnt for you this is a pricey dish to make but my husbands birthday is coming up the ingredients sound fantastic so i will make this and write a real review sorry for the rant but i though that was a rude comment left by judy 595 foodie wife from monterey ca  flag if inappropriate i havent made this recipe either and i live in the sticks too however i live in a country where in season i can find watercress its the season for mushrooms and i see chanterelles often demi glace and tamarind also no problem but what isare sunchokes im going to have a go however well i will when my printer is working im looking forward to it im off to the kitchen to make epicurious mussels in white winegillyflower from st girons france  flag if inappropriate i havent made this recipe but just looking at the title of the dish i know i could never make this sunchokes chanterelles watercress really i live in the sticksjudy595 from gabriels ny  flag if inappropriate i was only able to make the ribs and watercress puree as sunchokes are out of season i made a purple cauliflower puree instead and it was perfect i had to make several substitutions  no luck finding demi glace or tamarind paste so i used 14 cup white vinegar and made beef gravy for the glace while not as good im sure as the original it was still wonderful and i will make it again with all the ingredients it was easy to put together and the meat was off the bones by the time i got it out of the pothugheslh13 from
