due to their ionic characteristics and dipolar attributes each particle dispersed in a solution is surrounded by oppositely charged ions called the fixed layer outside the fixed layer there are varying compositions of ions of opposite polarities forming a cloudlike area this area is called the diffuse double layer and the whole area is electrically neutral when a voltage is applied to the solution in which particles are dispersed particles are attracted to the electrode of the opposite polarity accompanied by the fixed layer and part of the diffuse double layer or internal side of the sliding surface zeta potential is considered to be the electric potential of this inner area including this conceptualsliding surface as this electric potential approaches zero particles tend to aggregate the static layer is computed using the following formula which is embedded in the zeecom software hsb   13 128pi5k  12 this zeecom unit uses a microscope to observe particle electrophoresis migration on a monitor while performing image processing to determine the particle migration speed which is then converted into the zeta potential value to eliminate errors due to electroosmotic flow caused by any electrostatic charge on the measurement cell the zeta potential is measured at the static layer whose position can be calculated from the width and depth of the cell the software performs this calculation automatically the zeta potential is the overall charge a particle acquires in a specific medium the magnitude of the zeta potential gives an indication of the potential stability of the colloidal system if all the particles have a large negative or positive zeta potential they will repel each other and there is dispersion stability if the particles have low zeta potential values then there is no force to prevent the particles coming together and there is dispersion instability a dividing line between stable and unstable aqueous dispersions is generally taken at either 30 or 30m v particles with zeta potentials more positive than 30m v are normally considered stable particles with zeta potentials more negative than 30m v are normally considered stable zeta potential is a measure of the magnitude of the repulsion or attraction between particles its measurement brings detailed insight into the dispersion mechanism and is the key to electrostatic dispersion control the measurement of zeta potential is an extremely important parameter across a wide range of industries including brewing ceramics pharmaceuticals medicine mineral processing and water treatment malvern instruments zetasizer systems provide objective scientific measurements to help match experience to performance by measuring fundamental parameters known to affect stability – such as zeta potential particle size p h and conductivity investigators can identify measure and vary the parameters that determine stability when a new suspension or emulsion is formulated one of the biggest consumers of time is the measurement of the stability of the candidate formulations in a variety of conditions zeta potential can be used to test candidate formulations to reject poor examples at an early stage reducing the cost of the stability study this can also lead to an understanding of the mechanisms of stability and hence help with research into product quality improvements new formulations of products are required for a number of reasons legislation changes unavailability or increase in cost of components environmental issues or other political or market forces speed of introduction of new formulations is the key to product success measurement of zeta potential is one of the ways to shorten development times many industries use large quantities of water which become contaminated during the production process dewatering is now becoming important as the cost of disposal increases measurement of zeta potential can be used to optimize the use of expensive flocculants

ago0 0 comment zeta potential is an abbreviation for electrokinetic potential in colloidal systems in the colloidal chemistry literature it is usually denoted using the greek letter zeta hence ζpotential from a theoretical viewpoint zeta potential is electric potential in the interfacial double layer dl at the location of the slipping plane versus a point in the bulk fluid away from the interface in other words zeta potential is the potential difference between the dispersion medium and the stationary layer of fluid attached to the dispersed particle zeta potential units are m v the value of 25 m v can be taken as the boundary that separates lowcharged surfaces from highlycharged surfaces the significance of zeta potential is that its value can be related to the stability of colloidal dispersions colloids with high zeta potential negative or positive are electrically stabilized colloids with low zeta potentials tend to coagulate or flocculate as outlined in the table 1 zeta potential m v stablity behaviour of the colloid from 0 to ±5 rapid coagulation or flocculation from ±10 to ±30 incipient instability from ±30 to ±40 moderate stability from ±40 to ±60 good stability more than ±61 excellent stability zeta potential is widely used for quantification of the magnitude of the electrical charge at the double layer however zeta potential is not equal to the stern potential or electric surface potential in the double layer such assumptions of equality should be applied with caution nevertheless zeta potential is often the only available path for characterization of doublelayer properties zeta potential should not be confused with electrode potential or electrochemical potential because electrochemical reactions are generally not involved in the development of zeta potential colloidal particles dispersed in a solution are electrically charged due to their ionic characteristics and dipolar attributes each particle dispersed in a solution is surrounded by oppositely charged ions called the fixed layer outside the fixed layer there are varying compositions of ions of opposite polarities forming a cloudlike area this area is called the diffuse double layer and the whole area is electrically neutral when a voltage is applied to the solution in which particles are dispersed particles are attracted to the electrode of the opposite polarity accompanied by the fixed layer and part of the diffuse double layer or internal side of the sliding surface zeta potential is the electrical potential that exists at the shear plane of a particle which is some small distance from its surface zeta potential is derived from measuring the mobility distribution of a dispersion of charged particles as they are subjected to an electric field mobility is defined as the velocity of a particle per electric field unit and is measured by applying an electric field to the dispersion of particles and measuring their average velocity depending on the concentration of ions in the diluent either the smoluchowski for high ionic strengths or huckel for low ionic strengths equations are used to obtain the zeta potential from the measured mobilities zeta cuvette cell with electrodes particles scattered light particles and laser beam not to scale caption charged particles in a liquid suspension can be made to move by applying an electric field to the liquid through two electrodes by alternating the charge between the electrodes the particles move back and forth between the electrodes at a velocity relative to their surface charge and the electrode potential this velocity can be determined by measuring the doppler shift of laser light scattered off of the moving particles the nicomp 380zls uses the method of electrophoretic light scattering els to measure zeta potential to make a measurement a small aliquot of sample is typically placed in a disposable plastic cuvette then the platinum electrodes are inserted the entire cell is placed into the nicomp 380 because of the unique cell design there is no need to align the cell to the stationary plane after the cell is in place a simple click of the mouse starts the measurement since els requires the use of heterodyned light the scattered light must be properly mixed with a reference beam split off from the incident light beam prior to entering the detector the software will begin a measurement by automatically adjusting the incident light intensity to optimize the mixing between the scattered light and the reference beam once this is completed a reference power spectrum is measured while the electric field is off then the electric field is applied and another power spectrum is measured the change in the frequency of the peak in this power spectrum when compared to the reference spectrum is the doppler shift the doppler shift is used to calculate the average mobility using the smoluchowski equation the zeta potential is
