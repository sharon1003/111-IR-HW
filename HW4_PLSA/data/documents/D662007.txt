gwen davenport novel belvedere which in turn was thrice adapted to the big screen like its earlier novel and bigscreen brethren mr belvedere featured british butler lynn belvedere who takes a job as a livein nanny for a typical american family and records their everyday experiences in his diary for future use in writing a novel in the 1985 smallscreen version the owens family served as that typical american family and the source of fodder for belvedere who had previously worked as a gentry for winston churchill and had connections to british royalty family patriarch george played by sportscaster

add the first question user reviews the ultimate movie review  httptss5078blogspotcom  tss50789 march 2016  by tss5078 – see all my reviews now days most people only recognize mr belvedere as a frequent butt of family guy jokes on the surface it was just another 80s sitcom one of the founding members of abcs classic tgif lineup but for those of us who have come to love this show we realize that it was so much more mr belvedere is an english butler who was created in a 1947 novel starred in a 1948 movie and modernized for television in 1985 the show centers on lynn belvedere christopher hewitt a british royal butler who has been hired to work for a middle class family in suburban pittsburgh most of the time its your every day run of the mill sitcom but what made this show extremely different was its very special episodes which occurred several times a season the show ran from 19851990 yet it still managed to be the first television show to tackle issues such as aids bullying stranger danger elder rights and even homosexuality often times the family would come into conflict and face three choice mrs owens who always does the right things mr owens who never does the right thing and mr belvedere the voice of reason that lies somewhere in the middle as for the cast they are as unique and strange a mix as ever seen on television the main sources of comedy come from mr belvedere played by christopher hewitt between known for his performances on broadway than anything else and his dealings with wesley t owens brice beckham who is as twisted and psychotic as any sitcom child could ever be mr belvedere has frequent runins and a contentious relation with head of the household george played by bob uecker a former baseball player which usually lead to some quick one liners and even more laughs mr belvedere was really ahead of its time and extremely underrated as far as television history is concerned it may forever be remembered as that show with the butler that led into full house but for it me it has always been an image of how the not so perfect family should function and work together it is a mixture of laughter tears and life lessons that is as relevant today as it was back then2 of 2 people found this review helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report this review this title  see all 9 user reviews »getting started  contributor zone
