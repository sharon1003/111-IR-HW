supreme court police other countries law portalv t e the supreme court of the united states sometimes colloquially referred to by the acronym scotus 2 is the highest federal court of the united states established pursuant to article three of the united states constitution in 1789 it has ultimate and largely discretionary appellate jurisdiction over all federal courts and state court cases involving issues of federal law plus original jurisdiction over a small range of cases in the legal system of the united states the supreme court is generally the final interpreter of federal law including the united states constitution but it may act only within the context of a case in which it has jurisdiction the court may decide cases having political overtones but does not have power to decide nonjusticiable political questions and its enforcement arm is in the executive rather than judicial branch of government according to federal statute the court normally consists of the chief justice of the united states and eight associate justices who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate once appointed justices have lifetime tenure unless they resign retire or are removed after impeachment though no justice has ever been removed 3 in modern discourse the justices are often categorized as having conservative moderate or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation each justice has one vote and it is worth noting that while a far greater number of cases in recent history have been decided unanimously decisions in cases of the highest profile have often come down to just one single vote thereby exposing the justices ideological beliefs that track with those philosophical or political categories the court meets in the supreme court building in

united states constitution established the supreme court in 1789 its powers are detailed in article three of the constitution the supreme court was the only court specifically established by the constitution while all other federal courts were created by congress congress is also responsible for conferring the title of justice to its members who are known to scold lawyers for inaccurately referring to them as judge even though it is the term used in the constitution 4the court first convened on february 2 1790 5 with six judges where only five of its six initial positions were filled according to historian fergus bordewich in its first session  the supreme court convened for the first time at the royal exchange building on broad street a few steps from federal hall symbolically the moment was pregnant with promise for the republic this birth of a new national institution whose future power admittedly still existed only in the eyes and minds of just a few visionary americans impressively bewigged and swathed in their robes of office chief justice john jay and three associate justices — william cushing of massachusetts james wilson of pennsylvania and john blair of virginia — sat augustly before a throng of spectators and waited for something to happen nothing did they had no cases to consider after a week of inactivity they adjourned until september and everyone went home 6the sixth member james iredell was not confirmed until may 12 1790 because the full court had only six members every decision that it made by a majority was also made by twothirds voting four to two 7 however congress has always allowed less than the courts full membership to make decisions starting with a quorum of four justices in 1789 8earliest beginnings to marshall  editmain articles jay court rutledge court ellsworth court and marshall court under chief justices jay rutledge and ellsworth 1789–1801 the court heard few cases its first decision was west v barnes 1791 a case involving a procedural issue 9 the court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige 10 a situation not helped by the highestprofile case of the era chisholm v georgia 1793 which was reversed within two years by the adoption of the eleventh amendment 11chief justice marshall the courts power and prestige grew substantially during the marshall court 1801–35 12 under marshall the court established the power of judicial review over acts of congress 13 including specifying itself as the supreme expositor of the constitution  marbury v madison 14 15 and made several important constitutional rulings giving shape and substance to the balance of power between the federal government and the states prominently martin v hunters lessee mc culloch v maryland and gibbons v ogden  16 17 18 19the marshall court also ended the practice of each justice issuing his opinion seriatim 20 a remnant of british tradition 21 and instead issuing a single majority opinion 20 also during marshalls tenure although beyond the courts control the impeachment and acquittal of justice samuel chase in 1804–05 helped cement the principle of judicial independence 22 23from taney to taft  editmain articles taney court chase court waite court fuller court white court and taft court the taney court 1836–64 made several important rulings such as sheldon v sill which held that while congress may not limit the subjects the supreme court may hear it may limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects 24 nevertheless it is primarily remembered for its ruling in dred scott v sandford 25 which helped precipitate the civil war 26 in the reconstruction era the chase waite and fuller courts 1864–1910 interpreted the new civil war amendments to the constitution 19 and developed the doctrine of substantive due process  lochner v new york 27 adair v united states  28under the white and taft courts

defamation suits by public figures  new york times v sullivan and supplied the government with an unbroken run of antitrust victories 44the burger court 1969–86 marked a conservative shift 45 it also expanded griswold s right to privacy to strike down abortion laws  roe v wade  46 but divided deeply on affirmative action  regents of the university of california v bakke 47 and campaign finance

number of justices the judiciary act of 1789 called for the appointment of six judges although an 1801 act would have reduced the size of the court to five members upon its next vacancy an 1802 act promptly negated the 1801 act legally restoring the courts size to six members before any such vacancy occurred as the nations boundaries grew congress added justices to correspond with the growing number of judicial circuits seven in 1807 nine in 1837 and ten in 1863 69in 1866 at the behest of chief justice chase congress passed an act providing that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced which would thin the bench to seven justices by attrition consequently one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867 in 1869 however the circuit judges act returned the number of justices to nine 70 where it has since remained president franklin d roosevelt attempted to expand the court in 1937 his proposal envisioned appointment of one additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70 years 6 months and refused retirement up to a maximum bench of 15 justices the proposal was ostensibly to ease the burden of the docket on elderly judges but the actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to pack the court with justices who would support roosevelts new deal 71 the plan usually called the  courtpacking plan  failed in congress 72 nevertheless the courts balance began to shift within months when justice van devanter retired and was replaced by senator hugo black by the end of 1941 roosevelt had appointed seven justices and elevated harlan fiske stone to chief justice 73appointment and confirmation  editmain article appointment and confirmation to the supreme court of the united states the roberts court april 2017 – present front row left to right ruth bader ginsburg anthony kennedy john roberts chief justice clarence thomas and stephen breyer back row left to right elena kagan samuel a alito sonia sotomayor and neil gorsuch the u s constitution states that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint judges of the supreme court 74 most presidents nominate candidates who broadly share their ideological views although a justices decisions may end up being contrary to a presidents expectations because the constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice a president may nominate anyone to serve subject to senate confirmation in modern times the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the groups views the senate judiciary committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination should go to the full senate with a positive negative or neutral report the committees practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent the first nominee to appear before the committee was harlan fiske stone in 1925 who sought to quell concerns about his links to wall street and the modern practice of questioning began with john marshall harlan ii in 1955 75 once the committee reports out the nomination the full senate considers it rejections are relatively uncommon the senate has explicitly rejected twelve supreme court nominees most recently robert bork nominated by president ronald reagan in 1987 although senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative vote in committee to block a nomination prior to 2017 a nomination could be blocked by filibuster once debate had begun in the full senate president lyndon johnson s nomination of sitting associate justice abe fortas to succeed earl warren as chief justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a supreme court nominee it included both republican and democratic senators concerned with fortass ethics president donald trump s nomination of neil gorsuch to the seat vacated by antonin scalia was the second unlike the fortas filibuster however only democratic senators voted against cloture on the gorsuch nomination citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy and the republican majoritys prior refusal to take up president barack obama s nomination of merrick garland to fill the vacancy 76 77 this led the republican majority to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster for supreme court nominations 78not every supreme court nominee has received a floor vote in the senate a president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs typically because it is clear that the senate will reject the nominee this occurred most recently with the nomination of harriet miers in 2006 the senate may also fail to act on a nomination which expires at the end of the session for example president dwight eisenhower s first nomination of john marshall harlan ii in november 1954 was not acted on by the senate eisenhower renominated harlan in january 1955 and harlan was confirmed two months later most recently as previously noted the senate failed to act on the march 2016 nomination of merrick garland the nomination expired in january 2017 and the vacancy was later filled by president trump s appointment of neil gorsuch 79once the senate confirms a nomination the president must prepare and sign a commission to which the seal of the department of justice must be affixed before the new justice can take office 80 the seniority of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date not the confirmation or swearingin date 81before 1981 the approval process of justices was usually rapid from the truman through nixon administrations justices were typically approved within one month from the reagan administration to the present however the process has taken much longer some believe this is because congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past 82 according to the congressional research service the average number of days from nomination to final senate vote since 1975 is 67 days 22 months while the median is 71 days or 23 months 83 84recess appointments  editwhen the senate is in recess a president may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies recess appointees hold office only until the end of the next senate session less than two years the senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue serving of the two chief justices and eleven associate justices who have received recess appointments only chief justice john rutledge was not subsequently confirmed 85no president since dwight d eisenhower has made a recess appointment to the court and the practice has become rare and controversial even in lower federal courts 86 in 1960 after eisenhower had made three such appointments the senate passed a sense of the senate resolution that recess appointments to the court should only be made in unusual circumstances 87 such resolutions are not legally binding but are an expression of congresss views in the hope of guiding executive action 87 88the supreme courts 2014 decision in national labor relations board v noel canning limited the ability of the president to make recess appointments including appointments to the supreme court ruling that the senate decides when the senate is in session or in recess writing for the court justice breyer stated we hold that for purposes of the recess appointments clause the senate is in session when it says it is provided that under its own rules it retains the capacity to transact senate business 89 this ruling allows the senate to prevent recess appointments through the use of proforma sessions 90tenure  editthe constitution provides that justices shall hold their offices during good behavior unless appointed during a senate recess the term good behavior is understood to mean justices may serve for the remainder of their lives unless they are impeached and convicted by congress resign or retire 91 only one justice has been impeached by the house of representatives  samuel chase march 1804 but he was acquitted in the senate march 1805 92 moves to impeach sitting justices have occurred more recently for example william o douglas was the subject of hearings twice in 1953 and again in 1970 and abe fortas resigned while hearings were being organized in 1969 but they did not reach a vote in the house no mechanism exists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury but unable or unwilling to resign 93because justices have indefinite tenure timing of vacancies can be unpredictable sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession as in the early 1970s when lewis franklin powell jr and william rehnquist were nominated to replace hugo black and john marshall harlan ii who retired within a week of each other sometimes a great length of time passes between nominations such as the eleven years between stephen breyer s nomination in 1994 to succeed harry blackmun and the nomination of john roberts in 2005 to fill the seat of sandra day oconnor though roberts nomination was withdrawn and resubmitted for the role of chief justice after rehnquist died despite the variability all but four presidents have been able to appoint at least one justice william henry harrison died a month after taking office though his successor  john tyler made an appointment during that presidential term likewise zachary taylor died 16 months after taking office but his successor  millard fillmore also made a supreme court nomination before the end of that term andrew johnson who became president after the assassination of abraham lincoln was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction in the size of the court jimmy carter is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice somewhat similarly presidents james monroe franklin d roosevelt and george w bush each served a full term without an opportunity to appoint a justice but made appointments during their subsequent terms in office no president who has served more than one full term has gone without at least one opportunity to make an appointment three presidents have appointed justices who together served more than a century andrew jackson abraham lincoln and franklin d roosevelt

supreme court of the united states the court currently has six male and three female justices among the nine justices there is one africanamerican justice thomas and one hispanic justice sotomayor two of the justices were born to at least one immigrant parent justice alitos parents were born in italy 95 96 and justice ginsburgs father was born in russia 97 at least five justices are roman catholics and three are jewish it is unclear whether neil gorsuch considers himself a catholic or an episcopalian 98 the average age is 67 years and 4 months every current justice has an ivy league background 99 four justices are from the state of new york two from california one from new jersey one from georgia and one from colorado 100 in the 19th century every justice was a man of european descent usually northern european and almost always protestant concerns about diversity focused on geography to represent all regions of the country rather than religious ethnic or gender diversity 101most justices have been protestants including 36 episcopalians 19 presbyterians 10 unitarians 5 methodists and 3 baptists 102 103 the first catholic justice was roger taney in 1836 104 and 1916 saw the appointment of the first jewish justice louis brandeis 105 several catholic and jewish justices have since been appointed and in recent years the situation has reversed the court currently has at least five catholic justices and three jewish justices 98racial ethnic and gender diversity began to increase in the late 20th century thurgood marshall became the first african american justice in 1967 105 sandra day oconnor became the first female justice in 1981 105 marshall was succeeded by africanamerican clarence thomas in 1991 106 oconnor was joined by ruth bader ginsburg in 1993 107

justices  editthere are currently three living retired justices of the supreme court of the united states john paul stevens sandra day oconnor and david souter as retired justices they no longer participate in the work of the supreme court but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts usually the united states courts of appeals such assignments are formally made by the chief justice on request of the chief judge of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice in recent years justice oconnor has sat with several courts of appeals around the country and justice souter has frequently sat on the first circuit the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the supreme court the status of a retired justice is analogous to that of a circuit or district court judge who has taken senior status and eligibility of a supreme court justice to assume retired status rather than simply resign from the bench is governed by the same age and service criteria in recent times justices tend to strategically plan their decisions to leave the bench with personal institutional ideological partisan and sometimes even political factors playing a role 108 109 the fear of mental decline and death often motivates justices to step down the desire to maximize the courts strength and legitimacy through one retirement at a time when the court is in recess and during nonpresidential election years suggests a concern for institutional health finally especially in recent decades many justices have timed their departure to coincide with a philosophically compatible president holding office to ensure that a likeminded successor would be appointed 110 111name date of birth appointed by retired under confirmation vote age at appointment

organized by seniority of justices the chief justice is considered the most senior member of the court regardless of the length of his or her service the associate justices are then ranked by the length of their service the interior of the united states supreme court during court sessions the justices sit according to seniority with the chief justice in the center and the associate justices on alternating sides with the most senior associate justice on the chief justices immediate right and the most junior associate justice seated on the left farthest away from the chief justice therefore

court sessions the most recent photograph includes ginsburg kennedy roberts thomas breyer and the four most junior justices standing behind them again in the same order as they would sit during court sessions kagan alito sotomayor gorsuch in the justices private conferences current practice is for them to speak and vote in order of seniority to begin with the chief justice first and end with the most junior associate justice the most junior associate justice in these conferences is charged with any menial tasks the justices may require as they convene alone such as answering the door of their conference room serving beverages and transmitting orders of the court to the clerk 112 justice joseph story served the longest as junior justice from february 3 1812 to september 1 1823 for a total

114 article iii section 1 of the u s constitution prohibits congress from reducing the pay for incumbent justices once a justice meets age and service requirements the justice may retire judicial pensions are based on the same formula used for federal employees but a justices pension as with other federal courts judges can never be less than their salary at the time of retirement judicial leanings  editsee also ideological leanings of u s supreme court justices although justices are nominated by the president in power justices do not represent or receive official endorsements from political parties as is accepted practice in the legislative and executive branches jurists are however informally categorized in legal and political circles as being judicial conservatives moderates or liberals such leanings however generally refer to legal outlook rather than a political or legislative one the nominations of justices are endorsed by individual politicians in the legislative branch who vote their approval or disapproval of the nominated justice following the confirmation of neil gorsuch in 2017 the court consists of five justices appointed by republican presidents and four appointed by democratic presidents it is popularly accepted that chief justice roberts and associate justices thomas alito and gorsuch appointed by republican presidents comprise the courts conservative wing justices ginsburg breyer sotomayor and kagan appointed by democratic presidents comprise the courts liberal wing justice kennedy appointed by republican president reagan is generally considered a conservative who has occasionally voted with liberals 115 and up until justice scalias death he was often the swing vote that determined the outcome of cases divided between the conservative and liberal wings 116 117 118 gorsuch had a track record as a reliably conservative judge in the 10th circuit 119tom goldstein argued in an article in scotusblog in 2010 that the popular view of the supreme court as sharply divided along ideological lines and each side pushing an agenda at every turn is in significant part a caricature designed to fit certain preconceptions 120 he pointed out that in the 2009 term almost half the cases were decided unanimously and only about 20 were decided by a 5to4 vote barely one in ten cases involved the narrow liberalconservative divide fewer if the cases where sotomayor recused herself are not included he also pointed to several cases that defied the popular conception of the ideological lines of the court 121 goldstein further argued that the large number of procriminaldefendant summary dismissals usually cases where the justices decide that the lower courts significantly misapplied precedent and reverse the case without briefing or argument were an illustration that the conservative justices had not been aggressively ideological likewise goldstein stated that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely to invalidate acts of congress show inadequate deference to the political process and be disrespectful of precedent also lacked merit thomas has most often called for overruling prior precedent even if long standing that he views as having been wrongly decided and during the 2009 term scalia and thomas voted most often to invalidate legislation according to statistics compiled by scotusblog in the twelve terms from 2000 to 2011 an average of 19 of the opinions on major issues 22 were decided by a 5–4 vote with an average of 70 of those split opinions decided by a court divided along the traditionally perceived ideological lines about 15 of all opinions issued over that period the conservative bloc has been in the majority about 62 of the time that the court has divided along ideological lines which represents about 44 of all the 5–4 decisions 122in the october 2010 term the court decided 86 cases including 75 signed opinions and 5 summary reversals where the court reverses a lower court without arguments and without issuing an opinion on the case 123 124 four were decided with unsigned opinions two cases affirmed by an equally divided court and two cases were dismissed as improvidently granted justice kagan recused herself from 26 of the cases due to her prior role as united states solicitor general of the 80 cases 38 about 48 the highest percentage since the october 2005 term were decided unanimously 9–0 or 8–0 and 16 decisions were made by a 5–4 vote about 20 compared to 18 in the october 2009 term and 29 in the october 2008 term 125 however in fourteen of the sixteen 5–4 decisions the court divided along the traditional ideological lines with ginsburg breyer sotomayor and kagan on the liberal side and roberts scalia thomas and alito on the conservative and kennedy providing the swing vote this represents 87 of those 16 cases the highest rate in the past 10 years the conservative bloc joined by kennedy formed the majority in 63 of the 5–4 decisions the highest cohesion rate of that bloc in the roberts court 123 126 127 128 129in the october 2011 term the court decided 75 cases of these 33 44 were decided unanimously and 15 20 the same percentage as in the previous term were decided by a vote of 5–4 of the latter 15 the court divided along the perceived ideological lines 10 times with justice kennedy joining the conservative justices roberts scalia thomas and alito five times and with the liberal justices ginsburg breyer sotomayor and kagan five times 122 130 131in the october 2012 term the court decided 78 cases five of them were decided in unsigned opinions 38 out of the 78 decisions representing 49 of the decisions were unanimous in judgement with 24 decisions being completely unanimous a single opinion with every justice that participated joining it this was the largest percentage of unanimous decisions that the court had in ten years since the october 2002 term when 51 of the decisions handed down were unanimous the court split 5–4 in 23 cases 29 of the total of these 16 broke down along the traditionally perceived ideological lines with chief justice roberts and justices scalia thomas and alito on one side justices ginsburg breyer sotomayor and kagan on the other and justice kennedy holding the balance of these 16 cases justice kennedy sided with the conservatives on 10 cases and with the liberals on 6 three cases were decided by an interesting alignment of justices with chief justice roberts joined by justices kennedy thomas breyer and alito in the majority with justices scalia ginsburg sotomayor and kagan in the minority the greatest agreement between justices was between ginsburg and kagan who agreed on 72 of the 75 96 cases in which both voted the lowest agreement between justices was between ginsburg and alito who agreed only on 45 out of 77 54 cases in which they both participated justice kennedy was in the majority of 5–4 decisions on 20 out of 24 83 cases and in 71 of 78 91 cases during the term in line with his position as the swing vote of the court 132 133facilities  editthe present u s supreme court building as viewed from the front from the 1860s until the 1930s the court sat in the old senate chamber of the u s capitol main article united states supreme court building the supreme court first met on february 1 1790 at the merchants exchange building in new york city when philadelphia became the capital the court met briefly in independence hall before settling in old city hall from 1791 until 1800 after the government moved to washington d c the court occupied various spaces in the united states capitol building until 1935 when it moved into its own purposebuilt home the fourstory building was designed by cass gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the capitol and library of congress and is clad in marble the building includes the courtroom justices chambers an extensive law library various meeting spaces and auxiliary services including a gymnasium the supreme court building is within the ambit of the architect of the capitol but maintains its own police force separate from the capitol police 134located across first street from the united states capitol at one first street ne and maryland avenue 135 136 the building is open to the public from 9 am to 430 pm weekdays but closed on weekends and holidays 135 visitors may not tour the actual courtroom unaccompanied there is a cafeteria a gift shop exhibits and a halfhour informational film 134 when the court is not in session lectures about the courtroom are held hourly from 930 am to 330 pm and reservations are not necessary 134 when the court is in session the public may attend oral arguments which are held twice each morning and sometimes afternoons on mondays tuesdays and wednesdays in twoweek intervals from october through late april with breaks during december and february visitors are seated on a firstcome firstserved

midmay until the end of june the court releases orders and opinions beginning at 10 am and these 15 to 30minute sessions are open to the public on a similar basis 134 supreme court police are available to answer questions 135jurisdiction  editinscription on the wall of the supreme court building from marbury v madison in which chief justice john marshall outlined the concept of judicial review main article procedures of the supreme court of the united states congress is authorized by article iii of the federal constitution to regulate the supreme courts appellate jurisdiction the supreme court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases between two or more states 138 but may decline to hear such cases 139 it also possesses original but not exclusive jurisdiction to hear all actions or proceedings to which ambassadors other public ministers consuls or vice consuls of foreign states are parties all controversies between the united states and a state and all actions or proceedings by a state against the citizens of another state or against aliens 140in 1906 the court asserted its original jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for contempt of court in united states v shipp 141 the resulting proceeding remains the only contempt proceeding and only criminal trial in the courts history 142 143 the contempt proceeding arose from the lynching of ed johnson in chattanooga tennessee the evening after justice john marshall harlan granted johnson a stay of execution to allow his lawyers to file an appeal johnson was removed from his jail cell by a lynch mob—aided by the local sheriff who left the prison virtually unguarded—and hung from a bridge after which a deputy sheriff pinned a note on johnsons body reading to justice harlan come get your nigger now 142 the local sheriff john shipp cited the supreme courts intervention as the rationale for the lynching the court appointed its deputy clerk as special master to preside over the trial in chattanooga with closing arguments made in washington before the supreme court justices who found nine individuals guilty of contempt sentencing three to 90 days in jail and the rest to 60 days in jail 142 143 144in all other cases however the court has only appellate jurisdiction including the ability to issue writs of mandamus and writs of prohibition to lower courts it considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely almost all cases are brought to the supreme court on appeal in practice the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the court are disputes between two or more states  citation neededthe courts appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from federal courts of appeal through certiorari certiorari before judgment and certified questions  145 the united states court of appeals for the armed forces through certiorari 146 the supreme court of puerto rico through certiorari 147 the supreme court of the virgin islands through certiorari 148 the district of columbia court of appeals through certiorari 149 and final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had through certiorari 149 in the last case an appeal may be made to the supreme court from a lower state court if the states highest court declined to hear an appeal or lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal for example a decision rendered by one of the florida district courts of appeal can be appealed to the u s supreme court if a the supreme court of florida declined to grant certiorari eg florida star v b j f or b the district court of appeal issued a per curiam decision simply affirming the lower courts decision without discussing the merits of the case since the supreme court of florida lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals of such decisions 150 the power of the supreme court to consider appeals from state courts rather than just federal courts was created by the judiciary act of 1789 and upheld early in the courts history by its rulings in martin v hunters lessee 1816 and cohens v virginia 1821 the supreme court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions although there are several devices that permit socalled collateral review of state cases it has to be noted that this collateral review often only applies to individuals on death row and not through the regular judicial system 151since article three of the united states constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain cases or controversies the supreme court cannot decide cases that are moot and it does not render advisory opinions as the supreme courts of some states may do for example in de funis v odegaard 416 u s 312 1974 the court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit and a decision from the court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered however the court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot if an issue is capable of repetition yet evading review the court will address it even though the party before the court would not himself be made whole by a favorable result in roe v wade 410 u s 113 1973 and other abortion cases the court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the supreme court another mootness exception is voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct in which the court considers the probability of recurrence and plaintiffs need for relief 152justices as circuit justices  editthe united states is divided into thirteen circuit courts of appeals each of which is assigned a circuit justice from the supreme court although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the history of the republic its meaning has changed through time under the judiciary act of 1789 each justice was required to ride circuit or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges this practice encountered opposition from many justices who cited the difficulty of travel moreover there was a potential for a conflict of interest on the court if a justice had previously decided the same case while riding circuit circuit riding was abolished in 1891 today the circuit justice for each circuit is responsible for dealing with certain types of applications that under the courts rules may be addressed by a single justice these include applications for emergency stays including stays of execution in deathpenalty cases and injunctions pursuant to the all writs act arising from cases within that circuit as well as routine requests such as requests for extensions of time in the past circuit justices also sometimes ruled on motions for bail in criminal cases writs of habeas corpus and applications for writs of error granting permission to appeal ordinarily a justice will resolve such an application by simply endorsing it granted or denied or entering a standard form of order however the justice may elect to write an opinion—referred to as an inchambers opinion —in such matters if he or she wishes a circuit justice may sit as a judge on the court of appeals of that circuit but over the past hundred years this has rarely occurred a circuit justice sitting with the court of appeals has seniority over the chief judge of the circuit the chief justice has traditionally been assigned to the district of columbia circuit the fourth circuit which includes maryland and virginia the states surrounding the district of columbia and since it was established the federal circuit each associate justice is assigned to one or two judicial circuits as of june 27 2017 the allotment of the justices among the circuits is 153circuit justice district of columbia circuit chief justice roberts first circuit justice breyer second circuit justice ginsburg third circuit justice alito fourth circuit chief justice roberts fifth circuit justice alito sixth circuit justice kagan seventh circuit justice kagan eighth circuit justice gorsuch ninth circuit justice kennedy tenth circuit justice sotomayor eleventh circuit justice thomas federal circuit chief justice roberts four of the current justices are assigned to circuits on which they previously sat as circuit judges chief justice roberts d c circuit justice breyer first circuit justice alito third circuit and justice kennedy ninth circuit process  editmain article procedures of the supreme court of the united states a term of the supreme court commences on the first monday of each october and continues until june or early july of the following year each term consists of alternating periods of around two weeks known as sittings and recesses justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings they discuss cases and write opinions during recesses case selection  editnearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of certiorari commonly referred to as cert the court may review any case in the federal courts of appeals by writ of certiorari granted upon the petition of any party to any civil or criminal case 154 court may only review final judgments rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had if those judgments involve a question of federal statutory or constitutional law 155 the party that appealed to the court is the petitioner and the nonmover is the respondent all case names before the court are styled petitioner v respondent regardless of which party initiated the lawsuit in the trial court for example criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the state and against an individual as in state of arizona v ernesto miranda if the defendant is convicted and his conviction then is affirmed on appeal in the state supreme court when he petitions for cert the name of the case becomes miranda v arizona there are situations where the court has original jurisdiction such as when two states have a dispute against each other or when there is a dispute between the united states and a state in such instances a case is filed with the supreme court directly examples of such cases include united states v texas a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the united states or to texas and virginia v tennessee a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires congressional approval although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of georgia v brailsford 156 parties in an action at law in which the supreme court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine issues of fact 157 two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial era borders and rights under navigable waters in new jersey v delaware and water rights between riparian states upstream of navigable waters in kansas v colorado a cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called a conference a conference is a private meeting of the nine justices by themselves the public and the justices clerks are excluded the rule of four permits four of the nine justices to grant a writ of certiorari if it is granted the case proceeds to the briefing stage otherwise the case ends except in death penalty cases and other cases in which the court orders briefing from the respondent the respondent may but is not required to file a response to the cert petition the court grants a petition for cert only for compelling reasons spelled out in the courts rule 10 such reasons include resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or a provision of the federal constitution correcting an egregious departure from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings resolving an important question of federal law or to expressly review a decision of a lower court that conflicts directly with a previous decision of the court when a conflict of interpretations arises from differing interpretations of the same law or constitutional provision issued by different federal circuit courts of appeals lawyers call this situation a circuit split if the court votes to deny a cert petition as it does in the vast majority of such petitions that come before it it does so typically without comment a denial of a cert petition is not a judgment on the merits of a case and the decision of the lower court stands as the final ruling in the case to manage the high volume of cert petitions received by the court each year of the more than 7000 petitions the court receives each year it will usually request briefing and hear oral argument in 100 or fewer the court employs an internal case management tool known as the  cert pool  currently all justices except for justices alito and gorsuch participate in the cert pool 158 159 160 161oral argument  editwhen the court grants a cert petition the case is set for oral argument both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case as distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition with the consent of the parties or approval of the court amici curiae or friends of the court may also file briefs the court holds twoweek oral argument sessions each month from october through april each side has thirty minutes to present its argument the court may choose to give more time though this is rare 162 and during that time the justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions the petitioner gives the first presentation and may reserve some time to rebut the respondents arguments after the respondent has concluded amici curiae may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees the court advises counsel to assume that the justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case supreme court bar  editin order to plead before the court an attorney must first be admitted to the courts bar approximately 4000 lawyers join the bar each year the bar contains an estimated 230000 members in reality pleading is limited to several hundred attorneys the rest join for a onetime fee of 200 earning the court about 750000 annually attorneys can be admitted as either individuals or as groups the group admission is held before the current justices of the supreme court wherein the chief justice approves a motion to admit the new attorneys 163 lawyers commonly apply for the cosmetic value of a certificate to display in their office or on their resume they also receive access to better seating if they wish to attend an oral argument 164 members of the supreme court bar are also granted access to the collections of the supreme court library 165decision  editat the conclusion of oral argument the case is submitted for decision cases are decided by majority vote of the justices it is the courts practice to issue decisions in all cases argued in a particular term by the end of that term within that term however the court is under no obligation to release a decision within any set time after oral argument at the conclusion of oral argument the justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied and the most senior justice in the majority assigns the initial draft of the courts opinion to a justice on his or her side drafts of the courts opinion as well as any concurring or dissenting opinions 166 circulate among the justices until the court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case since recording devices are banned inside the courtroom of the united states supreme court building the delivery of the decision to the media is done via paper copies and is known as the running of the interns 167 168it is possible that through recusals or vacancies the court divides evenly on a case if that occurs then the decision of the court below is affirmed but does not establish binding precedent in effect it results in a return to the status quo ante for a case to be heard there must be a quorum of at least six justices 169 if a quorum is not available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices believes that the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the court had been evenly divided for cases brought to the supreme court by direct appeal from a united states district court the chief justice may order the case remanded to the appropriate u s court of appeals for a final decision there 170 this has only occurred once in u s history in the case of united states v alcoa 1945 171published opinions  editthe courts opinions are published in three stages first a slip opinion is made available on the courts web site and through other outlets next several

challenged and removed january 2017  learn how and when to remove this template messagethe federal court system and the judicial authority to interpret the constitution received little attention in the debates over the drafting and ratification of the constitution the power of judicial review in fact is nowhere mentioned in it over the ensuing years the question of whether the power of judicial review was even intended by the drafters of the constitution was quickly frustrated by the lack of evidence bearing on the question either way 176 nevertheless the power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive actions it determines are unlawful or unconstitutional is a wellestablished precedent many of the founding fathers accepted the notion of judicial review in federalist no 78 alexander hamilton wrote a constitution is in fact and must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental law it therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body if there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two that which has the superior obligation and validity ought of course to be preferred or in other words the constitution ought to be preferred to the statute the supreme court firmly established its power to declare laws unconstitutional in marbury v madison 1803 consummating the american system of checks and balances in explaining the power of judicial review chief justice john marshall stated that the authority to interpret the law was the particular province of the courts part of the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is his contention was not that the court had privileged insight into constitutional requirements but that it was the constitutional duty of the judiciary as well as the other branches of government to read and obey the dictates of the constitution 176since the founding of the republic there has been a tension between the practice of judicial review and the democratic ideals of egalitarianism selfgovernment selfdetermination and freedom of conscience at one pole are those who view the federal judiciary and especially the supreme court as being the most separated and least checked of all branches of government 177 indeed federal judges and justices on the supreme court are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure during good behavior and their pay may not be diminished while they hold their position  section 1 of article three  though subject to the process of impeachment only one justice has ever been impeached and no supreme court justice has been removed from office at the other pole are those who view the judiciary as the least dangerous branch with little ability to resist the exhortations of the other branches of government 176 the supreme court it is noted cannot directly enforce its rulings instead it relies on respect for the constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments one notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832 when the state of georgia ignored the supreme courts decision in worcester v georgia president andrew jackson who sided with the georgia courts is supposed to have remarked  john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it  178 however this alleged quotation has been disputed some state governments in the south also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment brown v board of education more recently many feared that president nixon would refuse to comply with the courts order in united states v nixon 1974 to surrender the watergate tapes nixon however ultimately complied with the supreme courts ruling supreme court decisions can be and have been purposefully overturned by constitutional amendment which has happened on five occasions chisholm v georgia 1793 – overturned by the eleventh amendment 1795dred scott v sandford 1857 – overturned by the thirteenth amendment 1865 and the fourteenth amendment 1868pollock v farmers loan  trust co 1895 – overturned by the sixteenth amendment 1913minor v happersett 1875 – overturned by the nineteenth amendment 1920oregon v mitchell 1970 – overturned by the twentysixth amendment 1971when the court rules on matters involving the interpretation of laws rather than of the constitution simple legislative action can reverse the decisions for example in 2009 congress passed the lilly ledbetter act superseding the limitations given in ledbetter v goodyear tire  rubber co in 2007 also the supreme court is not immune from political and institutional consideration lower federal courts and state courts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations as do law enforcement officials 179in addition the other two branches can restrain the court through other mechanisms congress can increase the number of justices giving the president power to influence future decisions by appointments as in roosevelts court packing plan discussed above congress can pass legislation that restricts the jurisdiction of the supreme court and other federal courts over certain topics and cases this is suggested by language in section 2 of article three where the appellate jurisdiction is granted with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make the court sanctioned such congressional action in the reconstruction case ex parte mc cardle 1869 though it rejected congress power to dictate how particular cases must be decided in united states v klein 1871 on the other hand through its power of judicial review the supreme court has defined the scope and nature of the powers and separation between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government for example in united states v curtisswright export corp 1936 dames  moore v regan 1981 and notably in goldwater v carter 1979 where it effectively gave the presidency the power to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of congress or the senate the courts decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of executive authority as in humphreys executor v united states 1935 the steel seizure case 1952 and united states v nixon 1974 law clerks  editsee also law clerk and list of law clerks of the supreme court of the united states each supreme court justice hires several law clerks to review petitions for writ of certiorari research them prepare bench memorandums and draft opinions associate justices are allowed four clerks the chief justice is allowed five clerks but chief justice rehnquist hired only three per year and chief justice roberts usually hires only four 180 generally law clerks serve a term of one to two years the first law clerk was hired by associate justice horace gray in 1882 180 181 oliver wendell holmes jr and louis brandeis were the first supreme court justices to use recent law school graduates as clerks rather than hiring a stenographersecretary 182 most law clerks are recent law school graduates the first female clerk was lucile lomen hired in 1944 by justice william o douglas 180 the first africanamerican william t coleman jr was hired in 1948 by justice felix frankfurter 180 a disproportionately large number of law clerks have obtained law degrees from elite law schools especially harvard yale the university of chicago columbia and stanford from 1882 to 1940 62 of law clerks were graduates of harvard law school 180 those chosen to be supreme court law clerks usually have graduated in the top of their law school class and were often an editor of the law review or a member of the moot court board by the mid1970s clerking previously for a judge in a federal court of appeals had also become a prerequisite to clerking for a supreme court justice 183seven supreme court justices previously clerked for other justices byron white for frederick m vinson john paul stevens for wiley rutledge william rehnquist for robert h jackson stephen breyer for arthur goldberg john roberts for william rehnquist elena kagan for thurgood marshall and neil gorsuch for both byron white and anthony kennedy gorsuch is the first justice to serve alongside a justice for whom he or she clerked several current supreme court justices have also clerked in the federal courts of appeals john roberts for judge henry friendly of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit justice samuel alito for judge leonard i garth of the united states court of appeals for the third circuit elena kagan for judge abner j mikva of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and neil gorsuch for judge david b sentelle of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia politicization of the court  editclerks hired by each of the justices of the supreme court are often given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft supreme court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of vanderbilt university law school 184 185 as law has moved closer to mere politics political affiliations have naturally and predictably become proxies for the different political agendas that have been pressed in and through the courts former federal court of appeals judge j michael luttig said 184 david j garrow professor of history at the university of cambridge stated that the court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government we are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the house of representatives professor garrow said each side is putting forward only ideological purists 184according to the vanderbilt law review study this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the supreme court is a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law 184 a poll conducted in june 2012 by the new york times and cbs news showed just 44 of americans approve of the job the supreme court is doing threequarters said justices decisions are sometimes influenced by their political or personal views 186criticism  editthe court has been the object of criticisms on a range of issues among them judicial activism  editthe supreme court has been criticized for not keeping within constitutional bounds by engaging in judicial activism rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology 187 an often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in lochner v new york which has been criticized by many prominent thinkers including robert bork justice antonin scalia and chief justice john roberts 187 188 and which was reversed in the 1930s 189 190 191 an often cited example of liberal judicial activism is roe v wade 1973 which legalized abortion in part on the basis of the right to privacy inferred from the fourteenth amendment a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous 187 legal scholars 192 193 justices 194 and presidential candidates 195 have criticized the roe decision the progressive brown v board of education decision has been criticized by conservatives such as patrick buchanan 196 and former presidential contender barry goldwater 197 more recently citizens united v federal election commission was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in first national bank of boston v bellotti 1978 that the first amendment applies to corporations 198 lincoln warned referring to the dred scott decision that if government policy became irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme courtthe people will have ceased to be their own rulers 199 former justice thurgood marshall justified judicial activism with these words you do what you think is right and let the law catch up 200 during different historical periods the court has leaned in different directions 201 202 critics from both sides complain that activistjudges abandon the constitution and substitute their own views instead 203 204 205 critics include writers such as andrew napolitano 206 phyllis schlafly 207 mark r levin 208 mark i sutherland 209 and james mac gregor burns 210 211 past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism including franklin d roosevelt richard nixon and ronald reagan 212 213 failed supreme court nominee robert bork wrote what judges have wrought is a coup détat – slowmoving and genteel but a coup détat nonetheless 214 senator al franken quipped that when politicians talk about judicial activism their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than they would like 215 one law professor claimed in a 1978 article that the supreme court is in some respects certainly a legislative body 216failing to protect individual rights  editcourt decisions have been criticized for failing to protect individual rights the dred scott 1857 decision upheld slavery 217plessy v ferguson 1896 upheld segregation under the doctrine of separate but equal 218 kelo v city of new london 2005 was criticized by prominent politicians including new jersey governor jon corzine as undermining property rights 219 220 some critics suggest the 2009 bench with a conservative majority has become increasingly hostile to voters by siding with indianas voter identification laws which tend to disenfranchise large numbers of people without drivers licenses especially poor and minority voters according to one report 221 senator al franken criticized the court for eroding individual rights 215 however others argue that the court is too protective of some individual rights particularly those of people accused of crimes or in detention for example chief justice warren burger was an outspoken critic of the exclusionary rule and justice scalia criticized the courts decision in boumediene v bush for being too protective of the rights of guantanamo detainees on the grounds that habeas corpus was limited to sovereign territory 222supreme court has too much power  editthis criticism is related to complaints about judicial activism george will wrote that the court has an increasingly central role in american governance 223 it was criticized for intervening in bankruptcy proceedings regarding ailing carmaker chrysler corporation in 2009 224 a reporter wrote that justice ruth bader ginsburg s intervention in the chrysler bankruptcy left open the possibility of further judicial review but argued overall that the intervention was a proper use of supreme court power to check the executive branch 224 warren e burger before becoming chief justice argued that since the supreme court has such unreviewable power it is likely to selfindulge itself and unlikely to engage in dispassionate analysis 225 larry sabato wrote excessive authority has accrued to the federal courts especially the supreme court 226courts are poor check on executive power  editbritish constitutional scholar adam tomkins sees flaws in the american system of having courts and specifically the supreme court act as checks on the executive and legislative branches he argues that because the courts must wait sometimes for years for cases to navigate their way through the system their ability to restrain other branches is severely weakened 227 228 in contrast the federal constitutional court of germany for example can directly declare a law unconstitutional upon request federal versus state power  editthere has been debate throughout american history about the boundary between federal and state power while framers such as james madison 229 and alexander hamilton 230 argued in the federalist papers that their thenproposed constitution would not infringe on the power of state governments 231 232 233 234 others argue that expansive federal power is good and consistent with the framers wishes 235 the tenth amendment to the united states constitution explicitly grants powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people the supreme court has been criticized for giving the federal government too much power to interfere with state authority one criticism is that it has allowed the federal government to misuse the commerce clause by upholding regulations and legislation which have little to do with interstate commerce but that were enacted under the guise of regulating interstate commerce and by voiding state legislation for allegedly interfering with interstate commerce for example the commerce clause was used by the fifth circuit court of appeals to uphold the endangered species act thus protecting six endemic species of insect near austin texas despite the fact that the insects had no commercial value and did not travel across state lines the supreme court let that ruling stand without comment in 2005 236 chief justice john marshall asserted congresss power over interstate commerce was complete in itself may be exercised to its utmost extent and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the constitution 237 justice alito said congressional authority under the commerce clause is quite broad 238 modern day theorist robert b reich suggests debate over the commerce clause continues today 237 advocates of states rights such as constitutional scholar kevin gutzman have also criticized the court saying it has misused the fourteenth amendment to undermine state authority justice brandeis in arguing for allowing the states to operate without federal interference suggested that states should be laboratories of democracy 239 one critic wrote the great majority of supreme court rulings of unconstitutionality involve state not federal law 240 however others see the fourteenth amendment as a positive force that extends protection of those rights and guarantees to the state level 241secretive proceedings  editthe court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public view 242 according to a review of jeffrey toobin s expose the nine inside the secret world of the supreme court its inner workings are difficult for reporters to cover like a closed cartel only revealing itself through public events and printed releases with nothing about its inner workings 243 the reviewer writes few reporters dig deeply into court affairs it all works very neatly the only ones hurt are the american people who know little about nine individuals with enormous power over their lives 243 larry sabato complains about the courts insularity 226 a fairleigh dickinson university poll conducted in 2010 found that 61 of american voters agreed that televising court hearings would be good for democracy and 50 of voters stated they would watch court proceedings if they were televised 244 245 in recent years many justices have appeared on television written books and made public statements to journalists 246 247 in a 2009 interview on cspan journalists joan biskupic of usa today and lyle denniston of scotusblog argued that the court is a very open institution with only the justices private conferences inaccessible to others 246 in october 2010 the court began the practice of posting on its website recordings and transcripts of oral arguments on the friday after they occur judicial interference in political disputes  editsome court decisions have been criticized for injecting the court into the political arena and deciding questions that are the purview of the other two branches of government the bush v gore decision in which the supreme court intervened in the 2000 presidential election and effectively chose george w bush over al gore has been criticized extensively particularly by liberals 243 248 249 250 251 252 another example are court decisions on apportionment and redistricting in baker v carr the court decided it could rule on apportionment questions justice frankfurter in a scathing dissent argued against the court wading into socalled political questions 253not choosing enough cases to review  editsenator arlen specter said the court should decide more cases 215 on the other hand although justice scalia acknowledged in a 2009 interview that the number of cases that the court hears now is smaller today than when he first joined the supreme court he also stated that he has not changed his standards for deciding whether to review a case nor does he believe his colleagues have changed their standards he attributed the high volume of cases in the late 1980s at least in part to an earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way through the courts 246lifetime tenure  editcritic larry sabato wrote the insularity of lifetime tenure combined with the appointments of relatively young attorneys who give long service on the bench produces senior judges representing the views of past generations better than views of the current day 226 sanford levinson has been critical of justices who stayed in office despite medical deterioration based on longevity 254 james mac gregor burns stated lifelong tenure has produced a critical time lag with the supreme court institutionally almost always behind the times 210 proposals to solve these problems include term limits for justices as proposed by levinson 255 and sabato 226 256 as well as a mandatory retirement age proposed by richard epstein 257 among others 258 however others suggest lifetime tenure brings substantial benefits such as impartiality and freedom from political pressure alexander hamilton in federalist 78 wrote nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office 259accepting gifts  editthe 21st century has seen increased scrutiny of justices accepting expensive gifts and travel all of the members of the roberts court have accepted travel or gifts in 2012 justice sonia sotomayor received 19 million in advances from her publisher knopf doubleday 260 justice scalia and others took dozens of expensive trips to exotic locations paid for by private donors 261 private events sponsored by partisan groups that are attended by both the justices and those who have an interest in their decisions have raised concerns about access and inappropriate communications 262 stephen spaulding the legal director at common cause said there are fair questions raised by some of these trips about their commitment to being impartial 261see also  editsupreme
