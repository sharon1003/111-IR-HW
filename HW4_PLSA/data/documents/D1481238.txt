scientific testable questionsname schmiedreid©2008all rights reservedhttpwwwsciencehouseorgnesdisgulfguidehtml period the answers to good scientific questions over the years have lead to important discoveries scientists are particularly good at developing simple yet elegent questions that can be tested then in a perfect world scientists engineers architects and other people use the knowledge gained from the answers to these questions to make life on earth better sadly this isnt always the case good questions are stated in a way that frame or describes a problem and are able to be tested using accepted scientific methods there are 3 main types of questions each asks or requires a different type and amount of prior knowledge and build until the researcher creates an experimental question1 verification questions these are basic data collecting questions they are useful in building knowledge examples are is it cold today is the sun still out is a flame hottest when it is blue2 significanttheory questions require an explanation and prior knowledge examples are why should you point a cars wheels toward the curb when parking on a hill do clouds have to be in the sky for it to rain why do you add acid to water instead of water to acid these questions increase knowledge of the subject but need prior knowledge to be asked3 experimental questions require explanations prior knowledge and are testable example if salt is added to water would the solution still boil at the same temperature or if suntan lotion is put on ultraviolet detecting beads will the beads still change color experimental questions require a more in depth answer that requires testing experimental questions are what researchers use using a lined sheet of paper please tell what type of scientific question is listed belowa number the paper 18 with a space between the numbersb next write verification significant or experimental after each numberc finally explain why you answered what you did1 will there be a full moon tonight 2 why is it important that the desert plants get rain in spring 3 why is the desert hot 4 what is the significance of red sky at nightfall 5 why does lightening come before thunder 6 how can the time delay between lightening and thunder be used to tell how far away a storm is 7 can stars be red 8 if salt is added to water will the water boil at a different temperaturepart 2  creating scientific questions developing questions is a skill that requires practice just like hitting a baseball over time you will master this skill later on you will be able to recognize all three types of scientific question and then use this knowledge to help solve just about any problem lets take a look at four basic guidelines for writing scientific questions1 a good scientific question is one that can have an answer and be tested why is that a rock is not as good a question as what are rocks made of2 a good scientific question can be tested by some experiment or measurement that you can do in this case where does the sun come from is not as good as how will human skin covered with spf 30 suntan lotion react to solar radiation compared to skin not covered with suntan lotion3 a good scientific question builds on what you already know will fertilizer make grass grow greener is not as good as what types of fertilizer will make grass grow greener and not cause harm to the environment4 a good scientific question when answered leads to other good questions what is hiv does not lead to as many other questions as how does the hiv virus cause the human immune system to malfunction the questions above ask what and how in a way that focuses in on the specific problem to be studied these questions frame a problem in a way that can be tested for example an example of a good scientific question about salmon might bewhat is causing the forest bordering the streams to be unhealthy and no longer support salmon runs qs 914 use the guidelines above to tell which of each pair of questions below is a better scientific question and then clearly explain why you think this is so use the same separate paper as qs 189 a what are the different things that make up airb what is air10 a why is the sun out todayb what atomic elements make up stars11 a what is the reason that collies have bad hip socketsb what causes grass to turn brown during the summer12 a how does the space shuttle keep from burning upb why is the international space station in orbit13 a what is influenzab how does influenza change mutate to make so many new strains each year14 finally create and write your own good experimental scientific question scientific method index project page home© 2008 john schmied  mike reid all rights reserved
