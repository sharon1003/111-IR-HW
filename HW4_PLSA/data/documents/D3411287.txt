eligibility criteria for the pmp exam is to have minimum 3 years  36 months unique nonoverlapping professional project management experience during which at least 4500 hours were spent leading and

2013 project 1 ran from jan’13 to jun’13 6 months and project 2 ran from apr’13 to dec’13 9 months in this case you have an overlap between the two projects during apr’09 to jun’09 3 months so the experience from these 3 months is counted as 3 months and not 3 x 2  6 months therefore your total unique nonoverlapping experience would be counted as 12 3  3  6 months not 15 6  9 months the pmp

examination is preceded by a tutorial and followed by a survey both of which are optional and can take up to 15 minutes each to complete the time used to complete the tutorial and survey is not

actually follow up on what you claim if youve been audited in other words does pmi randomly select people and check with their references to see if the evidence they submitted as part of the auditing process was true follow on question if no then doesnt it raise some serious questions about the credibility of the auditing process rendering the whole auditing process to be nothing more than eyewash a meaningless exercise with no purpose br dr pdg jakarta indonesia httpwwwbuildprojectmanagementcompetencycom reply to dr pdgharwinder singh november 11 2013 at 0154 amhello dr pdg first of all welcome back im genuinely honored that you still follow my blog even though it was dormant for a long time coming to your question im not the one to defend pmi and you know it from our past interactions starting with my personal experience 1 i have got 2 pmi certifications but my applications were not audited 2 i know a very few people who have actually gone through the audit process based on my guess the percentage of applications audited might actually be less than 10 3 i have never come across or heard of a case where pmi actually called up the references now my personal opinion on this matter i think that the audit process is not effective it is really hurting the credibility of the pmp certification and the interests of qualified and skilled project managers who have put in their hard work and hardearned money to achieve this certification so yes i think its a futile exercise  a waste of time and resources i dont think its a deterrent for unqualified applicants which is a huge percentage of total applicants pmi is not doing enough to scrutize the applications for reasons which seem too obvious and it will hurt them in the long term i have been running a poll on this very same topic at the bottom of this page you can see it right now thanks for raising this point br anonymous april 27 2015 at 1126 amthanks you very much for these faqs reply

students were auditted and could not attend the exam in time it does happen there were some corridor rumours at my workplace that if you are with big reputable companies the chances of you getting auditted is slightly less but thats what i heard reply to jo lynn harwinder singh july 28 2015 at 0104 pmthanks for sharing that bit jo lynn its quite possible but well never know for sure sh ub hr aj its co rn er july 28 2015 at 0328 amhello i have a question i have the required hours of experience 4500 however i worked for 2 years and 11 months which is a month less than the required 3 years quota for persons having 4 years bachelors degree previously i worked as a lecturer at an university my question is if i am still eligible to appear for pmp i have a capm certification already thank you reply to sh ub hr aj its co rn er harwinder singh july 28 2015 at 0110 pmhello sh ub hr aj its co rn er technically you are not but if you have other experience like volunteering with documented evidence where you used project management skills you can probably qualify or if you have experience in a technical role where youve partially done project management activities like project planning scheduling costingbudgeting communications management vendor management etc then that experience can count as well otherwise you could just wait and gain more experience and go for pmp hope that helps

february 15 2017 at 0723 amhi ann repeated in what sense can you clarify your question further thanks firdavs april 06 2017 at 0723 pmhi harwinder first of all i want thank you for detailed explanation i have a test on april 14 and my eligibility period ends on april 21 this will be my first attempt and i didnt prepared well for exam due my tight schedule at work so two questions will arise here 1 what if i dont go to my first attempt and reaplly do i have to wait a year for reapplying how soon can i reapply 2 if i fail the first attempt how soon can i retake it do i have a chance to retake before my eligibility is over thanks in advance for your help reply to firdavs harwinder singh april 08 2017 at 0809 amhello firdavs 1 i dont think you have to wait for 1 year that rule applies to people who fail 3 times you should be able to reapply immediately 2 theres no written rule that says you must wait x days but i believe when you try to apply for the 2nd attempt right away pmi system may not be updated with your first attempt results usually it takes a few days for your result to reflect in their system so that might introduce a lag moreover you may not want to go for the second attempt right away without proper preparation i suggest you write to pmi customer care to get these issues clarified hope that helps good luck unknown april 06 2017 at 1024 pmthanks a lot for such a detailed information the faq section is great reply to unknown harwinder singh april 08 2017 at 0800 amthanks for your appreciation
