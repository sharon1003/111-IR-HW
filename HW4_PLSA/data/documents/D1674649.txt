hopkins university photo credit wikipediabeing a university professor is in no way the least stressful job for 2013 in fact 2013 is likely to be one of the worst years to be a university professor but many pixels are being spent across the forbescom platform at the site of forbes staff columnist susan adams adams has been a legal affairs columnist at forbes since 1995 and writes widely on leadership and careers new – fda weaponizes ‘opioid’ term against kratom consumers i don’t know adams but i do know that working fulltime for forbes requires one to meet a very high bar for example many of my readers would know matt herper as one of the top pharmaceutical industry journalists in north america similarly bruce japsen formerly of the chicago tribune is one of the best writers on health care in the us so i was extremely surprised and frankly disappointed that adams would write such a misguided article based apparently on a report from career castcom and her perception of university faculty through one tenured professor she knows yesterday adams issued a mea culpa within the same post — and i give her credit for keeping the original post up as of this writing her post has has 123000 pages views and 351 comments 115 in the last 24 hr primarily objections from faculty members on the front lines at us universities i don’t want to make the same mistake of a small sample size but i feel that my primarily academic biomedical research and teaching career since 1992 gives me some latitude to make a few generalizations i’ve worked at a state university’s top 25 academic medical center and pharmacy school an elite private research university a teachingintensive historicallyblack collegeuniversity in a large state university system and am now a halftime writing professor in a department of english at a state landgrant university i also work halftime as a science communications director for a state natural sciences museum the emphasis on teaching vs research at each institution has varied i’ve earned tenure twice once in the traditional fashion at the 7th year of an assistant professorship and again at appointment as a professor and department chair with the caveats of my own experiences and those of colleagues with whom i’ve worked or otherwise interacted around the world here are my top 10 reasons that being a university professor is stressful1 performance advancement and almost every scholarly metric is dependent on anonymous peerreview write a grant application get three anonymous reviewer critiques submit research results for publication in a peerreviewed journal get anonymous reviewer critiques submit your tenure portfolio or posttenure portfolio to a college promotion and tenure committee get anonymous reviews while one may know the general composition of grant review and promotion and tenure committees you don’t know precisely who is gunning for you anonymity is sometimes useful but more often allows petty vendettas to occur that are independent of the work at hand2 in the biomedical sciences universities rarely pay one’s full salary research universities medical schools in particular are highlydependent on federal research funding to pay faculty salaries so you have to raise anywhere from a quarter to 100 of your salary some research universities typically hire more faculty than they can afford with the assumption that research project grants will generally cover a relatively stable percentage of faculty salaries the national institutes of health has recently announced that it’s expected universities to step up over the next 20 years3 faculty must provide salary and university benefits for research staff if you’re in a tenured or tenuretrack position your salary will likely be covered for at least nine months but everyone works 12 months regardless because you’re competing for research funds against others who will work 12 months even if they only have a ninemonth salary however if you have research staff fellows editorial assistants etc you have to pay for these folks off your research grants that’s usually 100 of not only their salary but benefits as well research grant funds technically come to the university so salary and benefits are in effect paid by the university but if you lose your grant you lose your laboratory personnel – no backstop no sixmonth severance it’s here today gone tomorrow and all the investment expertise and institutional lab memory goes away if you lose your personnel it becomes more difficult for you to score subsequent funding that then puts you in a position even if you have tenure of having lab space taken away and having more teaching and administrative committee work piled on you making it even more difficult to score subsequent funding4 faculty must provide universities with the teat of indirect grant costs the pressure for faculty to obtain research funding is not just selfmotivated the common complaint among faculty is that if one is lucky to score a grant in this funding environment the first thing a supervisor will ask is when they’re submitting the next one why because universities garner an additional 4080 on top of what your laboratory requests for a project yes if i get a grant for 200000 per year the university gets 80000160000 that i don’t see these funds are obviously necessary to cover indirect costs such as utilities facilities and maintenance and safety and security functions but these funds are often squirreled away for other special projects of highranking administrators at some universities the funds are managed well — to provide recruitment packages for new tenuretrack faculty at other universities the distribution of indirect cost recovery is questionable more central functions that should be covered by indirect costs are now being billed directly to laboratories even though their grants provide the university with substantial indirect costs you can never have enough grants at most biomedical research universities5 success rates for biomedical and science  technology grant funding is at an alltime low currently grant funding rates across the national institutes of health and national science foundation are at their lowest percentages in history see the dotted line on the figure at this drug monkey post  at the nih many institutes are funding at the 11th percentile and i’ve seen some in singledigit percentiles one is permitted a total of total of two submissions such that overall funding rates can sometimes approach 20 writing each grant generally takes four to six weeks but you don’t learn the grant scoring for three months the actual funding possibility until six months or longer if congress is dragging their feet and see the actual funding at nine to 12 months in many cases it can be over two years or never between conceiving an idea and seeing research support the result is that this is the first time in 20 years that i’ve seen more than three people i know giving up their laboratories and moving on to 100 teaching positions or other careers entirely that’s okay from the standpoint of personal satisfaction but the federal medical research enterprise has made tremendous investments in individuals it’s a terrible waste to see welltrained scientists leaving the academy the system also penalizes women for being the gender that gives birth to our future citizens the “tenure clock” normally doesn’t get delayed if one has a child and takes maternity leave some granting agencies are now allowing applicants to note that they may have had a break in productivity because of family or health issues but by and large women are not treated kindly by the system and just in case you think 80 of science professors are complaining consider this one of the 2012 winners of the nobel prize in chemistry lost his funding from a private research institute a few years ago his work could not move forward because he had to let some research staff go fortunately his wife is a scientist and has been working with him through thick and thin he lives in a highcost market and had to pick up side work he was fortunately a physician to be able to make his mortgage now he has a nobel prize but most of us don’t6 many us universities operate under a customer service model while accepting students unprepared for collegelevel coursework“the customer is always right” didn’t always apply to universities many places still require that students assume substantial personal responsibility for success but i’ve seen some state universities kowtowing to student demands that undermine academic integrity we’re even seeing helicopter parents contacting professors directly about their kids’ grades disclosure is against federal law and complaining to department chair and deans the default reaction from administration is that the professor is at fault professors are also penalized if their course grades have too high of a percentage of d’s and f’s at the same time some of the same universities are allowing students to enroll in college with sat scores of 800 or below — for combined math and verbal components even among populations that might not have the luxury of taking standardized test prep scores that doesn’t account for the 300 or so more points that may of us establish as the minimum i scored an 1120 by the way so i was no genius too many professors are being expected to make up for the deficiencies of public high school education7 increasingly reliance on adjunct teaching faculty for teachingintensive institutions a new tactic to cut costs is to hire temporary faculty to teach courses rather than paying a professor 80000 plus benefits you can now hire from the ranks of unemployed scientists a nobenefits ph d at 30004500 per 3 credit hour class per semester i have seen some tenuretrack faculty actually be threatened by their supervisors with being replaced by such adjunct faculty if they can’t score grant funding the abuse of adjunct faculty by us universities is a travesty8 the public and some university administrators underestimate teaching effort if i teach a 3 credit hour class it may appear that i’m only working 3 hoursweek however developing and updating course material takes time especially in rapidlychanging fields like mine pharmacology at one of my former universities we had a defined formula that i quite liked and agreed with you get eight hours of time for each one hour of lecture time if it’s brandnew material and four hours of time for each one hour of lecture given if it’s an existing course those numbers are about right in my experience you also have student office hours of four to eight hours per week time grading assignments  much more timeconsuming now that i’ve become a writing professor and exams and professional development time where one might attend a seminar or offcampus conference to learn about your field of study so a 3 credit hour class can easily take 1520 hoursweek depending on the school a fullload might be two or four classes so it’s pretty easy to get to 3040 hoursweek with just two classes the average prof works about 60 hoursweek so uh yeah that’s a 50 effort9 administrators underestimate online teaching effort if you’re already teaching the class it’ll be nothing to throw it up online right universities are increasingly moving classes to online offerings a genuinely useful approach for students working fulltime unfortunately some universities are simply stressing online classes because it brings in revenue without significantly increasing infrastructure costs professors are usually given less credit for online courses than for those inperson most professors i know who teach online classes say that much more effort is required for online classes10 administrators overestimate the need for administrators i know that accreditation guidelines safety development grants and research compliance and other administrative issues require dedicated administrative personnel jobs that used to be done by one person now often seems to require two or three and we’re seeing the number of assistant associate vice deans for whatever increasing over the last five to seven years i used to be part administrator — i’d get additional salary for that but not for increased teaching or university service — so i guess that i used to be part of the problem oh and why not 1111 “tenure” is no longer tenure tenure is a hotbutton item particularly for critics of state universities indeed tenure had its purpose in allowing academic freedom of thought and opinion without institutional retaliation some people think it’s no longer necessary but it is particularly given the substantial dependence of universities on salary support for faculty most universities have also instituted more stringent posttenure review processes generally about every five years i’ve rarely seen a tenured professor be fired but a professor with tenure who is deemed unproductive by whatever anonymous review can certainly be made to wish they didn’t have a job now i’m not saying that being a university professor is harder than highly dangerous jobs like being an oil rig worker steel worker logger soldier or deep sea commercial fisher but i believe that susan adams was misguided and irresponsible in using career cast as a source in her initial post her large audience on this highprofile platform reflects some of the difficultly university faculty face with regard to public perception i expect more of any forbes contributor like me or my science writing compatriot emily willingham but certainly much more from a longtime forbes staff writer i know that i’ve stressed the biomedical side based on my personal academic experience so what
