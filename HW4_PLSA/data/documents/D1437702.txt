innocent caring and thoughtful she does everything to keep her loved ones safe from a she is protective of her friends and shows her fierce side when defending them hannas sarcasm and sense of humor often makes her come across as ditsy however she is actually quite smart and bright her strong instinct has often led her to find many a clue about a and she also scored well on the sats hanna tends

beautiful heart shaped face complimented with piercing baby blue eyes full lips and dimpled smile she has a curvaceous frame with slim shapely legs her golden blonde hair was long she cut it short before the start of senior year in season 3 her skin is light with a milk and rose complexion which sums up her innocent and playful personality in season 5 hanna again after alison comes back cuts her hair short with black highlights and has a curvy body hanna does this because she doesnt want to look like alison or be associated with her but still has to help cover and take care of her prior to the  pilot  hanna was a larger form of herself and because of her increased weight gained the nickname hefty hanna from alison  series pilot the series begins with footage of the night alison di laurentis disappeared alison aria montgomery spencer hastings hanna marin and emily fields were having a sleepover in spencers barn alison had scared them by sneaking up on the other girls in the barns doorway they had laughed and joked about it and sipped drinks with alison later aria had awakened followed by hanna and emily to find ali and spencer missing spencer had returned to let the other girls know that ali was missing and that she thinks she heard a scream hanna in the pilot one year later at the local mall hanna and her friend mona vanderwaal are shopping hanna bumps into spencer and takes the opportunity to catch up with her she then shoplifts a pair of super expensive sunglasses while mona shoplifts a scarf just then a security guard follows hanna out of the store but to hand her bag which she forgot inside hanna smiles mock innocently and her and mona leave scared but relieved at school the formerly chubby gawky hanna has become the new queen bee alongside formerly nerdy sidekick mona who has had a glam makeover of her own in english class hanna picks up on the weirdness between mr fitz and aria her first a text that night the police show up at hanna marins doorstep busting her for shoplifting the expensive sunglasses from the local mall they caught her using the security tapes at the precinct she almost munches on candy corn to calm her nerves until  a  sends a mocking text alluding to her overweight days at this point all four girls have been messaged by a the man on the case detective wilden has his sights more set on her newly single mother ashley marin hanna is waiting in the station when ashley prompts hanna to get up and leave outside the station dozens of cop cars are seen rushing somewhere with their sirens on in the car ashley scolds hanna for her mistake reminding her daughter that rosewood is unforgiving of damaged reputations she gleans from hanna that she did it to get her fathers attention not because she couldnt obtain the merchandise on her own ashley lets hanna know that she will take care of the situation and tells hanna to admit nothing later that night hanna stands in a crowd surrounding alison di laurentis old house with spencer and aria and they look on as a body bag rolls past on a stretcher back at home hanna sits on the couch eating ice cream eyes glued to the television set as the news report of alis resurface unfolds apparently her body was found under the gazebo in the backyard which had been under construction the summer before when ali had gone missing suddenly ashley loudly enters the house with darren the two kiss animalistically she then climbs the stairs with him leading him to her bedroom turning to exchange eye glances with hanna who watches guiltily frozen on the couch at the funeral hanna sits in the front pew with spencer emily and aria the four friends reunited under such grim circumstances hanna sips from a flask and aria receives a text message the other three tense up waiting to hear who the text is from and they all realize the mysterious a has been contacting all four of them spencer turns and gasps when she spots jenna marshall being escorted down the aisle no one expected jenna to come to alis funeral after the service darren wilden introduces himself to the liars though hanna needs no introduction he tells them that he will be reviewing their statements and watching them during this murder investigation all four girls get a text that a will also be watching the jenna thing the pretty little liars sit at the apple rose grille that night discussing the new messages from  a  that they are receiving as well as alisons disappearance they also discuss their fears that  the jenna thing  will be revealed but spencer believes that no one knows the truth about their carefully guarded secret hanna pours some liquid from her hip flask into her beverage to her friends disapproval spencer reveals that ali had confided in her that she had been dating someone that summer an older boy who had a girlfriend but ali never told her who just then the girls cringe as they hear a tapping sound instinctively knowing that blind jenna marshall has entered with her walking stick they silently get up and leave the next morning ashley and hanna get ready for their day in the kitchen suddenly detective wildens face appears on the news cast discussing the finding of alison di laurentis body ashley promptly shuts it off and asks hanna is shes up to attending school that day hanna nods and ashley tells her not to let the news reports get into her head hanna apologizes for the cop but ashley reassures her daughter that she wont see him again at school an announcement is made over the loudspeaker calling emily aria spencer and hanna to the principals office the girls are slightly panicked and a mocking text from a doesnt help their nerves any at the office darren wilden interrogates the girls about alison di laurentis disappearance reviewing their stories with great skepticism that he makes sure to show the girls answer unanimously but he is sure that they are lying all the same claiming that their story sounds rehearsed at lunch the girls fret that their lies will get them in trouble they try to rationalize that the secret they are hiding is unconnected to alis murder but at the same time their secret reveals that ali had enemies people who could have potentially wanted to hurt her almost on cue jenna walks into the lunch room the tapping sound of her walking cane unmistakable aria invites jenna to sit with the girls in the cafeteria and so the five of them share the most awkward lunch ever as jenna notes the dead silence on the part of the girls and the fact that alison is no longer with them they all flashback to the accident that blinded jenna in the flashback it is revealed that one night when the girls were trying on clothes ali claimed she spotted toby cavanaugh spying on them so ali hatched a plan to drop a stink bomb in his garage for teaching him a lesson though the others were reluctant ali had then ordered spencer to pass the lighter and ignited the stink bomb opening the door of the garage and tossing it inside but the prank went terribly wrong as the garage caught on fire and ali saw too late that someone  jenna  was inside as a result jenna was permanently blinded from the accident and ali made sure that toby falsely took the blame for it while at lunch the girls phones go off and of course it is from a letting them know shehe is privy to their guilt while sean ackard is over at hannas the two sit down to study but hanna has other things on her mind she refills seans drink and starts necking him but he resists her moves as much as possible frustrated she sits down and asks him if he likes her as more than a friend he replies in the affirmative and kisses her on the lips basically hanna has come to an impasse with sean on when to lose their virginity because of his religious beliefs just then ashley walks through the door chatting with sean who she clearly approves of then darren enters with takeout for dinner hanna is totally annoyed and sean is asked to leave the next day mona and hanna are walking out of the mall flanked with plenty of shopping bags the two girls are happily chatting about the days finds when suddenly they catch sight of darren standing in the parking lot mona reassures her friend that he has nothing on her as she purchased everything legally hanna agrees and walks over to darren to tell him to back off she will pay off her debt for the sunglasses if he will only leave her mother alone but darren is following hanna for reasons other than her shoplifting he admits that he is stalking her because he believes that she is hiding who killed alison di laurentis hanna is speechless and resentful to kill a mocking girl the girls decide to erect the memorial in the woods near the kissing rock where they used to hang out with ali when emily and spencer bring up darren wilden that creepy detective hanna goes silent clearly upset the girls dont pick up on that though but they think hanna is crazy when she mentions that she thinks ali is still alive just then they hear someone in the forest and a few seconds later all four phones buzz with a new text from  a  telling them shes hunting them the next day at the marins  hanna is sickened to find detective wilden opening her fridge shirtless with only a towel wrapped around his waist ashley comes downstairs offers to make breakfast and sends darren upstairs to put clothes on hanna is upset that her mother is pandering to darren when they dont even eat breakfast but ashley points out that the police have not dropped the charges yet so she cant kick darren out yet frustrated hanna leaves at school mona and hanna discuss their recent shoplifts when sean and noel kahn walk over they announce noels blowout cabin party planned for the next night after they leave mona questions hanna about when she is going to have sex with sean and hanna reacts frustrated jenna walks by with her brother toby and his reappearance at rosewood high comes after a mysterious yearlong absence leaves the girls to wonder whether he had anything to do with alison’s disappearance or if he is in fact the omnipresent a then detective wilden appears to talk to hanna she tries to protest that she has class but he has already taken care of that in the office darren brings up hannas ugly duckling past and the fact that hanna started to dress more like alison hanna argues that alison helped her make those changes but darren is trying to portray her as the jealous fat girl who bumped off alison to get ahead hanna flashbacks to the time in her chubby days when she asked sean out to a party he had accepted after pressure from alison darren says he needs information about the past so hanna brings up his party boy drinking past as a comeback she then accuses darren of getting his information from her living room while he was halfnaked and walks out at noels party sean is playing foosball with his friends hanna is totally annoyed by how much she feels sean is ignoring her so she takes sean to a private cabin room where she starts passionately kissing him hanna starts rummaging through her purse for a condom but when sean catches sight of it he gets up and the two start arguing sean says he doesnt want to have sex with her and calls hanna desperate to prove something hanna is totally hurt and turns away sean tries to comfort her by giving her his jacket but she snaps at him not wanting him to see her tears he leaves and she falls to the floor crying sean resumes his place at the foosball table and hanna gets a text from a mocking her for being a loser that cant score a guy the anger and embarrassment builds to a crescendo and hanna grabs seans keys and heads for his car mona sees her friend angrily marching across the lawn and getting into seans car she tries to stop her but hanna doesnt even turn her head she speeds off with seans black sports car she later climbs out of the crashed car which wont stop beeping the next day the girls reconvene in the woods to memorialize alison in the shed they used to play in spencer lets the other girls know that alison had something on toby besides him being a supposed peeping tom the other girls are surprised to find this information out from her so much after the fact the girls change their minds and decide to pick a more public place for the memorial they hear something with them in the forest again and this time they all run as soon as they hear it the person gets away but they do find the same friendship bracelet alison was wearing the night she disappeared perhaps planted by whoever was in the forest with them can you hear me now hanna gets lectured by her mother who says she never wants to see another cop car in front of the house again going along with their new plan the girls map out the details of alisons new memorial park bench spencer then comes up with the idea of aproofing she blocks all messages from people she doesnt know and does the same with the other girls laptops and cellphones the girls also appreciate the view when mr fitz rides buy on his bicycle wearing shorts just then a crunched up missing alison flier blows towards them with a celebratory remark about her death at school hannas father calls telling her that he is coming to rosewood she suspects that it is because hes heard of her crashing seans car but doesnt have the guts to ask him directly in spencers room hanna tries on outfits for dinner with her father that night spencer reveals the trouble she is in with melissas stolen essay hanna also asks if spencer peeked to see if she got any a messages but spencer has not and neither has hanna later that evening tom shows up at hannas house to take her out to dinner ashley was under the impression that she was invited to dinner as well and clearly dressed for the occasion she tries to hide her disappointmenthurt when he breaks the news that he intended to take only hanna outside tom makes a comment about his car being new and therefore he should drive and hanna freezes realizing that he is only there to see her because of the incident with seans car he agrees but asks to her to indulge him all the same and after a pause she goes along with him the next day hanna happily retells the details of the past night to the other pretty little liars how she had spent quality time with her father and he had listened she has another dinner date set with her father that night and hanna talks about visiting maryland more to see him the bell rings and ezra begins his english class hanna seems to pick up on the awkward tension when mr fitz accuses a student of not understanding the book while vehemently defending arias interpretation that night tom brings more than hanna bargained for to dinner he starts off the evening having a conversation with his daughter about how she is doing but then interrupts it to beckon two people over to them a new fiancé with a daughter hannas age to boot tom kisses both women and hanna is flabbergasted though polite during dinner kate is telling a story about her sailing hanna smiles politely isabel suggests that kate could teach hanna how to sail and hanna makes a joke that nobody gets tom awkwardly uses that moment to embarrass hanna and bring up seans car and the deal hes made with mrs ackard which is to have hanna work in her dental office in order to pay off the damages hanna then gets an sos text from spencer spencer walks wren to his motel room and before she leaves the two kiss with hanna watching in the car he invites her in but she doesnt take it that far suddenly a dedicates a radio song  i dont need you anymore  to hanna on the channel that hanna happens to be listening to hanna is freaked out hanna and spencer return to spencers home and find a message scrawled in lipstick on her vanity it wont be that easy bitches spencer sends an sos to emily and aria and the girls survey the vanity together the alison bracelet has not been touched and the broken flower pot downstairs has creepily been arranged to look like a tombstone still reeling from the haunting message scrawled across spencer’s vanity the next morning the girls discover an additional even spookier message from a – this one in the form of a video of the girls the previous night that was clearly recording them from inside spencer’s closet it is sent in a text to hanna as an attachment the girls reveal that they have unblocked their phones they then go upstairs and open the closet to find the lipstick that was used to write the message on the vanity  aria thinks it is the same shade of red that jenna wears as a penance for crashing sean’s car hanna is forced to take a filing job in his mom’s dental office working with kids on her way from work her shopping bag containing her uniform sneakers and at that moment she bumps into sean sean lets hanna know that he tried to take the blame for the car but hanna owns up to it herself she brings up going with him to homecoming and he says hell think about it just then a blonde cheerleader picks up sean to drive him to school while on her way to work at dr ackards office hanna spots jenna in the buildings elevator she applies that same shade of red lipstick leaning into the mirror as she applies a fresh coat hanna follows her to her floor and she has been seeing a psychiatrist in the same building as dr ackards practice later jealous of seans new interest in this cheerleader checks out her social networking page her name is amber and hanna totally resents her ashley reassures her daughter that sean isnt necessarily dating this girl just because she has been driving him to school hanna also fills ashley in on the fact that tom is engaged and she is somewhat taken aback just then a sends a shocked hanna an attached file of maya and emily kissing in an email spencer and hanna sit at the grille discussing about the lipstick just then emily walks by and they fill her in later the waitress hands emily the mixed cd leaving hanna to believe maya made it for her and encourages emily not to bullied by pursuing a nonconventional relationship ashley discusses relationships with hanna at home after bumping into sean on her way to his mothers office hanna finds out that amber is not seans love interest she is a fellow member to real love waits the virginity club at school sean expresses to her that he never meant to let her down hes just serious about his abstinence pledge so hanna decides to keep close tabs on sean by joining his abstinence club in order to spend time with him hanna spencer and emily arrive at arias to console her with chinese takeout and rag mags – thinking she’s sullen from her parents marriage troubles while discussing their plans for homecoming dance the girls open their fortune cookies to find another prank from a notes cluing them into the fact that he or she will be attending homecoming as well at school hanna attends a real love waits meeting to keep an eye on sean and his new friend amber there hanna finds an unlikely friend in lucas gottesman the members are asked to role play situations in which they would be pressured to have sex sean and amber pair off with sean convincingly acting the part of the instigator who wants to go all the way with amber and amber refuses accordingly hanna is called to take a turn  with lucas unenthusiastic she pretends to ask lucas upstairs to her room and after initially refusing to play along he then says yes making hanna finally smile and sean see red at lunch spencer urges hanna to try and steal jenna’s file from the psychiatrist’s office that’s in the same building as where she works certain that it contains the key to the identity of a or at the very least what the cavanaughs are hiding they then catch sight of toby who temporarily picks up his shirt long enough for the girls to spot a tattoo that says 901 free at last presumably memorializing the date alison disappeared but they havent put this together yet then hanna makes a false move in nudging maya to attend homecoming and makes a comment that emily wants her to come after school hanna goes to mrs ackards office building to try and sneak into the psychologists office but there are workers doing construction there so she rigs the door so that they can get back in later over the weekend hanna visits arias house later to get ready for homecoming she comforts aria about her family situation and unsuccessfully tries to get her to admit who shes crushing on hanna assumes it is a boy in iceland and insists she move on at the dance hanna and spencer joke with aria that they will share their dates with her mona and hanna get into a heated argument when mona makes nasty comments to lucas who has come to photograph the dance for the yearbook hanna greets him warmly but mona shoos him away after he leaves the two argue over whether popularity is more important than befriending nerds then toby and emily arrive at the door shocking the other plls emily is particularly surprised by hannas reaction as she had seemed so supportive of emily following her heart hanna then confesses that she had thought emily was referring to maya but before they can continue their conversation toby appears the girls try to enjoy by dancing with their dates but then spencer calls them to convene convincing hanna to go steal the file she commissions aria to keep sean occupied on the dance floor while hanna slips out to his mothers office building outside hanna sees lucas leaving early as well so she gets him to give her a ride to the office he confesses that he had come to the dance in order to take photographs and also to cast his vote for her as homecoming queen hanna is the homecoming queen but she misses being crowned so sean is photographed standing alone she did manage to find the file though hanna returns to school with the file and she spencer and aria read it they realize what information alison blackmailed toby with the night of the jenna thing  tobys sexual relationship with his stepsister assuming that this was tobys motive for murder they send emily a text message warning her that toby killed alison then set out to find her they shout emilys name while searching the hallways eventually they find her cell phone in the chemistry lab along with an upturned lab table broken beakers and blood on the floor they fear the worst the next day hanna joins emily in her room while spencer and aria try to convince emily to come forward to the police hanna whips out tobys psychological profile from her pocket she had tried to return it but when she arrived at the office she saw cops looking for that very piece of evidence while hanna and emily are alone emily finds out from hanna why she had thought maya would have been her date to the dance hanna confesses that she saw the picture of them kissing and finds out in turn from emily why she went with toby and not maya emily admits that shes afraid of everything changing hanna finds herself increasingly attracted to the geeky different lucas who takes photos of the discordant sean and hanna as a belated homecoming royalty shot for the yearbook lucas takes several shots of the two perhaps purposely annoying sean with his suggestions such as to have hanna pose sitting on his lap sean smiles through gritted teeth and the shoot ends in a bitter argument between hanna and sean the girls without emily head toward the shed to hide toby’s file that hanna stole but in a panic aria decides to throw it in the river instead – moments before emily finally gets through to their cell phones pleading with them not to destroy it all the while the girls bicker panicked and in the process hanna complains that only she gets caught for her mistakes unlike spencer who got away with stealing melissas essay hanna had to pay bitterly for shoplifting later lucas and hanna bond over funny internet videos lucas confesses how intimidated he used to be by hanna when she was still a part of alisons group he reveals how much it had hurt that alison called him hermy the hermaphrodite and hanna shares how alison had called her hefty hanna lucas cant understand how hanna had been her friend the girls all gather in emilys room and emily tells them she saw tobys motorcycle all smashed up and jenna in tears on her porch while processing this news with her friends she receives a text from a thanks for getting toby out of my way they thought they were done with a but apparently not aria spencer emily and hanna begin to prepare for alison’s memorial the memorial sparks memories of a summer day that the girls had spent lounging by the shore of the lake ironically the girls had spoken about immortality and the fantasy of living in this moment forever alison had said that one could attain that only by dying young and leaving behind a beautiful corpse getting into it alison had romanticized how fabulous it would be to die in a mysterious way at home the marins financial woes grow deeper evidenced by one of hanna’s credit cards being declined ashley lets hanna know that adjustments need to be made until their situation improves hanna steps up and decides to help out in a rather unorthodox and unhanna way she agrees to put up a lot of her old clothes and handbags up for auction online at the suggestion of her new ally lucas they must contend with alison’s older brother arriving in rosewood a changed man – the formerly gawky and gothic outsider is now as polished as a preppy politician and he’s got plenty of plans for the memorial of his own jason surprises the girls with news that jenna has asked to speak at alison’s memorial and he’s agreed to let her much to their dismay at school hanna and sean have made up though sean is still wary of her hanging out with lucas even if it is for yearbook hanna lets aria know that seans friend noel wants to ask her out and tries to convince her to double date after school though reluctant at first aria eventually accepts officer wilden returns visiting hanna while she works on yearbook he tries to intimidate her into revealing tobys whereabouts which he suspects she might know being emilys friend the possibility is farfetched and it is revealed that officer wilden is desperate to make progress in alisons murder investigation jasons return has put extra pressure on the rosewood police force to finally solve this case hanna coolly responds to his harassment threatening to mention to jason how officer wilden used to parade around her house in a towel while lucas is helping hanna she remembers who else alison had picked on that summer day when lucas had run in front of them to pick up his toy motor boat she had incessantly made offensive comments to him finally hanna had exclaimed hey as if to stand up to alison and stop her from teasing him but she recoiled and sat silent alison then turned on her warning her to never let a moment pass as lucas trudged away later at hannas house hanna pushes an uneasy aria closer to noel kahn then lucas briefly stops by giving sean pause hanna claims it is for yearbook but really lucas has dropped off the cash proceeds from hannas old handbags when ashley comes home she is stunned to see a fully stocked fridge and is upset to learn that hanna sold her belongings she expresses appreciation but asks hanna never to do it again as it makes her feel inadequate as a provider at the memorial the girls are stunned by the sudden reappearance of ian melissa’s ex but even more surprised when jenna takes the stage as they wait with bated breath and anxiousness as to what she will say or worse yet spill  in the end she offers quite possibly the kindest words for their dearly departed friend whether her moving speech was actually sincere the pretty little liars can’t be sure because it could just as easily be another trick up jenna’s sleeve after the memorial jason stops by spencers house to thank the girls to give them a gift  the alison friendship bracelet alison had been wearing the day of her death the girls quickly realize that the beaded alison bracelet that they had found must have been a fake fashioned by someone like a spencer aria and hanna study for the sat while a storm brews in rosewood the next morning veronica escorts the girls into rosewood high leery of why the test is going to be administered as planned with a hurricane brewing outside hanna and lucas grow closer as lucas continues to score hanna big bucks selling her used accessories on the internet but mona is not enthusiastic about this new relationship development and mercilessly taunts lucas calling him hermie and shim names had alison made up later fed up hanna pulls mona aside and calls her a hypocrite for treating someone of lesser social status so heartlessly when they used to be on that same strata themselves soon they all run into detective wilden bearing shocking news somebody has trashed alison’s memorial and he’s there to investigate the girls cover for emily without knowing why they lie about emilys whereabouts the night before and claim that she was studying with them although they are weirded out by emilys secretiveness about what she was really doing when even they dont know the truth they continue studying in the library emily goes off by herself later while they are all in the locker room wilden hustles emily into an empty classroom to question her although uninvited the other girls follow suspicious of the detectives shadiness there he accuses emily of trashing alisons memorial and even casts aspersions as to whether she murdered alison he pulls out the detached pieces of alisons memorial and exposes emilys letter to her friends flustered emily confesses that she loved alison as more than a friend but never intended any harm towards her she felt bad about the mean things she wrote in that letter and went to alisons memorial seeking closure and forgiveness by the time she arrived it had already been vandalized and she took the figurines from the statue in her bag because they were the only pieces of the memorial that werent broken just then veronica walks in outraged that the girls safety has been compromised when they should be in the locker room during this storm she gives detective wilden a piece of her mind and blasts him for trying to interrogate minors without an adult present the girls are quick to chime in and exclaim the absurdity of accusing sweet emily of murdering alison never mind stealing her bag without a search warrant it seems that detective wilden will be off the case at school mona hand delivers invitations for her camping birthday party on saturday to select friends in the hallway of course hanna plans to go but the rest of the girls are not planning to attend monas party not caring for attitudedriven mona all that much they apologize to hanna but then a sends a message that she will also be in attendance and that the party is a scavenger hunt for her after school hanna discusses with her mother their strapped financial situation ashley doesnt want to reveal just how deep their money problems are but hanna gets an idea when she presses redial on the house phone to hear that she just called the delinquent accounts department of a mortgage company then mona comes over hoping to convince hanna to ditch school with her and celebrate her birthday by going shopping at designer stores and having lunch at rive gauche ashley though tight on cash proudly forks over 100 to her daughter when she hears hanna refusing to join mona based on the fact that things have been tight for them lately she expresses disapproval over the idea of ditching school though at school the girls are called to the principals office once again for questioning by the police this forces hanna to text mona that she has to back out of their shopping date as she is forced to sit in the office at school mona had warned her that she wouldnt be forgiving if hanna backed out and sure enough mona texts back screw you then an fbi agent named agent cooper arrives she has been enlisted as the representative of the fbi to assist the rosewood police in the murder mystery her approach in questioning is far milder than that of officer wilden she does not seem accusing rather wanting information she shows them footage sent by an anonymous source to the rosewood police department of alison on the day that she disappeared in the video she is calling to someone a guy and teasing him that he wants to kiss her she asks the girls to provide as much information as they can to illuminate the finding the girls are cooperative hanna ever the fashionista lets agent cooper know that she is positive that the sweater alison takes off in the video did not belong to her later hanna is abruptly dumped from the guest list of mona’s birthday party because she ditched mona and also due to an alleged text sent by a to mona spreading the rumor that hanna got liposuction to lose weight apparently the rumor made its way to more than just mona because an overweight girl randomly approaches hanna and asks who her doctor was hanna laughs it off to this stranger but not to mona mona is so upset she even embarrasses her former friend in front of naomi and riley as she disinvites her from the party at least spencer and emily are supportive and comfort hanna about the falling out it is ironic that hanna mentions that mona was her friend when the girls were no longer and now that she is in a fight with mona she has them to fall back on cant she have both at spencers house spencer confides to her friends that she had kissed ian and after the two broke up she had dated ian for a while early last summer the girls are understanding unlike alison had been speaking of alison the girls suddenly see alisons photograph on the television screen the report is talking about a sweater found in alisons home with a matching blood stain it is then revealed that the police have issued an arrest for toby cavanaugh being wanted for alisons murder the girls are led to believe that toby was alisons mystery boyfriend since the sweater was identified as his that evening the girls plan to attend the party at the rosewood camping grounds and hanna plans to secretly stake out the woods near the party should a rear his or her head at the party hanna is on lookout with binoculars in the woods she sees a car pull up and someone get in she strains to see in the dark and realizes it is mr fitzs car and aria just got into it sure enough a figure hanna assumes to be the elusive a shows up and writes i see you in the condensation on the back windshield hanna tries to get a hold of aria to warn her but aria is deep in conversation with ezra and doesnt pick up her phone hanna texts the girls i know who a is and directs them to meet her in the parking lot hannas discovery yields possibly fatal results because when she gets to the parking lot and spots the girls she’s quickly hit and flung over the top of an unknown car whose driver doesnt stop to assess the damage the girls rush to her side and call 911 a text from a reveals that shehe is responsible hanna knew too much the next morning hanna wakes up in the hospital with her mother by her side hanna asks about her friends and her mom tells her that the girls were there the night before along with sean and lucas mom is of course concerned by this nerdy acquaintance her daughter has made but seems placated to hear that hes nothing more than a yearbook colleague the other girls come to the hospital to see hanna but first they have to get rid of ashley so that they can talk candidly once hanna manages that she reveals two bombshells she discovered that aria is involved with ezra and that noel must be ―a she witnessed noel run up to ezras car while aria was inside and write i see you on his windshield albeit without signing it from a later hanna wakes up from a bad dream and gets creeped out by the teddy bear staring at her then mona comes in waving a white bra as a peace flag mona tells hanna that she admires her for taking a bow after puking on a trampoline during a backflip its the reason she wanted to be her friend mona feels guilty about the fight they had and the two quickly resume their friendship next mona breaks out makeup to make hanna look fabulous again that night hannas door creepily opens until is revealed that it is just lucas coming to visit her he leans over to kiss her on the forehead while she sleeps after he walks away hanna opens her eyes because she was totally awake and knew that he kissed her the next morning hanna wakes up to see ashley standing over her hanna tells her mother that she doesnt need a private room since it’s expensive hannas mom makes up something about a temporary bank loan to placate her daughter after that hanna has a painkillerinduced hallucination or is it – as our favorite troublemaker donned in a candy striper outfit drops subtle hints about her disappearance that fateful night hanna tries to ask her what happened but all alison will say is that the four of them combined already know the truth she says that she finds a to be a bitch and tells hanna that she needs to do something about her she also says that it is dangerous for her to come but she did it for hanna worried about her being in the hospital after she leaves hanna spots a styrofoam cup near her bed with a berrycolored lipstick stain on the rim matching the exact shade of lipstick alison is wearing during her visit in the afternoon lucas brings hanna vanilla tapioca and butterscotch pudding but no chocolate  hanna tells lucas hes a good friend when he doesnt take the hint she brings up his nighttime smooch and he confirms that it did in fact happen lucas thinks she can do better than sean and leaves her alone with her thoughts and her pudding later the girls are contemplating the possibility of a and the killer being two different people when they discover an a message on hannas cast indicating that a had visited hanna in the hospital hanna is visibly freaked out the next day the girls wheel their helpless friend hanna back into her home where she‘ll be on bed rest for a few more days before returning to school they leave to get the rest of her belongings while attempting to reach something on a high shelf she knocks some boxes down and discovers the wads of cash in a lasagna box that ashleys been hiding from her miniheist the girls return and hanna gets rid of them so she can be alone with her stack of money shes not too alone though because she gets a text from a a little while later hanna confronts her mom about the money which she plays off as a loan” ashley insists that its her problem and that hanna should just worry about getting better mona feeling guilty for dumping hanna the night she was hit decides to throw her a surprise welcome home party but it doesn’t turn out well not only does noel show up but lucas drinks too much just the sight of noel prompts hanna to have a flashback about him at a different party when alison had manipulated a girl to dump noel so aria could have him hanna tries to talk to lucas but hes too busy pounding alcohol to put up with her niceties hanna and sean are telling a story about skiing when lucas interrupts to pick a fight with sean by calling him a saint bernard lucas is clearly still upset about hanna rejecting him and makes a big scene when sean finally gets mad noel hilariously stops him by declaring its like fighting a kid that needs a telethon hanna requests an audience with lucas outside she tells him not to pick a fight with sean when hes really mad at her lucas says not everything is about her he goes off on a rant that ends with him revealing that he destroyed alisons memorial since she was such a bitch to him for so long hanna tells him shell keep it between them but that just makes him sadder because when shes nice to him it makes him like her more hanna brings up her suspicious feelings about noel to sean who just wants to party hannas not really in the party mood though alone at her house hanna hears creepy noises from upstairs she wheels around with one of her crutches and then hides in the kitchen in the dark just when shes starting to freak the out her mom comes home and asks what happened when she hears that people were over she promptly heads to the pasta box to find that their money has been stolen hanna and her mom are saddened by the fact that their stolen money has been stolen so hanna shares her sleeping pills with her mom as a condolence prize once shes alone hanna finds a note from a in one of her pill boxes promising to give the money back if she does what a says the next day as ashley drops hanna off at school sans cast hanna brings up her guilt over losing the money her mom says she already paid off their debt but now she cant invest the rest to earn enough to pay it all back then her mom insists that its only a felony if they find out meanwhile hanna finds a note attached to a benjamin franklin in her locker telling her to pick up an order for hefty hanna from lucky leons on main street hanna quickly hides the money when aria appears then lies about having physical therapy in order to avoid getting coffee with aria after school hanna has flashbacks to her heavier days while a forces her to go on a cupcake binge cruelly decorated like piglets in public to earn back more of her moms stolen money she recalls the time alison gave her advice to purge after binges to drop the pounds she eats as lacrosse jocks from school including noel look on and taunt her hanna sees this as proof of noels identity as a after hanna finishes the cupcakes she receives a text from a presumably taunting her to purge the cupcakes just then aria spots her and comes over capably getting rid of the athletes who are still oinking at her aria asks hanna why she lied about physical therapy and hanna confesses about the bulimia hanna goes to the bathroom but not to take a up on the second part of her dare instead she goes to wash her face and reaches for the paper towels the first one reads oink oink hanna followed by a few hundred dollar bills also courtesy of a at home hanna tries to sneak her hardearned cash back into the lasagna box but her mom walks in and busts her hanna claims that she found it in the bathroom at the cupcake place and mom is skeptical but not going to complain about the influx of cash hannas mom also refuses to reveal how she can tell when hanna is lying so hanna stands in front of the mirror and declares she is a virgin then says she isnt a virgin hoping to catch the difference in her demeanor the next day spencer spills the beans about melissas impending pregnancy to hanna spencer voices her suspicion about melissa sudden decision for children emily comes over and reveals that maya is being shipped off to juvie camp for three months because of the joint pam found the girls are at spencers house and aria is all smiles because a saved her relationship hanna reminds aria that a also tried to run her down but as long as ezra gets to stay in town shes happy melissa comes in and makes some pleasantries with the girls which ends in her telling the girls that she doesnt have to worry about ian looking at other women then the girls surprise emily by sneaking her away for one last romantic night between the two in spencer‘s room – with lit candles and plenty of privacy the rest of the girls go through ians boxes downstairs while emily and maya have a bittersweet farewell dance upstairs the girls downstairs accomplish nothing maya thanks them and hugs everyone goodbye while someone watches from the window after shes gone emily thanks them and hanna mentions another girl who went where maya is heading for huffing spray paint and came back as a drummer in a gospel band they then receive a shocking video no doubt from a about the night alison disappeared it is the same footage that officer cooper had shown them but theres extra in this video seconds of footage center on a smiling ian then the camera angle shifts and we hear signs of struggling alisons hand comes into the view of the lens groping the leaves on the ground as she seems to have fallen until the hand stops moving and goes limp the girls scream as they see this and hear a noise outside whoever it is runs through the woods and the girls try to chase the stalker but its gone by the time theyre outside the girls examine the video a left for them that illuminates what looks to be the final moments of alison’s life near the kissing rock the night she disappeared right after ians cameo on the video he surprises them in person as he tries to grab a latenight snack from the hastings kitchen the girls all freak out while ian makes small talk acting nonchalant so theres no indication whether he saw his face on the computer screen or not after he leaves they decide they need to hand the video over to the police at school the girls are decorating for the schools upcoming danceathon but take a break to discuss whether they should turn the video into the police they question as motives but emily doesnt care as far as she is concerned she doesnt want toby to go to jail and this video could prevent that aria agrees with emily and offers to drive spencer to the police station during their lunch break later hanna tries to get a job to alleviate the marins financial strife she asks sean if she can work for his mother as a dental assistant again but sean says no because last time she threatened a kid with a drill bit for aiming his spit at her sean is suspicious of why she needs money and cant get it from her mother so she makes up an excuse about wanting to save up for some expensive earrings she tries to get a job with a local store clark who is also a family friend and finds out just how strapped their situation is when the woman lets her know that her mother owes their store money hanna offers to pay off the debt but the woman says that hanna alone couldnt pay off the debt there are not enough days in the week just then a sends hanna a text offering her money in exchange for a job  no doubt shady dealings we then see emily on the phone arguing with mayas guards at her rehab center true north the guards wont allow her to speak to her girlfriend apparently she can only receive calls from her mother and father so hanna offers up the phonehacking services of a new kid with techcred who can wire emilys phone to make it seem that she is one of the st germains when she calls maya at lunch the girls are getting ready to head to the police station when they realize that spencers laptop is missing despite the fact that it has been in her bag plastered to her side all day save when she kept it in her gym locker a notebook seems to have been swapped with her bag camouflaging the weight difference the girls deduce that it must have been taken when she left it in her gym locker which ian has access to since he is an athletic coach that night spencer and hanna wait in the coat check line at the dance and hanna shows off her hip flask meanwhile emily watches ian lock his suspicious briefcase away in his desk drawer ian checks his coat with his keys in the pocket and the girls begin to hatch a plan to get the keys and get into his desk where they think spencers laptop is clearly hidden hanna wonders if he has already erased the video but spencer says that if he did it would indicate definite guilt and that they should inform the police caleb rivers shows up with emilys newly soupedup phone and hanna calls him out for overcharging poor emily they exchange words about not knowing the first thing about hanna and he leaves hanna then gets a text from a telling her to dance with dorky lucas for 200 per dance hanna is dancing with sean but tells him she should dance with poor lonely lucas who reminds her so much of herself in her own dork days sean is not happy and claims that hanna was different than lucas because she was sweet while lucas seems deserving of a beating he then tells her if she wants to perform charity she should save a whale but sean leaves and hanna convinces lucas to dance with her as the song is over hanna convinces lucas to dance with her for just one more song which happens to be a slow one hanna then leaves lucas on the dance floor when an angered sean confronts hanna about the fact that one dance with lucas has turned into five sean is unforgiving of hannas unceremonious treatment of him and asks hanna if she brought him to the dance just to diss him hanna then gets a text from a upping her payrate to 500 a dance any chance of hanna dancing with sean again that night or possibly ever again is now gone she returns for another dance with lucas discreetly crying on his shoulder as they sway emily drinks from hannas stolen hip flask and nearly causes an accusatory scene with ian about his murdering alison spencer covers up claiming her accusation was referring to their kiss but this too angers ian who had hoped nobody else knew that damning secret spencer and hanna get emily outside and decide theyll all crash at spencers that night so emily doesnt have to deal with her mother and spencer doesnt have to be alone with ian lurking about lucas approaches hanna and offers her a ride home but hanna insists her friends need her after lucas walks off hanna finds that a did not disappoint she pulls her scarf out of her coat pocket and a fat wad of cash falls out onto the ground before they leave drunkhonest emily accuses hanna of pulling an alison leading a boy on only to break his heart hanna is guiltridden at spencers home hanna prevents emily from drunkdialing maya and puts her to bed emily starts to apologize but hanna says she was right and hanna feels bad for leading lucas on so insensitively but emily falls asleep missing hannas admission hanna removes her shoes and pulls the covers over emily when she goes downstairs hanna discovers that spencers laptop has reappeared on the coffee table under some newspaper with the incriminating video erased and a photo of alison the night she disappeared in its stead there is a message courtesy of a to accompany the pixels the picture shows alison walking through spencers backyard with a shadow in tow it seems to have been photographed from the perspective of the di laurentis house hanna notices the shadow behind alison and asks spencer if she knows who it is spencer claims not to know aria rouses the girls early in the morning from their sleep at spencers house shes been up all night analyzing the picture that a left them the girls all huddle close to aria but spencer stands aloof not quite comfortable participating for some reason aria has figured out that the picture was taken from the perspective of alisons bedroom window she thinks alisons brother jason may have taken the picture hanna notes that her mother saw him at the bank indicating that he is back in town aria proposes talking to jason but emily and hanna treat the thought of approaching him with disdain spencer quickly volunteers wanting to know if he indeed took the picture at home hanna slips some big bills into the box of popsicles in the freezer she manages to slide the door shut before her mother ashley walks into the kitchen and can see what shes up to ashley is taking a work call and she is nonchalant towards the other person on the line until she hears that a new development has been added to the schedule apparently there is a meeting previously unplanned scheduled for later that day when she gets off the phone ashley sits down heavily and lets hanna know that mrs potter the lender of their loan has made an appointment to see ashley this week but she tells hanna to go to school not outwardly panicking despite the fact that she could be busted very soon for her unauthorized loan later in the hallway hanna calls her mom worried about their family situation but ashley again instructs her to stay calm aria and spencer ask hanna about her conversation but she brushes it off then spence gives aria two tickets to a museum as her father has no use for them though hes a member aria plans to make a date night with ezra out of the tickets next hanna is notified by coach fulton that she has a weeks worth of detention for skipping gym class three times hanna tries to use ankle pain and the fact that she was hit by a car to get out of it but coach fulton points out that hanna was on her feet for hours at the dance marathon caleb sees the exchange and doesnt miss the opportunity to tease hanna then hanna opens her locker to find an envelope from a containing a third ticket to the museum opening that aria plans to attend with ezra a has commissioned hanna to give the ticket to ella montgomery thereby busting arias illicit relationship in exchange for getting her mothers cash back a fashions the order in the form of a mothers day card with a word bubble above the mother saying i need money hanna returns from school to find her pajamaclad mother asleep on a kitchen chair when hanna enters ashley stirs quickly and whimsically decides to make pancakes while shes cracking eggs she reminisces how she had saved hanna at the hospital when the doctors were stitching up her ear they had wanted to shave the hair there but ashley had insisted that the effect could be detrimental to hannas state of mind when she woke up ashley then tears up and assures hanna that she will always take care of her hanna breaks with her mother to remove the ticketcontaining envelope from her bag and jot down the name ella montgomery on the front hanna then delivers the envelope to ella montgomerys school mailbox adding a line of thanks from the rosewood pta passing it off as a token of appreciation aria then spots hanna and invites her to a joint manicure after school hanna declines using homework as an excuse which makes aria raise an eyebrow aria takes hannas glum mood to be about her breakup with sean which prompts her to mention the challenges of her own relationship with ezra while on the subject hanna suggests that aria and ezra cool off and not go to philadelphia for her date that night at first aria is confused but then she interprets hannas remarks as signs of jealousy and walks away insulted by her friend in ella montgomerys history class recalling the beginning of world war ii spencer plays hermione granger by answering all the teachers questions spencer points out that bullies can never be appeased which gives hanna pause as reflected by the expression on her face when class ends hanna hurries over to her to try and stop ella but she had already left the classroom she runs toward her calling her name but before she can follow her down the hallway coach fulton corners her and forces her into the detention classroom at detention hanna finds the company in none other than caleb while joking around with her caleb learns that hanna is trying to prevent ella from driving philadelphia he uses his phone to stage that his social worker has dismissed him from detention detention ends for hanna at 400 and she leaves the classroom with a sinking feeling then hanna visits her mother at work wanting to be there to support her when the bomb goes off but a different bomb is dropped when denise ashleys coworker interrupts the marins conversation to inform ashley that mrs potter has had a heartattack and could not be revived the lawevading women hug at the bittersweet news at school the next day hanna musters up the courage to approach aria planning to confess about almost exposing her relationship but aria is thrilled to be talking to hanna again they make up and aria gushes about her successful date with ezra hanna just goes along with aria and changes her mind about confessing hanna goes to her locker to find caleb leaning against it she compares him to barnacles making him smile he then hands her a piece of ella montgomerys car which he removed the day before when hanna finds out that caleb had helped to prevent ella from getting there she is pleased but isnt outwardly grateful she does offer him money but caleb says he wants something else he doesnt know what yet but hell think about it at night the girls are in spencers room where spencer reveals to the other girls that it was her shadow in the picture with alison she had gone after ali after the two had a fight spencer admits that the reason she had never told the girls thus far was because she had felt responsible for wishing alison dead aria wisely points out that alison had said far worse and the other girls comfort her similarly suddenly the girls all move to spencers bedroom window where they see jason di laurentis in his old house across the street looking out his own window in their direction the girls are shocked to see him inside the next day at school hanna and aria discuss the new school news someone has been breaking into the vending machines to steal food and also triggering the school alarm at 300 am in order to leave the building who would want to be in school at that hour aria then changes the subject to hannas least favorite the ticket to the art gallery hanna tries to persuade aria that the whole thing was just a weird coincidence she hurriedly leaves aria to go over to where caleb is sitting and bossily let him know that his playing with ellas car is completely confidential caleb shoots back that hanna owes him just then hanna gets a text from a warning her that a will not keep her secret even if caleb will in the library hanna takes a break from reading with emily and spencer in order to meet with caleb caleb has come up with an idea for what he would like hanna to do to repay him date him  in order to up his credibility at school and win himself some customers who will trust a guy that dates the homecoming queen reluctantly hanna arranges a time at emilys swim match the next day where she will be cheering on her friend in arias room hanna continues to try to distract aria from stressing about the gallery ticket and what would have happened had her mothers car not stalled aria then overhears her father on the phone with someone saying that he plans to meet himher in the dark aria is sure from the conversation that byron montgomery is talking to a woman and byron denies that he was speaking to ella when aria asks she is especially suspicious because he had said that he was going to a department dinner but at least byron has the sense to admit that those plans fell through arias wants hannas help in getting to the bottom of this new mystery she gets hanna to join her in stalking her father next arias suspicions of her father having another extramarital affair lead her to rosewood high school of all places hanna has the bright idea to have aria call her mother who is in the school library on the phone ella tells her daughter that she is at home and aria lies likewise unsure aria goes into the building with hanna on her heels to check out whats going on crouching inside the library they see byron and ella making out having an intramarital affair arias parents leave then while still in the library hanna notices some stuff inside the vents including clothing bags cell phones and a fat wad of cash hanna posits that this stuff belongs to a hanna then grabs the cash before being chased by a frightening figure in black aria and hanna run for their lives before hanna instinctively sprays her chaser with hairspray eventually aria and hanna realize that their pursuer is caleb who has sleeping at the school and the one who had triggered the schools alarm system the night before hanna returns calebs money to him caleb even lets the girls in on his foster care situation that has driven him to find alternative places to live the next day in the hallways hanna expresses her concern over caleb living in school he brushes off her concern and asks her to make good on her deal to up his reputation so hanna helps caleb scout out the fellow rich kids in school and become acquainted with them through her in order to raise the profits of his underground business ventures she introduces him to bridget wu in exchange for caleb listing for hanna all the places that he is from the two continue like that exchanging names for information as their friendship grows during the meet hanna spencer aria and caleb sit together when caleb gets up aria and spencer express their surprise at and disapproval of hannas new buddy hanna isnt too affected after the match hanna finds caleb digging his belongings out from a school trash bin clearly the custodians found calebs stuff and disposed of them in a friendly gesture hanna offers to help caleb with his living situation she offers to let him secretly crash in her basement without her mother knowing his main fear is that if hannas mom knows she will call social services landing him in an even worse situation she hands him an address and he looks like he is going to think about it then aria approaches hanna about a text from a alerting her that hanna almost got her busted somehow she is initially prepared to trust her friend before she trusts a when hanna drops the bombshell that she was the one who gave ella the ticket aria is unforgiving leaving the two at an impasse aria doesnt give hanna a chance to explain about caleb messing with ellas car at home hanna sits on the stairs trying to reconcile with aria caleb approaches her to ask if it is okay to use the towels in the bathroom after he showers apparently he has decided to take hanna up on her deal and stay over hanna mumbles an unconcerned answer and caleb detects she is upset he prods a little before hanna confesses that her mistake was not totally cleared by calebs helping pull the kill switch from mrs montgomerys car her secret role in the endeavor was exposed and shes afraid aria will never speak to her again she doesnt tell caleb all the details but he gets the point when he sees her tears hanna tells him he can leave her to shower caleb rises momentarily then sits back down letting her know that it can wait aria is still hurt by hanna’s betrayal and so decides to sit apart from hanna and the other pretty little liars while they meet up in spencers room the girls discuss the strangeness of melissas rapid change in life plans they use a website to decipher the three letters of the braille message bad aria decides it must be a joke that toby is playing on them but emily doesnt think that he would mess with them at a time like this aria then leaves in a huff completely forgetting their conversation the next day at home ashley takes the remaining cash from the popsicle box in the freezer in order to return it to mrs potters safe deposit box hanna tries to talk ashley out of it as mrs potter has no use for it anymore but ashley insists that it is the right thing to do as soon as hanna hears her mother close the door behind her she opens the basement door to let caleb out she makes him breakfast over conversation trying to make sure if he wants to go back to the foster home but soon the door reopens and caleb scatters while hanna hides his cereal bowl but calebs hat is still lying exposed on the kitchen counter when ashley walks back into the kitchen she finds hanna washing the dishes—or more precisely calebs hat in an attempt to hide it from her mother but ashely is unfazed and simply instructs hanna to wear gloves while she does the dishes at school hanna gives caleb back his soggy hat aria watches from a distance before determinedly approaching hanna to forgive her as she realizes that they’re both contending with a more evil power in a who is clearly trying to tear the friends apart she acknowledges hannas attempt to undo her mistake by pulling the kill switch on ellas car spencer aria hanna and emily sit down for lunch spencer expresses her disapproval of hannas growing relationship with caleb declaring him dark but hanna reminds her friends that they had treated toby the same way silencing them ashley agrees to go out with mr james leland mrs potters nephew to find out more about what he wants while ashley is preparing for her date in the foyer caleb comes over—through the front door surprising hanna and disconcerting mrs marin who immediately forms a negative opinion of her daughters new friend in fact ashley worries that hanna is rebounding from sean in a bad way when james comes over caleb takes the liberty of opening the door and greeting him hanna and caleb are immediately suspicious of james though for different reasons caleb claims architects dont use crappy pens which mr leland uses to sign some form that ashley presents him for the bank hanna doesnt get good vibes as she thinks the guy to be too smooth the girls shop at a clothing store where aria and hanna explain to the other two what their past quarrel was about they discuss a and caleb and hanna reveals to her friends that caleb is crashing at her house the girls express their shock but stop short when they spot jenna trying something on in the lingerie section of a department store overhearing her say to the clerk that her mysterious suitor loves lace caleb is not surprised to hear that ashley had not taken hannas warnings about mr leland being shady he is used to parents ignoring their childrens opinion he announces that he did some sleuthing on their behalf and has discovered that mr leland is not who he says he is james leland indeed an architect from syracuse died two years prior making this guy an impostor with a dark motive hanna informs ashley later but she is loathe to do anything about it as it might draw attention to herself and the connection she has with the safe deposit box she is also not too keen on caleb being involved at night hanna thanks caleb for his help that day she walks caleb to the basement before an exterminator shows up to take care of the infestation problem in the basement clearly a wants hanna to know that she is aware that caleb is crashing there even if her mother isnt as if aria hanna spencer and emily dont have enough drama in their lives mr fitz decides to put on a school production of the awardwinning play the bad seed the story about a girl who wreaks havoc on her small town – eerily echoing our pretty little liars’ own troubles aria goes to the tryouts at 4 pm to support hanna and act opposite her with no intention of joining the play herself however the girls urge aria to be ezra‘s stage manager for the production so that she can spend more time with him the other girls in addition to mona are interested in getting parts in the play jenna enters the scene and offers to compose flute music for the play letting mr fitz know that she approves of his choice of play because she oddly finds it inspiring and thereby annoying aria the next morning at the marin household ashley grows increasingly suspicious of their lack of food as hanna has been secretly housing foster kid caleb in their basement hanna admits to having caleb over a couple of times for dinner but even that bothers ashley as she doesnt completely trust caleb caleb overhears ashleys words about him next hanna walks into the bathroom to grab something while caleb is showering ashley enters as well looking for her phone which she has put in the charger there prompting hanna to jump in the shower fully clothed so that her mother wont realize it is caleb showering not hanna she holds her hand over his mouth so he wont make noise and makes an awkward situation even worse when he catches her sneaking a peek when he turns around at play practice aria and ezra prove to have an uncomfortable awkward working relationship namely arias slipping up by referring to mr fitz as ezra while seated next to him all the girls are present as well as mona who raises an eyebrow spencer and hanna have been cast as main characters hanna and mona also catch up at play practice when mona sees caleb spying hanna she is inquisitive and hanna confides in mona about her morning shower hanna does not make much eye contact with caleb as she is too sheepish about seeing him naked suddenly ian walks into the room expressing surprise that hes in the wrong room for the varsity team practice the girls huddle close together and comment on how creepy ian is spencer flashes back to a college party alison had snuck them into with fake ids probably in an effort to spy on ian ian had been flirting with a particularly tipsy girl and had gone off with her to one of the rooms upstairs looking back the girls wish they had said something to melissa sooner about ian after school hanna sits in her kitchen making a sandwich while practicing her lines for the play caleb walks in and tries to divert her attention but hanna is cold towards him choosing to focus on anything except caleb finally hanna walks away leaving caleb with her unfinished sandwich he tries to directly ask her to help but she refuses back at play practice spencer emily and hanna review their lines and discuss the motives of their characters no doubt finding parallels to their own lives they catch sight of ian hanging around close to where they are standing prompting emily to have a flashback to the night of the party the girl that ian had left with had suddenly taken a nasty tumble down the stairs in the middle of the party they had all exchanged looks after her fall although ali had been no where in sight but ian had been at the top of the stairs in hindsight the girls are left to question whether ian had pushed that girl caleb pulls hanna aside from play practice to return jennas phone which spencer had given him and let her know that he cant hack it he tries to break hannas solid demeanor towards him directly addressing the fact that they had been in the shower together and that hannas behavior has not been the same since mr fitz ends practice for the day leaving aria spencer hanna and emily alone in the rehearsal room while packing her costume away in the prop box spencer stumbles across a trophy with ian thomas name on it spencer twirls it in her fingers seeing dried blood at the base of the trophy the trophy is from a tournament in hilton head which took place the weekend ali disappeared spencer posits that it is the murder weapon ian used to kill alison and decides to hand it over to the police along with the other liars as they leave the police station the girls make plans to sleep at emilys place except hanna who needs to go home to make sure caleb doesnt accidentally scare her mom at home hanna also gets a chance to try to patch things up  with caleb caleb sees that hanna is ignoring him and so packs up his things ready to leave her home hanna stops him but when he brings up her poor treatment of him she admits that seeing him naked caused her to avoid him he lets her know that it doesnt mean that she has to throw down too it seems that hanna was afraid of her feelings for caleb but isnt anymore the two kiss for the first time the next day at school some police officers and a detective appear the detective detective breyer approaches the liars and asks for spencer in turns out that while failures to turn evidence into the police before were mistakes in this instance reporting to the police was the mistake he lets them know that the trophy was proven to be a fake  there was no golf tournament in hilton head on that date and the blood on it wasnt human it was from a rat the girls are then taken to the police precinct for questioning on their way out from school the girls get a text from a letting them know just who was responsible for the trophy set up reflecting again on the night of the frat party aria considers the possibility that ali had been the one to push the girl and spencer concurs that it was possible that she had done it in a jealous rage because the girl had been with ian aria vividly recalls that alison had been nowhere to be found most of the night suddenly the girls look up to see ian close by slouching in front of the school entrance lazily watching them chilled the girls turn away the girls realize theyve been duped when the bloody trophy lands them in hotter water than expected with an angry police team more hellbent than ever to find alison‘s killer despite these setbacks further complicating matters is garrett reynolds a boy the girls all knew growing up in their neighborhood who‘s a police officer now and has just been assigned to the case the girls are being questioned by the police as to why they think ian is the killer each of the girls lets detective breyer know about the video footage of ian with alison spencer suggests that ian may have been into younger girls but when asked to back that claim she pointedly does not mention that she dated him as she is being interrogated while sitting next to her mother the girls parents convene in the hall after the interrogation believing they are the victims of a cruel prank the girls compare notes none of them mentioned spencers fling with ian at home hanna is having more trouble hiding caleb the latest evidence involves caleb leaving the toilet seat up alerting her mother to the fact that a boy has been in the upstairs portion of their house which is against the rules she also catches hanna making breakfast for caleb and grows suspicious when hanna tries to pass off the cereal as her own hanna and caleb come home from school and start kissing passionately they make their way to the kitchen where ashley confronts them she asks caleb to leave but hanna protests that he just arrived ashley contradicts hanna and shows them calebs backpack which she discovered in the basement she knows that hanna‘s been hiding caleb as the grocery bill has tripled and the toilet seat has been left up multiple times ashley evicts caleb from her home just as he and hanna were starting to become romantically involved caleb leaves and hanna follows slamming the door behind them that night caleb and hanna camp out in the rosewood camping grounds caleb is surprised by hanna deftness at camping and the two confide in each other about their upbringings hanna mentions her past weight problem and caleb discusses his experience with foster parents and social workers after sharing intimate stories the two share some kisses then hanna and caleb take things to the next level before falling asleep in their tent the next day after hanna comes home ashley lets her know that she was about to call the police worried about hanna but hanna snaps back at her mother surprised that she doesnt sympathize with calebs plight realizing that her relationship with hanna is very compromised ashley picks up the phone when caleb calls hannato invite him to dinner caleb comes over for dinner afterwards he goes to thank ashley who lets caleb know that he is allowed to stay but warns him not to hurt her daughter she is a bit rough with him when he thanks her pointing out that she did it for her daughter not him but on a softer note she tells him to call her ashley not mrs marin that night hanna and the others receive sos texts from spencer and the three congregate on her front lawn to find out that the rosewood police have made spencer a person of interest in the murder of alison di laurentis and have begun to stake out her house the girls are texted this information by a the next day at the marins caleb makes eggs for breakfast and ashley gets used to having a guy in the house before heading out to school hanna finds what she thinks is a present meant for her in calebs bag in the form of a jeweled owl presumably in commemoration of their first night when they heard owls in the woods at school in the cafeteria hanna shows the other girls the picture she snuck of the owl before returning it to calebs bag just then aria spots sean and paige flirting with each other as they share a table and jokes in the lunch room hanna oblivious to paiges questionable sexuality status is happy for sean to be moving on later in the courtyard aria and emily overhear caleb mysteriously speaking on the phone with someone telling that person that something cannot happen that night he keeps referring to her and it becomes clear after he mentions that he is living in her house that he means hanna the other person seems to be saying negative things while caleb is defending her when he gets off the phone aria and emily hide before caleb can see them the two interpret the phone conversation to mean that caleb is talking to another girl in a romantic way when they share their suspicions with hanna at lunch she is loathe to believe in his dishonesty however when jenna walks into the lunch room wearing the owl around her neck hanna is devastated she tries to text caleb but to no avail he isnt responding spencer then watches jenna outside who is wearing her headphones oblivious to those around her spencer figures out that the owl is a flash drive when she sees jenna insert it into her computer hanna tries to reach caleb for answers but he is m i a so she writes him a note slipping it into his locker she walks away then pauses and turns around then tries to crack the combination using 214 and it works she is furious and hashes it out with caleb when she returns home from school he says he never meant to hurt her and told jenna he couldnt help her anymore once things between him and hanna started happening she is not satisfied with this though and makes him leave the next day at school aria hanna and emily walk into the bathroom when hanna sees jenna she walks up to her and surprise slaps her across the face to emily and arias shock at least she has the decency to bend down and return jennas sunglasses to her without making her crawl on the floor that night hanna breaks down heartbroken over what caleb did to her and ashley is disheartened hanna pretends to be taking a bath but her mother knows that she is really crying alone in the bathroom the next day ashley tries to engage hanna but she is still bummed out about caleb ashley wants to know why he moved out but hanna doesnt reveal anything seeing her daughter distraught ashley offers to let hanna stay home from school but just then mona shows up mona asks if caleb is permanently gone and hanna responds in the affirmative mona then takes the blame for hannas getting hurt and wishes she had prevented him from getting so close to her friend their conversation clues ashley into some of the details of what ensued at school hanna approaches caleb where he is sitting reading at an outdoor bench caleb is hopeful that this means that they are on speaking terms again when hanna asks to sit next to him but she just confronts caleb for playing her and demands to at least know what he was supposed to be looking for caleb reveals that jenna was looking for a key though hanna has no clue why or to what caleb explains that it was related to alison caleb then asks hanna why jenna is so interested but hanna cuts him off not allowing him to be the one asking questions after she exhausts everything that caleb knows he brings up their relationship hanna nods for a moment before shrugging and strutting away in emilys room the girls congregate to discuss what jenna may have been looking for they also discuss the creep factor in caleb rifling through hannas belongings invading her privacy but aria comes to calebs defense knowing how tempting it is sometimes to go through somebody elses information such as her boyfriends web page and find out about a fiancee emily suggests coming clean to ezra about it but hanna tries to convince aria to create a page of her own posing as one of jackies past classmates in order to sneakily find out more about the status of her involvement with ezra later hanna coaches aria how to set up a fake profile and get jackie to accept her friend request hanna is at the festival setting up a booth when she sees caleb she ducks into another tent wishing to avoid her heart breaker caleb commissions mona who treats him unpleasantly to deliver the letter to hanna unfortunately mona intervenes by promising to deliver it but instead tears it up drops it in the trash can and dumps a drink on it the last line on the letter reads i love you hanna at the founders day festival ashley approaches hanna to ask whether shes seen caleb but hanna hasnt seen him ashley lets her know that caleb came over to say goodbye because he is leaving rosewood later hanna sees caleb boarding the bus out of rosewood all the while thinking he is a complete jerk to not even bother to say goodbye to her they make eye contact but she is too hurt to speak to him following her instinct emily examines a snow globe she had received from alison and at the bottom she finds a key with numbers printed on it there is also a tag attached with the name of a storage place emily aria and hanna track down the place and there they uncover a flash drive contained in a lunch box stored in a garage that alison had planted the flash drive contains secret videos mostly of the girls in intimate moments alison somehow knew that they were being spied on while she was alive there is footage of july 4 moments before the jenna thing when ali had been sure someone was spying on them in emilys room there is even some footage of jenna and the girls begin to understand what jenna was seeking in enlisting caleb to search hannas hard drive—in the footage she is seducing and blackmailing toby spencer comes up with the idea of asking jenna what she knows before taking the information to the police to incriminate ian the other liars arent so sure they dont think they can trust jenna at all but spencer is adamant the next day ashley tries to snap hanna out of moping over caleb she is surprised to hear that caleb never delivered the letter he had planned to give her the day before after class hanna asks mona whether caleb had tried to give her anything at the founders day festival mona totally lies seemingly trying to protect hannas wellbeing lucas overhears their conversation and afterwards makes a face at hanna he is still mad at her for treating him poorly at the danceathon in the school music room the little liars confront jenna about the incriminating video they found of her and toby jenna tells her story how alison had visited her at the hospital on the day that she disappeared and had threatened jenna never to reveal the truth about the jenna thing or face having her inappropriate relationship exposed alison had played footage of her seducing toby and used it as blackmail before she left jenna alison had warned her never to return to rosewood or she would bury her jenna asks what the girls are going to do with the video they assure her they’ll keep it safe – but she won’t be getting it jenna seems to be telling the truth though when she discloses what ali said to her at the hospital and they believe her given how it explains jennas seemingly strange speech at the memorial dedication at lunch spencer presents the other liars with an anonymous cell phone that they can use to anonymously text ian hanna texts him a blackmail message demanding 10000 in exchange for the videos while they plot they spot ian standing by the snack machine in the cafeteria when ian gets the text he immediately leaves the cafeteria to take care of it they set a place for ian to meet just before mona swings by to sit with them however as soon as she arrives the girls all split leaving mona by herself with her lunch tray at the meeting point the girls sans spencer get a text from a warning them to prepare though the girls arent sure for what emily takes garrett up on his offer for help and confides in him about the ian situation he shows up in his personal car wearing civilian clothes ian fails to show instead a messenger boy with a sack of cash goes in his place and officer garrett corners him he turns the messenger away without telling the girls what he has done though the girls have already caught sight of the messenger as they get into the car to join spencer emily gets a call from spencer they are able to hear her entire fight with ian at the church including his entire plan for staging spencers suicide knowing how much danger she’s in they rush to save her and dial 911 as they rush to the church they see that she is physically okay but very shaken whereas ian is dangling motionlessly entangled in the church bells ropes later the girls walk out of the church together but are stopped when officer barry maple calls them back to ask if their story is a joke he can see the confusion on their faces so he motions the girls to follow him into the church inside the see that the bell tower is indeed empty and ian’s body is nowhere to be found much of the town emerges to see what the commotion is about and rosewood is left to wonder just how much truth the girls have been telling meanwhile the girls all receive simultaneous messages as a assures the girls that this is far from over… officer garrett reynolds takes the girls in his cop car to the police station but shadily stops at an undisclosed location on the way to straighten the girls’ stories out he conveniently orders them to remove his participation from the retelling and not to mention blackmailing ian at all he claims that he is hiding the money the messenger brought and he wont be giving them any trouble most importantly he asks them to keep the videos a secret the next day the girls chill out in spencer’s room to review the events of the night they are confused about a’s motives in saving spencer’s life they go downstairs to make coffee and find all of their parents standing in spencer’s kitchen the parents seem skeptical about the girls’ story they call spencer’s accusations an obsession to pin alison’s death on ian the girls are completely defensive and their parents insist on them seeking therapy in the school hallways a few girls gossip about hanna while practically standing next to her but mona comes to the rescue and disses the girls for their pathetic gossip mongering in the therapists office hanna walks in late hoping to have missed the whole appointment but to her annoyance the girls have politely waited for her when they finally do get to talking they speak minimally aria is the most tempted to confide in the inviting dr sullivan especially about that thing but their cellphones go off scaring them with reminders of what a might do if they tell the session ends with dr sullivan remaining completely in the dark later that day hanna returns home with shopping bags full of her day’s dealings she rambles on about the sales until she catches sight of caleb seated quietly in her kitchen beside her mother but hanna isn’t thrilled and she treats caleb coldly even when he makes eyes at her she learns that caleb tried to give her a letter via mona and say goodbye he has come to apologize but hanna does not forgive him he says i love you but her mind is made up when he leaves she cries hanna goes to the grille expresses her hurt to mona for lying to her about caleb and the letter mona tries to explain why she did it but hanna is not interested just then noel arrives to bestow a kiss on mona apparently they are dating now frustrated hanna walks away the next day aria informs the crew about as new fiasco—ezras key is missing key from under the doormat and they consider a’s compulsively violent tendencies and violation of their personal space they bring up dr sullivan who is sworn to confidentiality and emily and aria are the loudest proponents in favor of cluing her in on their secrets spencer agrees and even hanna the most unwilling to see a shrink is in as she approves of dr sullivan’s fashion sense—a clear signal to hanna about her character at dr sullivan’s the girls are about to tell all emily takes out her computer to show anne the videos taken of them through the window but decide to explain the situation first aria begins to speak but is cut off by spencer who catches sight of ezra’s hollis diploma on the wall a subtle hint that a is privy to everything they say they had scheduled the appointment lastminute yet they suddenly cancel leaving dr sullivan completely baffled and frustrated with the lack of communication we later find out she believes that the girls are not benefiting from therapy by coming as a group and so recommends to their parents to have them separate for a while both during therapy and in general the girls are all devastated as their parents inform them one by one later spencer alerts the girls who must sneak out of their homes to rendezvous in the middle of the night they meet in an abandoned greenhouse where spencer tells them about the texts melissa had received—its not safe yet i cant tell you they discuss the possibility of ian being alive and texting melissa they test the texter to see if heshe knows the name ian and melissa agreed upon for their unborn child the texter answers correctly the girls are spooked but is the hooded figure watching overhead messing with them spencer did utter the name out loud before said texter gave the reply they discuss the possibility of ian being alive and how to return melissas phone before she detects it missing they hear rustling around them the door shuts and rocks are dropped onto the ceiling from above it seems clear that someone is standing atop the greenhouse observing their conversation unbeknownst to the pretty little liars spooked from the sound effects the girls flee on their way home they pass the di laurentis house where jason is standing on the curb disposing the rest of the ali memorial paraphernalia that mayas family apparently didnt have the heart to get rid of the girls are surprised to see him back in rosewood and back in his old house the next day during lunch the girls stand on line in the cafeteria together trying to discreetly catch up on each others news hanna then plops her tray down at the same table where aria is sitting but spencer protests reminding her of their forced separation hanna is defiant thinking this will only make them look more guilty and further arguing that they should stick together amidst all the confusion but in the end they opt to sit at different tables just then mona motions for hanna to sit besides her at her lunch table but hanna leaves annoyed with the girls all at separate tables a sends the girls a text mocking them for looking so lonely even after their therapist instructs them to stop socializing together our girls continue to talk to each other because there’s just so much to discussat home tom has returned to rosewood hanna has to contend with both her parents trying to convince her to do something she doesnt want to do tom warms to the therapist idea and ashley has a why not attitude but hanna has other ideas she is angriest about the not seeing her friends aspect and balks when her father suggests that the decision can be adjusted in the future she finds her fathers involvement hypocritical when he has had such little interaction with his daughter in the first place as a result her father announces that he will be sticking around rosewood for a while hanna is not impressed and walks away rebuffing her fathers attempt to endear his daughter hanna ignores monas phone messages as she does the dishes her father lightly questions her about it but she is mostly unresponsive he apologizes for hannas not being able to see her friends but calls it the right thing to do hanna then points out that she only sees him when she is in trouble not ready for her fathers return to her good graces she accuses him of abandoning her and listens placidly as he apologizes next hanna goes to the grille where mona is sitting alone ready to forgive her for hiding the letter mona is very pleased to have her friend back they agree to disagree on each others love interests noel and caleb deciding to avoid that subject altogether as their relationship heals at school the girls find ways to secretly meet by hiding in the bathroom stalls until the bathroom is empty while they discuss the latest news including the possibility that melissa is hiding ian hanna gives out hand cream which she reveals that she pilfered from the mall the girls are appalled to hear that hanna is still shoplifting but hanna wants out anyway because shoplifiting with mona is boring when someone enters they split as if being there all together is a coincidence later hanna is eating when she sees lucas and she asks him to sit down with her he reveals allowing caleb at his house at home hanna finds it surprising that ashley is pandering to toms food preferences in preparation for his return to their home in rosewood ashley tries to convince her daughter to give her father another chance even though hes made mistakes later at home tom tells his daughter about some of the differences that he is having with his fiancée though hanna isnt totally interested she also doesnt seem upset to hear that his father is having problems with isabel when hanna later sees that her father and her mother are getting along well together again she also sees a text on her fathers cell phone from isabel apologizing for something hanna secretly deletes the message in hopes of giving her parents a second chance with each other hanna also struggles to find activities outside her friends besides mona and shoplifting for a hobby together and so decides to help lucas with the yearbook at first lucas wonders why hanna is being so nice to him worried that she has ulterior motives—but hanna insists that people can change she even gets a pretty girl named danielle that lucas is so obviously crushing on to agree to a date with lucas hanna convinces danielle that she is still stuck on lucas in order to make him look good lucas is still suspicious and very nervous about hannas actions but is eventually grateful to her later the little liars spy on melissa as soon as melissa leaves the house the secretly follow her hiding behind the bushes in the yard someone pulls up late at night with his car the girls are shocked when they realize the driver getting out of the car is wren he hands melissa a closed shopping bag spencer wisely guesses it contains pain killers for ian the next day aria hanna and emily are waiting for spencer in a skeevy parking lot next to a dumpster discussing the oddness of wren and melissas rendezvous the night before spencer comes out of a pawn shop and reports the bad news  she basically stole her sisters wedding ring just then they look up to see a creepy sign for an optometrist with eyes bearing down on them as if someone is watching them and they know someone always is just then they get a text from a cluing them into who has the ring at hannas home hannas mom requires that hanna has a solo session with the therapist to hannas chagrin of course at school lucas is a total mess he is beyond nervous about his upcoming date with danielle he is persuaded to call it off but hanna pushes him not to lucas eventually gets hanna to come along with caleb to make it a double date at lunch time caleb follows hanna to try and convince her to agree to the double date with lucas and danielle hanna still disgruntled by caleb refuses but then gives in her lucas sake letting caleb know that she is only doing it for lucas at the therapists office hanna is impatient and annoyed she barely speaks to the therapist avoids opening up to her and leaves as soon as time is up avoiding the therapists request for hanna to role play what she is feeling as if alison were sitting there with them at hannas place caleb danielle and lucas have begun their evening danielle isnt enjoying the situation and suspects hanna of still being in love with lucas being that she did sell lucas on danielle by claiming that she was still into him she sees hanna as ruining their date by walking over so frequently and constantly looking lucas way misinterpreting hannas intention to see that lucas shows danielle a properly good time lucas lets hanna in on why danielle is not enjoying their date so to convince danielle that she is not interested in dating lucas hanna tells caleb to put his arm around her seeing them together calms danielles suspicions and she reaches for lucas hand the next day at the therapists office hanna tells dr sullivan her true feelings about alison in hopes of letting go her role playing makes it seem that alison is really there taunting hanna for her feelings she calls alison her best friend but also the worst enemy she ever had alison is condescending but hanna doesnt allow the mental torture to continue in her head alison says hanna wouldnt have her friends had ali not given them to her and that hanna cant live without her but mentally hanna lets the ghost know that she is over her that she wont let her into her life anymore and that she is ready to move on music sets in as if hanna has broken a spell at night just as hanna is leaving home to join the others to follow melissa her mom lets hanna in on what happened to dr sullivans office afraid because her daughter was the last person in the office before everything went down she asks hanna what they discussed but hanna is reluctant the point of confiding in the therapist is that it was confidential but hannas mom is not so sure the police could blame hanna for the incident hanna leaves in a huff frustrated by all the false accusations that never stop flying around she goes to find answers in the car on their way to find ian the girls discuss how screwed they are that they cant call the police since that only ever makes them suspicious emily wants to film this so as to prove their honesty later on from inside an old barn that melissa led wren to they hear melissa let out a gutwrenching scream and then uncontrollable sobs they run in and spencer goes to hold her for there on the floor of the barn lies ian with dried blood around the wound on his head he is holding a gun and beside him lies a letter of confession that he killed alison spencer and wren exchange horrified looks and the girls stare at the awful site before them at school the girls discuss ians death and the plausibility of him wanting to kill himself the liars are ready to move on with their lives but emily is stuck on the details not adding up to logical sense she decides to investigate independently just as the girls are talking garrett reynolds appears and based on the police report he lets the girls know that ian was dead for about a week that means that the texts sent to melissa were not from ian caleb visits hannas home to see how she is after the traumatic incident hanna is still snappy towards caleb but she softens seeing that caleb is sincere ashley returns home frazzled that hanna hasnt answered her phone revealing how much stress alisons death has placed on her leading her to worry for her daughters safety every time she leaves the house at school hanna thanks caleb for coming over she is also concerned about his foster mothers treatment of him getting money while treating caleb like garbage when she does see him and ignoring him the rest of the time caleb is touched but not interested in trying to change anything believing it hopeless but hanna is outraged especially when she later sees his mother at school blaming caleb for making her look bad when she is the one who doesnt know anything about her foster sons well being caleb retorts back but does nothing else so later hanna takes matters into her own hands and threatens janet calebs foster mom to pay up or face a lawsuit filed by her pretend lawyer mom caleb later visits hanna to thank her revealing that janet took the threats seriously and indeed paid up hannas heart is officially melted and she kisses caleb before he leaves to hang out with lucas hanna talks with her mother about the upcoming funeral experimenting with what to wear in preparation she has a conversation with her mother about ashleys fathers funeral and it revealed that although ashley paid for it she never attended and does not regret that decision the girls are summoned to another creepy midnight outing when emily gets a message instructing her to go the cemetery to visit a plot the liars join emily despite her being vague about why they are there and they end up at alisons grave then the wall across from the lights up a projector is showing the footage of alison with ian the night she died the footage they thought was lost this time after falling to the floor alison gets up giggling ian puts on his jacket gives her a kiss then turns to walk away the girls are now led to believe that ian did not kill alison and just as emily suspected ians suicide was faked on the eve of the rosewood charity fashion show aria emily hanna and spencer are folding show programs on emilys bed trying to help spencer make up for the fact that she has missed a bunch of fashion show committee meetings they discuss their love lives and the fact that hanna has recently kissed caleb though she refuses to call him her boyfriend back at the marin residence tom and ashley are cooking a farewell dinner but hanna is snappy with her father who plans to leave rosewood tomorrow she thinks it typical of him to leave in the afternoon the liars meet with jessica di laurentis for lunch despite their awkward reservations the subject shifts to jason and his moving back in and jessica reveals that she doesnt think of the house in rosewood as their familys anymore but as jason is paying for the house himself she has little choice but to respect her sons decision she then presents the girls with presents four high fashion dresses however the girls are uneasy as they remember alison having picked them out and trying them on in a flashback but that is precisely why jessica asks the girls to model those dresses in the fashion show she wants them to realize ali’s dream and pay tribute to her when the girls have a chance to think it over amongst themselves hanna is first to express the creepy factor but out of sympathy for jessica they consent they also discuss jason now that they are alone and only aria does not think that jason is being freaky she sticks up for him saying hes coping with alis death the best he can back at the marins a carefree hanna is in the kitchen dancing to her i pod when she catches sight of her dad she yells at him for scaring her she is cold towards him mentioning that he was supposed to leave although he has come with thai takeout trying to win hanna over he replies that he has decided to stay so that he wont be again leaving while she’s mad he adds that he would like to stay for the fashion show but hanna doesnt accept this explanation and accuses him of still loving her mom and staying for that reason not believing he would stay for her alone he denies it so she tunes him out after tom leaves the kitchen hanna unceremoniously throws the thai takeout in the trash at the rehearsal before the show hanna asks if anyone has a spare ticket for her dad it also becomes clear that hanna has not invited caleb to come not fully considering him her boyfriend again on the day of the fashion show hanna leaves the dressing room in search of champagne while aria questions whether cat walking tipsy is a good idea just then tom arrives on the floor for cocktails and ashley approaches tom to reassure him that the distance between him and his daughter is due to complications with hanna at this time not due to any fault of his but tom disagrees and takes the blame for the distance between them he compliments ashley on her dress and apologizes for not complimenting her enough while they were together he then asks her to dance hanna passes by at this auspicious moment and her suspicions about why her father has stayed are confirmed hanna returns to the dressing room sans champagne the liars then reveal to hanna that caleb has come to the show dressed to impress despite not being invited and they push hanna to officially get back together with caleb the fashion show starts and the outfits do not disappoint then the tribute to alison begins with her image prominent on the runway screen and the girls walking the runway in her dresses suddenly the image changes so as to make alison look like the devil with fire around and peeling black eyes the screen flashes the bitch is dead and the music changes from sentimental to hellish the audience and the models are shocked and dismayed horrified jessica leaves her seat and runs off spencer runs to noel to make him turn it off but he claims he cant she unplugs all the wires around his equipment until the images and sound effects stop immediately after the show the girls try to comfort jessica but she doesnt return their calls too disturbed for words hanna then goes to talk to caleb and finally thanks him for coming he asks to walk her home and she asks him to wait basically agreeing to the romantic possibility between them a then projects a note on the screen my dresses my game my rules at the marins hanna cuts off her dads congratulations by again bringing up the fact that he was expected elsewhere this time supposed to be in his hotel he lets hanna know that he agrees with her assessment although he previously denied it he still has feelings for ashley he admits he wants to stay for her and not pretend its for hanna at this hanna finally softens smiles and bids him farewell for the night the next day the pretty little liars stand in the kitchen talking apparently a pipe has broken in the guest bedroom so emily and hanna will be sharing a room now that emily is set to move in the subject changes to surmising about who would have done such a thing at the fashion show they realize as actions are getting bolder and it worries them they want to forget about a but it isnt so easy just then a special delivery from a arrives  a gift basket letting emily and hanna know how easy it will be to mess with them under the same roof emily moves into the marin household and to express her gratitude after her morning run makes a sitdown breakfast for hanna and her mother she sets the table and puts out real napkins and pays attention to details like separating out the egg yolks from the egg whites hanna and ashley try to assure emily that she is now a part of their family and doesnt need to act like a guest but the transition isnt so natural for emily hanna and emily then go to school together hanna meets up with caleb who has just been stiffed by someone whose phone he was commissioned to pimp out caleb acts nonchalant about his continued shady business dealings but hanna feels uneasy he brushes it off and she gives up for now that night hanna is sitting on her bed listening to music with her headphones while emily sits in the corner both are doing school work but emily cant concentrate when hanna starts singing loudly along to the music in her ears the two new roommates seem to be clashing over differences already so hanna takes off her headphones when emily complains and emily brings up calebs business deals hanna is annoyed at the question and compares emily to dr sullivan just like mike hanna puts her headphones on to tune the other out frustrated with not being able to study at hannas emily leaves for the library to study caleb then comes over and the two make use of the fact that ashley is out with her father the two go to hannas room where they talk again about calebs way of making money hanna is disapproving but then changes the subject caleb voluntarily changes it back and lets hanna know that he used to work for hustlers who stole cars as a way of life he used to be their hacker tapping into computer records for phone numbers and other information he pulled out afraid of the prospect of getting arrested knowing that it was only a matter of time his employers were angered but couldnt deal with caleb as he ran away first hanna is touched that caleb has made another confession to her a secret that he has never told anyone else after caleb leaves hanna revels in the fact that caleb has entrusted her with his deep dark secret she tells emily that caleb has confided something in her that he has never told anyone else but emily is content with listening to hanna without knowing the actual details of the case she has no desire for more secrets after all but that wish is not to be honored suddenly the two girls hear the door open along with whispering at the bottom of the stairs they peep their heads out to look  and spy ashley and tom giggling before kissing the two make their way up the stairs and emily and hanna duck their heads back in before hannas parents realize that they were being watched ashley warns tom to tiptoe and lower his voice so that they can make it upstairs undetected—towards ashleys bedroomlater that night aria and hanna talk with spencer in her car in front of emilys house and then emily joins them suddenly garrett parks in front of the cavanaugh house which is across the street from his parents house he could go either way but he chooses jennas house toby is out on an errand picking up his parents from the airport the girls trod closer to take a better look when the light flicks on revealing jenna who slowly strips to reveal the same black negligee the girls had seen her trying on in the store garrett nears her starts to caress her shoulders then starts kissing her slowly and jenna kisses him back the next morning hanna enters the kitchen to find emily doing situps they both reveal that they havent slept since seeing what they saw emily then joins hanna for breakfast not in the best of moods her muscles are still sore so she has hanna pass her the medical cream that she bought the day before apparently shes used half the tube in less than 24 hours hanna thinks emily is being way too intense for a swim meet emily explains that she is concerned about the danby scout who is supposed to be speculating her meet today she hopes she can make the danby lie less untrue just then tom enters and hanna plays dumb putting on a surprise face he starts making excuses but hanna makes a yeah right face then ashley enters expressing her surprise at seeing tom awake she then catches sight of a pile of mail and asks about it emily says it was on the doormat when she came back last night ashley hands hanna an envelope addressed to her and hanna reluctantly admits to her mother that it is from isabel she pointedly uses it as a coaster for her coffee instead of opening it but ashley wants to know what her competition is writing her daughter and tears the envelope to expose tom and isabels  save the date  curtly she informs tom that he is getting married in six weeks its all awkward turtles after that on their way into school emily and hanna discuss emilys upcoming meet they then catch sight of caleb conducting another shady business deal in the front yard of the school hanna walks towards him and on her way sees a man in a black sports car writing on a file with glossy pictures of caleb attached to it was that who was watching them the previous week alarmed hanna tries to discreetly warn caleb by suggesting conducting business out in the wide open may not be the best idea but he rebuts her idea refusing to work in a lowly parttime job at a fastfood establishment she sighs as the stubborn boy walks away and the car speeds off spencer and hanna visit the hospital to see emily the latter of whom is none too happy to be back in rosewood community so soon she dismisses a call from caleb making spencer raise an eyebrow hanna confesses her fear that an undercover cop is following her boyfriend spencer expects her best friend to say that she alerted her boyfriend to this fact but she doesnt and spencer is shocked she makes a strong argument for when she warns that hanna could lose him either way then hanna rides by in her car and grabs caleb off the sidewalk while dressed as 1930s movie starlet with headscarf and glamorous sunglasses she drives away from the man in the black sports car who gets out of the car to take a better look as she speeds off hanna takes caleb to spencers familys log cabin where they crash to avoid the man following him they light a fire and remove the furniture slips to cozy up caleb says that he wont hide from him while hanna is worried that he is going to skip town but caleb insists that he is staying in rosewood they make out at the marins ashley cleans out the fridge of all the food items she bought her father hanna reveals that she knows everything about her fathers past romance so she can openly argue with her mother to give her father another chance but ashley insists that it is the right thing tom is about to marry isabel and now he is sleeping with another woman she feels like their situations have been completely reversed frustrated with her mothers conclusion hanna leaves hanna goes to the black stake out sports car to let stalker driver know that there are people in town who love caleb and will protect him she tells him to get lost and leave her boyfriend alone the next day at the morgue emily and hanna don the familiar candystriper outfits while keeping watch for spencer who is inside hoping to find the missing page of alison’s coroner’s report spencer returns emptyhanded the page is still gone and she even tried the computer system but it is password protected her suspicions of jason are worsened just then the elevator door opens to reveal jenna being led by a nurse she comments about how she can’t wait to remove some bandages and go to cape may where she hopes to see the ocean again the girls stare after smiling jenna who hasn’t made note of the silent by standing girls at school hanna plops her tray down next to the other pretty little liars  not far from where jenna is sitting spencer fills the girls in on what toby has let her in on since their discovery at the hospital  that jenna is a candidate for prosthetic cornea transplant which means there is a hope that she will see again that night hanna catches sight of the guy staking out caleb talking to him it turns out that the man is a private investigator hired by caleb’s biological mother to track him down hanna and caleb check out caleb’s mother’s claudia dawson online profile they learn that she has two children james and clay and lives in a very upscale neighborhood in california called montecito caleb is vague about whether he plans to call her and leaves to pick up pizza instead of stay and chat at the playground hanna locates caleb who has failed to deliver the pizza hours ago he finally opens up to hanna about his feelings hanna wisely suggests that he at least call his mother in order to find out what happened he can always decide never to call her again or he can start a relationship with her he’s wanted to find out this information for the past twelve years at night caleb enters the marin’s foyer to fill hanna in on the conversation he just had with his mother he shares with her how his mother said that his voice sounds like his father’s and how she invited him to california for a reunion hanna is taking everything in when caleb reveals that he is planning to fly to california that night after waiting twelve years he doesn’t want to wait a moment longer hanna feels dejected that caleb will be leaving but is overall happy for him they will be conducting a long distance relationship until he returns which date is unsettled they share kisses and i love yous before caleb leaves rosewood to head for the airport hanna closes the door and starts to cry over losing caleb for the second time with caleb’s complicated family relationship in view hanna has new perspective on her own family matters she finally picks up the phone to call her father and agree to partake in his wedding plans the next day ashley is in the kitchen when hanna comes down for breakfast emily had left earlier that morning apparently to watch swim practice but not participate the two comment on how highstrung shes been so ashley digs up a gift certificate for a free massage for hanna to give to emily hanna expresses benign jealousy but agrees with her mother that emily needs it ashley also finds a letter from tom expressing his appreciation of hanna agreeing to attend his wedding hanna shrugs it off but ashley assures her that she will happy if hanna is happy for her father ashley then realizes that hanna is late for school but hanna explains she isnt going as the college fair is that day and attendance is optional ashley gives hanna a look and hanna promises to go but whether she means it is up for interpretation hanna and emily pass through the hallways to emilys locker hanna gives her the body massage certificate before leaving school to join mona in trying on her bridesmaid dress at the bridal shop hanna tries on a brown gown and mona expresses her contempt for the garment hanna is annoyed but intent on giving isabel a chance mona calls her and her daughter hillbillies just then kate walks in with a matching brown gown but mona changes her tune about kate when she sees how stylishly she is dressed hanna makes a joke and kate gives a half laugh she then invites them along for lunch with her older cousins and mona accepts while hanna refuses kate only seems to pick up on monas response though and the three make plans for later hanna fumes but mona points out that hanna did say she wanted to give her future step family a chance silencing hanna so they go to the west maple riding club where riding horses are being led apparently monas and hannas lunch plans fell through once mona had falsely mentioned that she had attended equestrian camp kate had invited them to go riding and the two are now standing suited in riding gear kate and two of her friends arrive leading horses she asks hanna and mona to pass her friends their helmets which read  elizabeth  and  margaux  the former goes by bitsy and hanna cluelessly pronounces the x at the end of the latters name while mona flashes her language skills conversing momentarily with margaux in french hanna reveals more ignorance when kate asks her a question and mona saves the day laughing as if hanna intended her words as a joke they all mount their horses and only hanna struggles kate piteously asks if hanna would like to turn back but mona quickly assures her that they will be fine and that she will help hanna learn the ropes she suggests that the other three head out first while they trail behind next mona and hanna are walking through some random woods their faces stained with dirt apparently hannas horse bit her ankle and the girls managed to lose kates horses hanna gets mona to admit that summer spent at equestrian camp never happened hanna snaps at mona accusing her of befriending kate for selfish reasons and mona counters that hanna has been badtempered ever since caleb left mona and hanna finally get a chance to sit down hanna apologizes to mona for snapping earlier and expresses her frustration with having tried hard to make a good impression and befriend kate and her friends mona tries to comfort her but hanna rails on about how she felt that kate and her friends were giving her dirty looks and assuming she was clueless when mona suggests that hanna hadnt tried hard enough she recoils calling isabel isahell the skank and kate and her friends bitches who can go to hell suddenly mona catches the sound of a gasp and realizes that everything hanna is saying is being amplified over a loud speaker attached to the building they are in mona alerts hanna to whats happened and picks up her riding hat which had clearly tripped the microphone switch when she set it down moments before hanna rushes outside to apologize but kate walks off miffed her lackeys at her heels at home hanna grabs for a chocolate pudding ashley steps in and hanna nervously asks her if tom called ashley answers no and asks how the college fair was hanna reveals that she left school early to try on a dress but only reveals that it wasnt a great fit not disclosing the rest of the days failed events suddenly the phone rings and tom tells ashley something that hanna cannot hear which makes ashley respond no i didnt know that hanna thinks shes in trouble but is surprised when ashley chirpily hands her the phone telling her it is from kate out of her mothers earshot hanna begins by thanking kate but the latter turns sinister and creepily warns hanna that she will break her like a horse the next day early in the morning emily leaves hannas room to get into her car and leave waking hanna when hanna calls emily she discovers em left her phone in her bag the liars gather in hannas room and discuss where emily could have gone looking through emilys phone spencer finds a picture of ezra and aria kissing sent by a along with the caption clue ella in and ill let you out emily goes to dr sullivans office and surprisingly the three other liars are there waiting for her as the girls talk about how they are being threatened dr sullivan cant help but ask who is threatening them the liars decide to tell her about a emily tells dr sullivan that the threats began even before alison’s funeral at first they thought it was alison but then they found her body they also mention that a is an expert at making other people look guilty they have clues about who heshethey might be but they’ve been wrong before dr sullivan in turn is astounded that the girls have not told anybody else about a and that she is only person they have ever told at school the liars debate whether or not they should have mentioned jenna in their talk with dr sullivan hanna then changes the subject by asking spencer if shes brought the horse books hanna is gifting these to her new stepsister kate aria finds it weird that hanna is being so nice to her mean stepsister but hanna insists shes doing this for her dad the topic shifts back to jenna when the liars see her talking on the phone emily thinks it was jenna who sent the ezria picture just then hannas grandma comes over and says hello to the girls shes in town early for the rehearsal dinner the next night at the marins hanna flirts with caleb on the phone who seems to be enjoying california and his new family hanna gets off the phone to face regina who bluntly tells hanna that she disapproves of tom marrying isabel then ashley enters and to her annoyance realizes that regina is rearranging the kitchen unabashed regina boldly tells ashley that she should try to win tom back as isabel is not the one for him ashely brushes off her request and tries to convince her to revert the kitchen to its earlier state which she does not in a school assembly dr sullivan makes a speech that addresses technology’s role in school bullying the school bullies behave typically with bored and snide expressions on their faces the girls wear uncomfortable expressions as dr sullivan encourages the students being bullied to speak out if they dont feel safe mona files her nails and jenna looks snide right after the assembly the girls congregate outside the building discussing their feelings of vulnerability hanna questions whether confiding in dr sullivan was a good idea in the first place just then jenna walks over and reminds the girls that alison could have benefited from such an assembly she looks smug and emily rebuts her by calling jenna a bully and asking her to move her stick whos the bully now at the dinner toast for tom’s wedding hanna makes one last effort to bond with her stepsister kate at first kate follows hannas suit when she apologizes for her earlier behavior and claims that she didnt mean her threats in their last phone conversation chipper kate offers hanna some vodka disguised in water bottles from her purse hanna accepts none too thrilled to be asked to make a speech hanna is getting drunker by the minute while kate pens cheesy words for a toast she notices hanna checking out the picture of caleb on her phone and declares him cute after hanna shows her the screen suddenly kates uncle roy passes by and kate becomes agitated not wanting him to see them she asks hanna to drink up quickly the two sip from their drinks as he passes and makes no notice of them but kate doesnt explain her strange behavior and instead asks a waiter for more drinks before they enter the dining room kate leads hanna into the bridal suite rather than the dining room where they have yet to make their joint speech by now hanna is totally wasted and plops down on the bed however kate is somehow mostly or completely in control of her senses and carries her mothers wedding dress into the room she brings the dress to hannas attention once more parading it in front of her and commenting on how beautiful it looks hanna agrees but is more interested in getting something to eat kate leaves to get such a thing and hanna suddenly obeys her urge to play with isabels gown for the next night she holds it to her body and spins around the room with it but the motion makes her dizzy and she collapses on the bed before vomiting on the dress while she is throwing up kate returns with a plate of food when she sees what hanna is doing she smirks and turns back around hanna tries against all odds to rid the wedding dress of her vomit stains but she is busted when tom enters the ladies room having heard that hanna is ill luckily hanna’s grandmother is there to support hanna realizing what hanna has done he becomes livid with her he accuses her of trying to sabotage his wedding and ignores her defense that kate had been drinking as well he simultaneously ejects his mother and daughter from the party and leaves the room in a huff grandma marin helps hanna recover with some tea the dress seems hopeless kate enters and offers hanna some ginger ale under the guise of being sympathetic regina grabs her purse and reveals that kate had water bottles full of vodka for hanna and unspiked water bottles for herself exposing kate for tripping hanna and trying to win over her in the eyes of tom angry hanna vows her revenge but kate just shrugs and leaves emily texts hanna and the others to meet dr sullivan at her office she claims to know as identity however when the girls arrive the office is empty they receive a message from a stating the doctor is out the next day the liars are seen ringing the doorbell on dr sullivans home dr sullivan isn’t there and hasn’t picked up the latest copies of the rosewood observer from off her stoop her voicemail says she’s been called out of town on a family emergency spencer reminds them that the last time somebody thought she knew who a was she got hit by a car they also agree going to the police will not help as garrett jenna ian and jason all seem to be linked to the rosewood police department  later spencer calls the liars to come over to look at a huge box that was mysteriously delivered to her house bearing the inscription open or she dies trepidly the girls remove the lid to find a list of ransom demands the instructions are made of letters cut out from magazines beneath the letter are three creepy talking dolls with pullstrings resembling spencer hanna and aria hanna’s blonde lookalike says stop the wedding emily is disconcerted that there is no doll for her the others speculate that it’s because she’s been a target for weeks but emily is slow to believe that the seemingly omniscient a would make such an oversight spencer realizes that a is being their ultimate frenemy by pushing them to do things they want anyway knowing that all hell will break loose when they do it’s 2 pm they now have 5 hours remaining spencer remembers that there was no hesitation when a pushed ian off the belltower fully believing a to be capable of murder emily and hanna dress for the upcoming wedding hanna expresses her fears of losing her dad who was gone for the past two years if she screws up the wedding he’ll surely leave again tom knocks on the door and emily leaves to give them privacy dad and daughter both say sorry about the vomit on isabels dress incident hanna tries to dissuade her father one last time asking him whether he truly loves isabel tom is firm that his fling with ashley was only in order to evade a commitment that deep down he wants to make and that isabel makes him happy as the wedding begins the girls are worried that emily has not yet arrived hanna with caleb at the wedding mopes that her father and projected stepmother really do look happy together kate comes over to taunt hanna and hanna makes a pretext of her phone beeping to hurriedly leave the text message hanna has received is from a warning her that dr sullivan is about to suffocate as the officiating minister preaches hanna shockingly interrupts the ceremony to ask for a private word with isabel tom tries to see if it can wait but hanna insists so isabel complies and leads hanna to the rectory meanwhile spencer and aria realize that hanna will need backup and so leave the church to get their car a move not unnoticed by caleb alone with isabel hanna spills that tom hooked up with ashley when he returned to rosewood isabel asks whether this is true and hanna turns around to see that her father has been observing their conversation when he doesnt deny it isabel sets down her bouquet and walks off hanna mumbles an apology but there is little time to process as a directs the girls to the barn on grover road where emily is at the barn the girls make sense of the clues as left for them suddenly emily sees a rusty curved shovel perched on the barn door and affirms that the shovel must have been placed there recently spencer picks it up to see a note taped to the inside of the shovel with latitude and longitude coordinates hanna remembers that her text during the ceremony read that dr sullivan was about to run out of air did a bury dr sullivan alive in their heels they stumble towards the undisclosed location in the middle of some woods but there is nothing then a clearing the girls then catch sight of a stick protruding from a spot in the ground hanna notices it and gets texted prompting hanna to say she’s still alive and that they should start digging first they find her boots and eventually a face that belongs to a mannequin then a helicopter roars overheard and the girls realize that they have been set up spencer hanna and aria are seated in an isolated investigation room the girls are numb and silent their nice dresses are covered in dirt stains and their whole bodies are smudged with dirt unbeknownst to them they are being watched by officer garrett and detective wilden on the other side of the mirror garrett is eager to convict the girls of their supposed guilt darren then walks into the room shocking the girls with his presence he accuses the girls of having committed homicide detective wilden confronts the girls saying he’s given them so many chances to be honest with them and evidence doesn’t lie he asserts that he has caught the girls with the murder weapon which the police have known about all along he puts the nowbagged shovel from the barn on the table in october 2008 alison is narrating a scary story to a frightened kid that hanna is babysitting it’s about two blonde twins who are shown on screen after getting into a fight over a doll one of them gets mad and stabs the other in the heart with a knife on halloween hanna thinks alison should stop but the child is riveted so alison continues on about how the murderess little girl went to the asylum—“until yesterday” and vows to kill every kid who goes trickortreating alison then maniacally stabs the butchers knife she is holding deep into the pumpkin they are carving on the table the girls walk to school debating halloween costumes—should hanna go as bald britney alison is bossy with regards to hannas decision and makes a jab about hannas weight noel drives up in a convertible with his jock friends to greet the liars and especially alison spying aria he says come prepared to be scared exciting her with the knowledge that they are invited to noels bash as noel drives away alison mocks the other liars for being so excited to attend a party they continue walking and pass a rundown abandoned house a figure is seen in one of the upstairs windows and emily calls it out frightening the other girls aria comments that she gets a bad feeling from this place feeling as if something bad had happened there spencer attributes the movement to typical rosewood kid activity on halloween and alison is equally nonchalant in her bedroom that night pajamaclad hanna watches a scary movie beside a huge bowl of popcorn the phone rings just as a voice on the film says not to answer the phone hanna reluctantly picks up but nobody responds next the power goes off then on making the lights flicker momentarily and the phone rings again hanna picks up and this time it’s alison asking if she was at the costume shop and had sent her a text when hanna responds in the negative alison doesnt bother to explain her questioning and hangs up just then there is a knock at the door—but it’s not the bogeyman exactly but policeman darren driving a drunken ashley home apparently ashley had binged on martinis at the grille it is revealed that ashley is upset about her husband leaving and is stressed about dealing with the situation he has left behind in rosewood as ashley falls asleep on the couch hanna consoles her that her dad’s new girlfriend is pretty ugly the next day hanna enters the kitchen as her mother sits reading the newspaper on the counter she is looking through the job listings glum at having found little better than maid openings when she spots an opening for a bank branch manager in rosewood she pauses considering suddenly darren comes by to check on ashley ashley takes him aside not wanting hanna to hear darren makes implied advances but ashley lets him down calling his expectations a misunderstanding he ominously warns her to be careful out there when ashley returns inside hanna questions the behavior “that was a horny cop” ashley replies writing it away firmly that night the girls get dressed in spencer’s bedroom hanna is donning her britney costume emily is dressed as a native american and spencer is wearing a corset dress alison is dressed as lady gaga suddenly someone dressed in a burlap cowl with a doll mask is seen outside the window spencer notices himher and the girls all squeal with worry the doorbell then rings presumably for a pizza delivery but spencer insists on going downstairs in company at the halloween party noel dressed as a gynecologist approaches to greet them correctly characterizing ali as lady ga ga or hot chick emily as a native american hanna as cute britney and aria as a witch only spencer as mary queen of scots he cant place hanna and aria go in search of the bathroom they follow the arrow on the sign at the edge of some woods that reads killer drinks this way as they move deeper into the bushes they are scared by someone in a scary costume who creeps up on them some time later emily is sitting outside alone hanna joins her wondering where alison is the other liars join up and they get a text that reads i’m in trouble come alone from ali directing them to the scary houses address so they all hurry over there it’s abandoned except for torn lace curtains and antique dolls in a corresponding dollhouse they are startled to see a lonely suit hanging in the middle of a room giving the appearance of someone being hanged with the shadow it casts they find ali in a locked room seemingly terrified she recounts that someone grabbed her and brought her there threatening to kill her with a knife nobody can get a signal to dial 911 from their cell phones so ali goes out alone then she screams but the door is now bolted and they can’t open it through the keyhole they see a big fight with her and costumed guy with a knife ali knees him and runs off and the liars get out through a conveniently open window they go back in the house and ali is rocking in a chair brandishing a knife and looking completely insane but she says it was all a hoax noel was the zombie the blood was ketchup which she meanly offers to a tearing hanna and they passed the test spencer is the only who can voice her betrayed feelings at alisons dumb joke but she unabashedly counters that she now knows that she can count on them as her friends when she needs them they all look really annoyed and betrayed by alisons crying wolf but are silent back at the party noel approaches ali to apologize but she tells him it was perfect—but then realizes he’s apologizing because he didn’t make it to the plot he was stuck at the party not because he had been too rough with her now alison is taken aback who was it then back in real time a month has passed since the night of their arrest the four girls are picking up trash for community service on the rosewood camp grounds two strangers also doing time make snarky comments in front of the girls about them and when one says they killed someone emily snaps at her by saying they didnt do anything spencer tells emily to stop talking to them emily tells the other girls that spencers mom would sell them out in a second to save spencer and that they should consider making a deal with a a fight ensues hanna and the guards break it up earning both spencer and emily two extra weeks of community service the next morning hanna talks to ashley in the kitchen she asks why hanna ruined her fathers wedding she said it had to be done and regrets they wound up at a justice of the peace to get married anyway hanna leaves the room when emily enters after class aria walks down the hall with hanna recounting the awkward morning with ezra and wishing she could have explained why she had to break up with him hanna reminds her she had no choice emily passes by and they both give her the cold shoulder it appears hanna and aria are closer than ever while emily is being outed outside lucas tells hanna he found another photo of her doing community service on the internet she debates whether she wants to see it then decides she does lucas minimizes the site he was looking at to show her the photo and insists she looks pretty in it caleb returns and hanna is very happy to see him they kiss in her foyer while lucas looks on awkwardly that night all 4 girls meet at the greenhouse emily shows them the text she got from a earlier it becomes clear that all the fighting and sniping earlier had been for show spencer revels in the knowledge that she rattled garretts cage they openly discuss the details of their plan to trap a emily will go to the greenhouse with the box of evidence while spencer aria and hanna hide outside and come to aid her when the time is right aria arrives late to the swim meet apologizing to spencer saying its complicated she made it just in the nick of time to put their plan into action emily exits the gym after the swim meet spots the girls and demands the box jason gave aria for all to hear she declares she knows where spencer hid the box and storms off the other girls feign annoyance with caleb lucas toby garrett and other students looking on that night ashley prevents hanna from leaving the house by telling her tom is coming over to talk hanna learns that her dad stepmom and stepsister kate will be moving to rosewood and doesnt hide her displeasure tom doesnt hide his frustration with hanna either so ashley steps in to remind them he is moving to rosewood to be close with his daughter because he loves her hanna arrives at the greenhouse just in time to see a running away and accidentally hits himher with her car a however shows to suffer no major damage and continues to run through the woods losing the girls spencer shouts that now they have nothing frustrated they return to greenhouse and discover as phone on the ground under hannas front headlight they all stare at it thinking the same thing  they may have actually found hard evidence to expose the identity of a they head back into the greenhouse to look for the box and decide what to do next they have a contest over who has had the worse day spencer suggests calling caleb to help them recover information from the phone but hanna doesnt want to get him involved the phone rings caller unknown each girl is afraid to answer it they never get the chance because more glass comes crashing down from the ceiling they drive away heading straight to caleb against hannas wishes caleb hooks the phone up to his laptop and explains the recovery process while downloading the information the owner of the phone shuts it down remotely caleb agrees to try to unlock the files they do have if hanna is okay with it she reluctantly agrees caleb works on decrypting the files on his laptop at school hanna is concerned someone may figure out what hes doing but he assures her he hasnt told anyone he tries to get her to tell him what it is all about hanna calls out lucas name as he walks by and makes plans for a study session later on even though lucas doesnt seem to have time for it hanna is unhappy with spencer at the moment for dragging caleb into their a investigation emily suggests spencer let hanna use her lake house for face time with caleb she accidentally lets slip that hanna has used it for that purpose before which comes as news to spencer at hannas house hanna tries to study while lucas seems distracted she gets a text from spencer offering her the lake house she gets the brilliant idea to use it to throw caleb a surprise birthday party and enlists lucas help in planning it lucas says he cannot contribute financially but reluctantly agrees to help the next day at school mona flags down hanna in the hall to ask where her invitation is hanna didnt think mona and by extension noel would want to attend a surprise party for caleb but mona assures her all is forgiven between them they would love to attend a cool party at spencers lake house caleb beckons them into a nearby classroom to show them what he recovered from the mystery phone it is a photo of 4 porcelain dolls sitting in a row on a wooden surface in front of green floral wallpaper the girls pretend like the photo means nothing to them they thank caleb for his help and exit hanna stays behind trying to make a plan for calebs birthday takeout perhaps so he doesnt suspect a surprise party he worries that her keeping the information surrounding this phone a secret could be a problem for their relationship she assures him it is not important and they kiss in the neighborhood to pick up a cake hanna pops in on ezra in his office to let him know she and arias other friends approve of their relationship at the party which seems well underway hanna is distracted by all her partyplanning responsibilities mona and noel inform her the pizzas she ordered all came with green peppers then noel leaves offering to help hang the birthday banner hanna is clearly stressed out and refuses to listen to anything spencer has to say then hanna takes the rowboat out with lucas to set up the fireworks across the lake halfway across the lake lucas stops rowing she becomes more and more frightened by lucas tone and asks to go back hearing spencer calling her name from shore lucas stands and shouts at her hanna flips pushes him overboard and takes the oars she doesnt get far before a hand latches onto one of the oars and hanna herself falls overboard after a few tense moments hanna swims to shore spencer tries to warm hanna up and find out what happened mona and noel appear halfdressed and dripping because they just took a dip caleb arrives and hanna meekly mumbles surprise next the four girls are sitting in spencers house warming hanna up by the fire she is certain that lucas is still alive and out there though the other girls say he never came back up to shore hanna is about to take a drink of water when the other girls notice its lake water and stop her an accompanying text from a is sent seconds after hanna drinks a little bit of the lake water mrs marin has a lot of questions for emily and hanna the next morning ashley is concerned and feels partially responsible for lucas not coming home last night hanna informs her that lucas called his parents earlier ashley tries to comfort hanna saying lucas will talk to her when he is ready they leave to go to spencers claiming they need to run a group presentation once more spencer has found cell phones and an old receipt up in her attic at the lake house certain that a was up there the date on the receipt is from around the time that hanna and caleb went up to the lake house the receipt lists an address in philadelphia aria and spencer agree to check out the place in philly later this afternoon at school mona confesses to hanna how she thinks she is losing noel after calebs party but hanna lost in thought doesnt really listen and only snaps to full attention when she sees a guy taking down her homecoming picture stating that the administration doesnt think that tiaras and orange jumpsuits are a good mix mona snaps that she is not giving up the crown then returns to discussing her problems she asks if shes being paranoid and finds out that hanna wasnt listening hanna explains she has her own problems to deal with but since she cant explain those problems to mona mona thinks she is just being selfish hanna goes into the girls room locks herself in a stall and starts crying hanna still crying in the bathroom suddenly notices that water is flowing into her stall she walks out to discover an overflowing sink with a small wooden boat floating in the sink a of course texts hanna life is but a dream hanna and im your worst nightmare a hanna and caleb are in hannas kitchen caleb wants to go look for lucas knowing he isnt at his cousins house like he told his parents hanna says hell come home when hes ready and caleb catches on that maybe she doesnt want to find him this causes a fight between the two and she says that he can look for lucas and no one is stopping him he leaves then mona texts hanna saying she needs to talk hanna ignores it and continues to mope in the evening hanna calls caleb a few times concerned about his safety and whereabouts she notices the wind blew the door open and thinks the latch is broken when she goes into her bedroom lucas surprises her there claiming that he never wanted to hurt her hanna asks what he did to caleb while covertly calling caleb on her cell caleb who is already downstairs gets the call and rushes up to hannas room hearing lucas threatening voice in the background caleb asks what lucas did and where he has been lucas reveals why he was mia he lost 4000 in a bet over a basketball game money which belonged to caleb it was a sure thing until the team got disqualified after the rowboat incident he drove all over selling his comic books to try to get some of calebs money back now theyre all on good terms again but hanna now is unsure of who they met in the greenhouse the girls ponder this new information over unopened chinese food spencer shows them the signin book from the rehab center they learn that garrett visited jenna there for 20 minutes then signed her out they could both have been in rosewood at the time of alisons murder they open the food and to their horror find it was replaced with live earthworms a sends a text about this being what live bait looks like the next day the girls are checking out what caleb got from as cell phone they see the video of ali and ian at the kissing rock and wonder if this is all there is hanna hopes it is so caleb doesnt have to be involved anymore then a new video starts ian hides a video camera on a shelf in alis bedroom and then garrett and jenna enter the room ian called them to help search for the n a t club videos that ali wont hand over garrett accuses ian of going too far which is why he bailed on the club in the first place they start searching alis bedroom for the videos at ians request garrett finds something weird in a wooden box then the video cuts off the girls are left wondering if those missing videos are what got ali killed the secret compartment inside the doll in alis box pops open while hanna holds the doll they find a series of threatening notes the one about a pumpkin catches their attention the girls flash back to walking home the night of noels halloween party the jackolanterns on her porch are destroyed a carving knife stabs through a note into one of the pumpkins alison laughs it off as the work of jasons beer buddies she apologizes for the prank she pulled earlier then asks the girls to stay over in the present day they realize the note that alison got actually said next time itll be your face and it was signed by a hanna tries to console mona over her breakup with noel but mona is still upset with hanna mona grabs a necklace out of her locker and tries to return it to noel who is standing nearby with his friends he promptly dumps it in the trash and laughs when mona begins to cry hanna follows a tearful mona into the bathroom and tries to comfort her though she cant seem to find the right words they agree to use their fake ids at rive gauche later that night caleb confronts hanna in her kitchen about the cell phone having something to do with alisons murder hanna doesnt want him working on the videos at all because it is too dangerous caleb tells her garrett has been watching him that is the last straw for hanna she thrusts the memory card from as phone into the blender and holds the lid down while it spins and breaks into pieces at night ashley spots the blender in the trash and questions hanna about it hanna asks her if she ever kept a secret from her father while they were together ashley recounts a few stories from the past then asks what hanna is keeping from caleb but hanna isnt talking hanna and mona spot jenna and noel sitting together in rive gauche  one night hanna calls caleb aria and emily but all of them decline eventually spencer answers her phone and says she is with her family however hanna hears someone break a glass and aria shout out emilys name in surprise making her realize that the girls are together hanna is hurt thinking the girls are mad at her for destroying the flash drive but doesnt force the subject in the marins kitchen hanna and ashley eat dinner in silence when ashley asks about the elephant in the room hanna says that kate isnt an elephant but a snake who is going to ruin her life ashley assures her that tom made it clear to kate that if there was any problem between her and hanna there would be consequences hanna isnt convinced kate will listen but ashley gets her to promise that she will do everything she can to make kate feel welcome in rosewood at school the next day hanna asks the girls what they did the previous night and they lie that they were studying its kates first day at rosewood high and a worried hanna keeps looking around for her as they walk back to their table kate approaches them looking a little nervous and awkwardly makes conversation with the girls spencer asks kate if they have met before kate says it was at the wedding but spencer thinks it was somewhere else hanna shows kate to her next class and gets a text from a who warns her to keep caleb out of their business or they will expose ashleys theft of the money from the bank hanna later joins the others and asks them if they know anything about caleb still investigating the files from as phone the girls brush it off and quickly leave but hanna confronts spencer saying that she knows they are annoyed she destroyed the memory drive but they shouldnt just push her away as she was only doing it to protect caleb and would do the same for anyone of them the girls are eating lunch with kate who is being disturbingly nice spencer asks kate if she has ever been to maine along with many other questions trying to figure out where they had met clearly making kate uncomfortable when kate leaves to meet her teachers hanna tells spencer to back off because kate might tell her dad her friends are grilling her spencer insists she knows kate from somewhere but doesnt know from where hanna and spencer hang out in spencers house preparing to watch a movie hanna is still worried about kate sure that her nice personality is just an act to convince hanna that she has nothing to worry about spencer shows hanna the photo of kate from camp covered in bug bites however hannas good mood suddenly shifts when she finds a picture of alis fake id on spencers phone spencer confesses that caleb is still working on the information from as phone and they kept it a secret from her hanna is furious she says that while she was worried about kate backstabbing her she didnt realize spencer was the one holding the knife and storms out hanna waits for caleb outside her house she confronts him about going behind her back he says that he knows she is trying to protect him but he is worried about her hanna says he isnt the only one she is trying to protect and tells him the last year was really hard on her and ashley she confesses that they had serious money issues and almost lost their house and ashley stole money from the bank to support them hanna says she never told anyone that before and caleb thanks hanna for trusting him hanna says someone else knows and is holding it over her caleb asks if its jenna but hanna says she doesnt know and that it is this unknown persons phone that caleb is working on spencer comes to hannas to apologize and says that going behind her back wasnt an act of betrayal it was desperation a has taken everything from her and she cant lose hanna too hanna hugs spencer and says that she hasnt lost her in hannas room hanna says that she has seen ali with dark hair before flashback to a chubby hanna entering a hair salon and being sat next to a darkhaired girl named vivian darkbloom hanna recognizes alis voice and is surprised to see that vivian is actually alison ali says she is pretending to be someone else and asks hanna to play along when hanna asks why ali says she does it all the time because she is bored and suggests hanna do the same sometime ali hints she gets sick of being herself sometimes and pulls off the wig spencer does an internet search for vivian darkbloom which she finds to be an anagram of vladimir nabokov the russian author who wrote lolita hanna realizes she still has alis copy of that book and grabs it off the shelf spencer finds a claim ticket inside at school the next day noel approaches hanna and thanks her for making his day hanna is confused but noel just grins and walks away emily spencer and aria come up to hanna shocked that she would do such a thing asking for an explanation hanna asks what she did and emily shows hanna her phone which displays a picture of kate naked in the girls locker room hanna is horrified and insists she didnt send it to them but aria says she didnt just send it to them she sent it to her entire contact list as they look around everybody stares at hanna disgusted by what she has done the girls dont need to guess who the real culprit is hanna ashley isabel and kate sit outside the vice principals office in silence hannas phone rings but ashley glares at her when she goes to answer it eventually vice principal tamborelli calls in mrs marin and both isabel and ashley respond back in tamborellis office isabel is furious about the situation and implies that ashley is a bad mother and that hanna has it out for kate ashley defends hanna while isabel demands that hanna be punished tamborelli assures them that hanna will not be let off the hook and under any other circumstances hanna would be expelled but due to the unusual situation he insists they attend the rosewood high truth up day a guided workshop where students can own up to bad behavior and build barriers until the school board decide what to do ashley volunteers to supervise the girls stand by hannas locker discussing the situation a got hanna into spencer says at least hanna wasnt suspended and eventually it will all blow over but hanna isnt convinced a wont get hungry and lash out again annoyed she points out how they thought they had all the power because they had as phone but now a is using their own phones against them hanna walks down the hall and is met with glares from the other students she sees kate and isabel talking with tamborelli and quickly turns around in her bedroom hanna is looking at the picture of kate when ashley comes in hanna says she doesnt have to go to truth up day but ashley says she wants some answers for herself she sits beside hanna on her bed and says she loves her very much and will crush anyone who tries to hurt her hanna doesnt want to talk about it but ashley says it isnt the first time hanna said someone framed her and wants to know who it is asking for a name but hanna says there is no name ashley asks hanna if she sent the picture of kate and crying hanna finally says she did not during truth up day hanna kate and noel participate in an activity where they make suggestions on how to improve the school noel suggests hot tubs and kate simply says she wants to go back to her old school ella intervenes asking for reasonable suggestions she asks kate what her old school has that rosewood doesnt and kate simply says nice people ella asks what else and kate says that students should have their own say and if someone has messed with them they should get to choose how to punish them which noel agrees to he says that if someone messed with him he would want payback and explains how bad boys have nothing on mean girls as a guy throws a few punches whereas girls gang up on one another and dont fight fair while glaring at hanna hanna snaps back saying noel is the worst person in rosewood and when ella tries to intervene hanna asks if she really thinks she is as bad as noel described is she really a bully when ella doesnt respond hanna storms off caleb and hanna sit together on the roof of the school he asks why she is upset and hanna says that her mom thinks that she sent the picture caleb doesnt believe it but hanna points out that only four people know the truth and suggests that they run away to california hanna is startled by a noise behind them but caleb says it is just the plastic sheets moving in the wind and that no one ever comes up there he says he wants to help her by tracing the ip address of the person who sent the photo hanna wants to him to forget about that and asks him to just hold her then they kiss in the hall aria hanna and emily are sitting together eating dinner when they notice kate nearby aria suggests they move somewhere else but hanna says she is fine as kate pulls off her sweater hanna notices a birthmark on kates waist realizing something she looks at the picture of kate on emilys phone and sees that the birthmark isnt in the photo which could mean it was photoshopped aria asks why a would go through so much trouble to do that and improve kates image when they were trying to embarrass her and hanna says that maybe a didnt send the text hanna leads kate into the girls bathroom and confronts her about the picture saying she didnt take the picture but she knows who did kate insists she doesnt know what hanna is talking about and hanna says that there was no birthmark in the photo and that kate should be more careful when taking a sweater off in public kate yells at hanna saying that she had no choice as she knew spencer would download the hideous pictures of her at riding camp hanna asks aria if she can borrow her phone and aria and emily emerge from the bathroom stalls having recorded the conversation and kates confession aria emily and hanna exit the bathroom and aria notes how genius kates plan was hanna asks them to get caleb to keep out of their business with a hanna goes to find ashley while aria looks for caleb later kate and hanna are seen leaving tamborellis office and hanna hugs ashley while isabel stares at kate in disbelief later that night everyone is asleep in the assembly hall emily wakes up and checks her phone and finds six missed calls from the number aria called she wakes hanna and aria and the person calls them again this time emily speaks a man answers and asks if she is vivians friend and what she wants emily says she has a few questions and the man says he has some of his own but he doesnt want to talk over the phone and asks her to meet him emily looks at the others and agrees the next day at rosewood high caleb is still hacking into as files and hanna asks how he can get online in the school caleb explains he has his own wifi suddenly as they notice garrett along with another police officer enter the school looking around for someone they head towards caleb who immediately locks his computer garrett shows caleb a court order which allows them to confiscate his laptop when caleb asks why garrett explains that someone is hacking into the school files and he traced it back to his ip address caleb almost finds it humorous that they think he would be stupid enough to leave a trail but garrett says that they will find out and a reluctant caleb hands over his laptop garrett asks if there are any passwords they will need but caleb notes that the court order is allowing them to take his laptop and doesnt say anything about what information is in his head when garrett leaves hanna asks caleb what that was about caleb tells her not to worry as there is no way they will be able to get into his computer hanna returns to the girls and tells them what happened when they all receive a text they nervously read it and of course its from the ever so mysterious a now its calebs turn  a caleb and hanna talk in the empty computer room where hanna is freaking out but caleb is calm he assures hanna that he didnt do what they think he did and there is no way they will be able to get past his firewall without his help plus the files from as phone are all on flashdrives backed up online hanna says that someone did get into his laptop and they put the evidence in there somewhere he wouldnt find it and she thinks the person who did that might be garrett caleb asks how she knows that and hanna says she just does and asks caleb if he can go online log into his computer remotely and delete the files caleb says he can do that and logs on to a computer caleb types in his password noting that the initials are the cities he grew up in in the order that he lived there with alternating capital letters he ends it with 1105 which confuses hanna but caleb says its just a good idea to add numbers and punctuation marks however caleb cant connect to his laptop which he says means one of two things either the police havent tried messing with it yet or theyre smart enough to keep it offline later on aria sits in a booth at a diner with alis copy of lolita on the table in front of her and hanna emily and spencer in the booth behind her a man comes over and taps the book noting that aria is a friend of vivians he sits down and asks aria how much vivian owed her to which aria is shocked to hear aria asks what vivian did and he explains that he worked at allegheny cellular in human resources and vivian wanted information aria asks what information vivian wanted and the man says that vivian told him about a friend called alison who was getting texts from somebody but the number was blocked and she wanted to know where they were coming from and would pay to find out aria asks if he found out and he says he did but made the mistake of telling vivian before he had the money in his hand and then he got fired for accessing restricted information aria asks what he knows about the person sending the texts but the man is not talking without the money vivian owes him aria reaches for her purse and asks how much to which he says 2000 and the price could go up he writes down his number and as he gets up to leave aria asks who she should ask for when she calls and he tells her to ask for jonah  after he leaves the four discuss this new information and how if he finds out ali is dead there wont be enough money in the world to make him talk emily says if jonah found out who a was and told ali it must be why she was killed they need to find out what jonah knows but they dont have the money aria asks spencer but her bank account has been on lockdown since she was arrested the following day at school caleb argues with someone on the phone when he hangs up caleb tells hanna that the police will let him have his laptop back if he cooperates hanna asks what he is going to do but caleb shakes his head and leaves at the marin house hanna asks if they could get caleb a lawyer but ashley says they cant help he has his own family hanna says he wont ask them for help and barely even talks to her about it ashley leaves to answer the phone and maya arrives asking emily if they can talk ashley returns to the kitchen and tells hanna theyve been invited to the police station at the police station ashley and hanna meet with wilden who takes the time to mention to ashley that its been a while he explains that he called them in to discuss alisons murder investigation pages of her autopsy have been stolen the police have been looking into it and they found a photo which he hands to ashley who looks at it for a moment and gives it to hanna it shows hanna spencer and emily in the hospital outside the morgue dressed as candystrippers sometime later hanna and ashley are allowed to leave ashley wonders why spencer and emilys parents werent called in as well she pulls hanna aside and says although hanna didnt answer darrens questions she has to answer hers and asks why they were dressed in those outfits hanna quickly lies that she and emily dared spencer to go in the morgue as a joke and insists they had no idea there were files in there ashley says she already told hanna that she knows when she is lying and hanna swears that they didnt take the page from the autopsy ashley stares at her daughter in silence for a moment before leading her out of the building back home hanna talks to caleb on the phone he is at the police station ad plans to cooperate as he doesnt seem to have a choice he quickly tells hanna that he is in a very hot spot and that he needs her help hanging up before he can elaborate hanna is in her bedroom with her laptop open trying to hack into calebs computer to delete the files but she cant remember his password spencer arrives having gotten hannas sos and hanna asks if she knows how to hack into computers which spencer doesnt reminding her that is what caleb is for hanna explains that she needs to get into his computer and delete the incriminating files or he will be arrested spencer tries to help she remembers what caleb told her about his password and manages to remember all the cities hes lived in in their precise order as well as alternating caps she remembers the exclamation point at the end but cant remember the last four numbers hanna and spencer are having little luck with the password having only one more try before the system locks hanna remembers 11something5 but is stumped with the last number spencer asks if it could be a code a date part of a phone number a birthday or an anniversary when something clicks in hannas mind without elaborating hanna types in the last number which turns out to be correct the girls are ecstatic they got in until they realise they dont know what to do next hanna and spencer find the school files in a folder named hefty hanna asks how much is on there and spencer says that someone really wants caleb out of their way spencer yells at hanna to highlight all the files and press ctrl a on the keyboard which she does and the files are deleted one by one just in time caleb leaves the station and is greeted by a thrilled hanna they hug and hanna says he could have told him the meaning of 1105  november 5 the night they had sex for the first time caleb notes that there was an exclamation mark next to it and they embrace behind them a frustrated garrett leaves caleb says they should go but hanna says they should throw it in his face a little while longer and begins making out with caleb at school the liars discuss the payoff they arranged with jonah when emily asks how spencer got the money so fast she replies that it is from a relative who didnt want to be named aria and spencer plan to meet jonah at 6 pm and ask emily and hanna not to join them because he might get suspicious if they crowd him emily and hanna want to come along but eventually agree not to go just then mona comes by and pulls hanna aside to ask her about plans theyd made to shop for a dress for mona to wear to a party it is clear that hanna forgot about their plans and tries to reschedule for tomorrow at the same time mona receives a text from someone when hanna asks who it is from she brushes it off saying its just a wrong number later at hannas house officer wilden appears at the backdoor and wants to ask hanna more questions ashley blows wilden off and tells him that coming to their house is like this is harassment and so he decides to see them at the police station later hanna is with mona who is trying to decide on a dress mona gets another text from a and this time tells hanna about it she says its been happening since a few days ago and that the texts have been accusing her of shoplifting things hanna asks if any of the texts are about her to which mona replies that there are more about hannas mom she shows her a suggestive photo of ashley and officer wilden hanna lies and says its obviously photoshopped to which mona agrees when hanna questions what mona would do with the picture if the mystery texter started threatening her mona replies that if she can live through alison she can survive this radioactive texting hanna is still troubled by the picture mona had shown her so she tries to talk to ashley diplomatically about what would happen if anybody found out ashley replies that she could lose hanna because if hannas father wanted to sue for full custody he would easily get it with this information the girls gather in spencers bedroom where hanna tells the girls about ashleys sleeping with officer wilden to get the shoplifting charges dropped she also tells them mona has been getting texts from a about it when emily asks hanna how much shes told mona she replies that shes told her nothing but she feels bad about lying to her when hanna goes downstairs to get food spencer asks hanna to check if garrett is still outside as he followed her home after meeting jonah downstairs hanna has received an email from caleb its another part of ians video from alisons room surprisingly instead of alison walking into the room as they expected melissa storms in angrily asking where is she the girls are shocked and aria hanna and emily immediately want to turn melissa in but spencer gets extremely defensive the girls reluctantly decide to let spencer talk to melissa before they do anything at hannas house mona shows hanna the incident report from when hanna shoplifted the sunglasses the report was put into monas mailbox by a a had threatened mona to give the report and the photo of ashley and wilden to the rosewood observer or else shell be charged with shoplifting hanna tells mona about a and that the threat isnt a joke when mona asks about what a has done to her hanna doesnt know where to start when mona wants to know what to do about the report hanna isnt sure but promises she will think of something in time mona asks her to hurry showing her the text she got from a which gives her only until 10 am the next day to make a decision later hanna aria and emily go the address jonah gave them it is the house of an abandoned law firm office the door is locked so they look around aria sees a stack of letters in the mail slot and goes to investigate she pulls at a letter when suddenly a creepy old man yells back at her from inside an alarm goes off terrified she falls backward and hurts her leg the other girls help her up and they run away at hannas house aria nurses her wounds while hanna researches the law firm she finds out that the firm closed down 3 months ago she wants to find out who worked there hoping it leads them to another clue but aria decides they got scammed hanna is frustrated and realizes that either her mom or mona is going down and she doesnt like either possibility the next day at 1015 am hanna believing that mona turned her mom in goes to tell mona that she doesnt blame her mona reveals that she went to the jewelry store and returned the necklace she stole the store owners called the police and it ended with monas mom working it out so mona would get community service  serving food to the homeless hanna thanks her and mona replies that she wouldnt do anything that would hurt her best friend and her mom at school emily sits down with aria at the lunch table hanna passes by mona and sees the creepy message a slipped into her lunch mona wants to leave school and not be a sitting target but hanna invites her to sit with her and aria and emily mona agrees in the marin home that night ashley spots the letter aria had picked up lying on hannas bed she asks hanna what it is and hanna lies that it came in the mail by mistake ashley says its odd because it is addressed to fwl law firm the one that she used for her divorce hanna asks why she would use a law firm so far away and ashley says melissa hastings interned there that summer later that night emily wakes hanna when she returns from being questioned by officer barry apparently maya left her parents a note and packed a bag emily is frustrated that she hasnt heard from maya hanna thinks she should tell the cops that because every detail helps emily believes maya ran away just like she said she would and just wants to get some sleep the next morning hanna tells ashley that tom is bailing on the fatherdaughter dance at school due to a prior commitment ashley offers to take her to the dance despite it being for fathers and daughters because missing out on something hanna is looking forward to is lamer than showing up with her mother hanna agrees and seems to like the idea the girls stand outside at school to discuss the latest text from a they accuse melissa of being a but spencer insists it is impossible aria worries that melissa may know about the n a t videos spencer explains how devastated melissa was to find ian dead and continues to insist there is no way she could be a hanna thinks they should turn the video over to the cops anyway because it is evidence but the other girls all agree turning over evidence to the cops has not worked in their favor in the past they allow spencer to try to get to the bottom of it on her own before doing anything hanna tells mona that caleb is in montecito with his family as they walk down main street at night then she asks if mona has gotten any new texts from a she says no and begins to complain about the community service she has to do they spot ashley and wilden parked across the street talking hanna looks worried hanna confronts her mom as soon as she arrives home she asks if they are back together ashley denies it and tells hanna the truth she found the stolen police report amongst hannas things and wants to know where it came from hanna pretends not to know and is scared that it may get out ashley says she did the right thing by giving it to wilden because maybe he can keep her safe hanna walks away realizing nothing she says could convince ashley otherwise the next day ashley gives hanna one more chance to tell her everything she knows about that police report hanna still refuses to talk ashley demands hanna hand over her cell phone hanna can tell it was wildens idea even though ashley denies it instead of giving her mom the phone she tosses into a sink full of sudsy water and walks out hanna goes to the fatherdaughter dance and meets aria mona spencer and emily and informs them her mom is hot on the a trail ashley thinks the police report was sent to hanna not mona and gave it to wilden because she think it will keep them safe aria is worried now that both of their moms are looing for a and scared what a might do if they get too close hanna almost brings up dr sullivan but spencer cuts her off and says they need a creative solution to this problem mona has an idea it requires a big lie and apparently she is terrible at that she asks which one of them is the best liar and they all point to aria slightly affronted she asks mona what lie she has to tell aria sits in mrs marins kitchen and confesses to sending hanna that police report she tells ashley she had begged hanna to stop shoplifting because if she were to be caught again she could end up in jail aria says she made up that police report to scare hanna straight and admits that she is a for aria for anonymous aria apologizes and asks if there is anything else she can do but ashley says she can take it from here hanna arrives at arias room the next day wanting to know if her mom bought arias story aria has no idea she gets a call from jonah of all people which hanna urges her to answer spencers car pulls up next to some stores in brookhaven a nearby town the girls all get out of the car and aria explains that jonah told her alison had been getting texts from more than one number one of which led them here hanna wonders if melissa could still be a they stand on the sidewalk wondering where the calls could have originated from when aria spots a doll hospital a store full of antique dolls very similar to the dolls a sent when aria says she is cold spencer hands her the keys to get a coat out of the trunk not just any coat  vivians coat aria puts it on then hears a voice call out vivian she turns to see a young man staring at her later sitting outside lucky leons aria tells the others about duncan the boy who thought she was vivian she told him she was a friend of vivians and hasnt seen her since she gave her the coat he doesnt know alisonvivian is dead because he has been in florida the past year aria shows spencer duncans number and tells her he met vivian in a bookstore a few doors down from the creepy doll hospital jonah sent them to emily questions if duncan is just a random guy alison flirted with but spencer is sure ali wouldnt have wasted time flirting while trying to track down a aria decides to call him just then a car pulls up and jenna and toby emerge jennas eye bandaged postsurgery in the morning hanna argues with her mom about getting a replacement phone ashley wont get her a new one since hanna purposefully destroyed the old one she assures hanna that emily would allow her to use her phone in an emergency which emily cant argue with hanna is not satisfied with this solution ashley says when hanna is willing to share more about what is going on in her life they can talk about a new phone in the hall at school mona hands hanna an old cell phone which will bill to her account and stay off her moms radar when she leaves spencer makes a joke about monas sense of entitlement hanna is grateful she didnt need to ask caleb to help with the phone situation still worried about a hurting him while walking past the cavanaugh house aria tells the others that duncan admitted to seeing alison the weekend she disappeared spencer is surprised to hear this and hanna doubts if duncan is telling the truth but aria believes his reaction to hearing ali is dead was real garrett pulls away from the curb in a big hurry and the girls besides hanna all receive a text from a they see toby and jenna across the street discussing something with the fire department the girls all wonder if toby is telling them about the night of the jenna thing the next day at school mona makes some jokes and threats about jenna to hanna unhappy about how she poached noel kahn right out from under her she expresses that spencer should be grateful shes not with toby anymore but hanna knows how much spencer has been hurting she isnt so sure mona tells hanna that spencer is really smart and helped her through a tough breakup hanna wishes she could get toby away from jenna for 5 minutes to talk some sense into him mona immediately formulates a plan she texts toby and meets him in an empty classroom pretending to be looking for a truck for her cousin hanna enters the room and toby picks up on the scheme hanna tells him he cant let jenna back into his life just because hes angry with spencer toby tells her she has no idea what hes doing or why hes doing it and defends jenna his sister hanna asks if hes forgotten everything jenna did to him toby pointedly asks if hannas forgotten what she did to jenna then walks out that night hanna shows up to spencers house while spencer was returning the bag of alis things to jasons back porch they prepare a snack and hanna hopes she didnt make things worse with toby hanna accidentally sits on some newspaper and recognizes the first ladys outfit as something she wore 2 years ago spencer realizes the paper alis trinkets were wrapped in was from over a month before her disappearance indicating ali packed that stuff up herself well before her disappearance they find certain passages within the newspaper to be highlighted spencer instructs hanna to get the bag back off jasons porch while she calls aria and emily she pulls the other newspaper pages out of the trash when hanna picks up the bag off jasons porch she hears a noise come from inside she looks in the window and sees jenna collapse to the floor hanna runs inside and drags jenna out as spencer arrives to help smoke pours out the windows then an explosion rocks the house hanna and spencer stare in shock in the hospital aria fills in emily and hanna about the new information she got from duncan—he flew alison back to philly labor day weekend and she didnt take the bus like they thought hannas mom arrives and gives hanna a hug the girls go to see jenna in her room spencer and emily think jenna is going to accuse them of sending the text luring her to the house since jason didnt send it jenna starts crying and says she doesnt blame them she asks hanna why she dragged her out hanna simply replies youre welcome the girls gather in spencers bedroom to reexamine alis items hanna says they are the key to solving the mystery they assume a must have lured jenna into that house with the intention of killing her at the bottom of the bag emily finds a torn postcard and hanna finds a newspaper dated august filled with advertisements for events labor day weekend an event in rosewood is circled in red ink  a concert at the gazebo the music box creepily starts playing on its own startling the girls the next morning ashley hears a phone ringing and finds out about hannas secret phone which mona had given her hanna explains mona needs to be able to reach her 247 which ashley finds hard to believe mona walks in picking up hanna for school ashley gives her a warning and hands the phone back to her suggesting she should sleep over if the crisis is really that bad mona then pays mrs marin a compliment before leaving for school at school spencer finds out that alison and a had been communicating via newspaper classified ads and had planned to meet in person the girls realize the meeting place was on spruce street near the creepy doll hospital just then jenna and toby approach them hanna gets jumps right to the chase bluntly asking if jenna can see or not she shakes her head no and she says that hanna saving her made her realize that people can grow so now its her turn she is sorry and she wants to move on jenna then apologizes for hating them and for holding a grudge she goes on to say shes never been the person they really needed to fear and walks away the girls discuss what just transpired aria believes jenna to be sincere but emily doesnt buy her story thinking she must be as angry as ever if the surgery failed they ponder who jenna may have been referring to guessing garrett or melissa spencer believes ali had the answer and decides they must retrace her steps if they ever want to figure it out mona marches up to hanna in the hall upset about the latest hex er text from a that says if she doesnt break up hanna and her hottie shell go back to being a junior high nottie hanna lets slip she thinks jenna may be sending the texts and mentions going to brookhaven later before mona can find out more details caleb shows up when hanna invites mona to hang out with them that evening caleb doesnt look thrilled mona cant make it anyway but promises to be there afterwards for their slumber party the girls go to the doll store in brookhaven there they run into the owner an older woman named martha they ask if anyone had ever bought a voodoo doll the same as one alison received but martha says they dont sell those inside they speak with a creepy young boy named seth who apparently has a gift that allows him to see things that havent happened yet he tells them that alison was in the store two summers ago looking for a voodoo doll he said he warned her against it since a man and a woman with dark hair were trying to hurt her the couple was not jenna and garrett as the woman was not blind martha sends him upstairs but on his way out he says hes sorry for what happened to alison specifically citing her cause of death the girls are visibly freaked out later that night the girls argue about the validity of seths claims spencer comes clean about her parents belief that her sister could have had something to do with alisons death she also tells them about jason being her brother the girls are stunned spencer doesnt know what to think but she knows melissa had motive and opportunity to kill ali at school the next day hanna decides enough is enough they will trick melissa into texting them proving she is a once and for all hanna asks caleb to help with the plan to trap a he does not like the idea especially since it involves mona but ultimately agrees
