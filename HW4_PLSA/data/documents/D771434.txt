with heavy assignment and acute patient care is questionable i am looking into doing case management for a while before maybe going back to school to obtain my fnp i am posting this asking for guidanes advice how other had done it and what would be the best way i love working on the floor but i have to compromise at this point if i were to have another child i am saying this because with my first one i was so sick in first trimester i dont think ever making it through the day 12 shifts about born2brnjoined jun 12 posts 176 likes 6022 comments comment1 2 next »nov 22 12talk to the hiring manager at the hospital where you work or a former nursing employer ask that person if there are openings let himher know of your interest and ask how you would be considered for an entry level position that is the best way to get into case management good luck nov 22 12oh the land of 95 how i would love to be part of theeeeeee at my hospital the cm positions are extremely difficult to obtain but i keep putting in and hoping i am actually in my first trimester now and have been sick as a dog i am also really tired t he 12 hour shifts are literally killing me i am hoping the sickness passes soon otherwise i am not going to make it 9 months on my current floor i asked not to be scheduled 3 days in a row but every schedule comes out and i am 3 in a row and have to beg people to swap nov 23 12you can always look at insurance companies most have case managers that work from home where i work if someone doesnt have cm experience they at least like them to have home health experience because we visit our members in their homes if you are applying for telephonic case management then that might be even easier to get into nov 23 12i am a case manager rn i also have a good relationship with my hiring manager and know why she hired me so here ya go 1 bsn most medical groups insurance cos hospitals get better reimbursement and accreditation if cms have bsn 2 some experience in public health health teaching discharge planning chronic condition management or something along those lines lots of states offer phn licensure to bsns whose program curriculum included communitypublic health that meets requirements if you can get it get it my hiring manager and 3 or 4 other cms in my department were phns for some years before becoming cms  she says that pretty much nailed why they hired me highlight any nursing experience in which you developed therapeutic long term relationships with patients and followed them through chronic illness any telephone triage expertise or training is valuable too 3 get certified as a cm either by the commission for case manager certification or the ancc case manager board certification i cannot emphasize this enough 4 be prepared to sit in a cubicle all day calling patients to wear business clothes to earn salary instead of hourly and go to lots of meetings it is a far cry from working the floor the clinic or 12 hours in scrubs and its not always better it can be just as crazy busy complicated stressful and the grind of 95 mf isnt the paradise you might think we have had a couple of cms who came straight from inpatient bedside shift work nursing leave after 5 or 6 months because they missed working with patients and having those 3 or 4 days off a week and they missed overtime pay 5 on the upside its very autonomous independent work that actually uses nursing theory heavily and really sharpens your critical thinking skills docs love us patients love that they dont have to come to as many appointments and have a goto advocate case management is gonna be a big thing it saves everyone money and increases patient satisfaction scores big time and the pay is great if you have the experience and certification hope that helps and good lucknov 24 12wow it seems you need a lot of education and experience to become a case manager i know a couple of adns that have become cms and i was offered a job in cmhome health which i decided not to accept is this a good way to gain the experience to get a hospital position without the bsn i would love to get my bsn but it is so costly and time consuming i have taken a couple of on line classes toward it and i just dont want to do it anymore currently i am ld nurse and looking to get into cm nov 26 12you must know case management before trying to be case manager cm is really a great profile to work on nov 29 12hello i am considering moving into a case management position i am moving to a new city and seeking a new job i am a new rn

good career field  lots of room for growth thank you for any repliesdec 1 12quote from annemarieoregon hello i am considering moving into a case management position i am moving to a new city and seeking a new job i am a new rn about 6 months of experience 1 is utilization review ur the samesimilar to case management utilization review and management urm is case management some nurses perform ur only or discharge planningchronic management only while others perform both quote from annemarieoregon 2 is home healthcase management a good place to start to get into hospital case management where you start and if it is a good fit depend on your personality and your opportunities as for getting into the hospital setting this will depend on employers most hiring managers in hospital settings prefer cms with acute care backgrounds of 25 years by the bedside a bsn and at least 1 year of cm work experience in the hospital setting however it is not unheard of that nurses with clinical backgrounds of several years outside of the hospital setting along with cm work experience of several years in other areas hh insurance workmans comp etc are recruited into the hospital setting as nurse case managers quote from annemarieoregon there is a ur job at the va in the city i am moving to that i would like to apply i am trying to consider my 5 year plan and determine if this is a good step for me i am currently a nurse in the er and as a new nurse not entirely sure if i want to continue the 12hour shifts of floor nursing or make a shift to the 9 to 5 i would love to have

with constant distractions and not feeling like i am in touch at all with my patients needs i believe i would really enjoy following a patient through from beginning to end case management is not stress free fun job for the most part also cm jobs in the h ospital setting are not always 95mf noweekendsorholidays jobs in fact my employers have noc and pm shifts and we are required to work weekends and holidays just like any other nurse hospitals admit and discharge patients 24 hours a day 7 days a week quote from annemarieoregon 3 is case management a good career field  lots of room for growth yes lots of room for career growth most of the growth however will be laterally as oppose to upward the reason being as with any field there are not a lot of places where one can get promoted due to cut backs on the other hand you can move around to different settings to different positions and to different facilities with experience education and certifications good luck dec 3 12i was hired as a telephonic case manager for a large medical insurance company after 2 years of medsurg and 6 years of home health care i do know a lot of home care nurses that have transitioned to case manager with insurance companies without a bsn home health and case management have their similarities in that both are teaching the patient to manage their diseases and helping them with community resources transportation to medical appointments etc personally i found telephonic case management to be extremely boring and left after a year dec 9 12im doing telephonic cm right now i have three years of medsurg and an msn but i think thats unusual most of my coworkers have experience in cm or umur or mental health but my company is kind of a mess lots of turnover so thats why i think i got hired with such a lack of experience and id echo what some of the others have said many times rns leave after they find they miss face to face interactions and 3 12 hour shifts so id think about how id like a business environment even for someone like myself who likes this sort of field i find that cm is probably not the best fit id probably do better with less patient interaction and more clinical data such as umur or quality or provider services but the good thing about this field is that there are many different positions available dec 10 12i was hired as a hospital based case manager at a large teaching hospital in the midwest i am a diploma grad with 20 years of nursing experience at the bedside i am not certified but need to be within 2 years so sometimes experience can override the bsn requirement mar 2 13yes i agree the ccm certification is pretty important and that it isnt as great as you might think because you are working with lots of very high risk patients and you often dont see results and i usually have to work evenings because that is when the people we call in my company are easiest to reach but if it is a good fit try to get a job in home care or something and work on your ccm and talk to lots of nurses who are doing the job i work in an a big insurance company and we are always hiring and i think there are going to be more jobs maybe working in a big primary care practice many of them are looking for case managers now good luckmust read topics1 acute care case management vs home health0 advise for nightshift ld rn looking to transition to
