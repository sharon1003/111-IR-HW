a boys name i take pride in the fact that i can add a little femininity to a male name i love names like logan or spencer for a girl though or very feminine names like andrea or my sisters name alexandra with boyish nicknames andi and alex but take into consideration too that parents name their sons girl names all the time for instance rileyraleigh jessejessie and jaylynn two boys at my
