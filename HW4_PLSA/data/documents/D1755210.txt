morphological derivation from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from derivational morphologynavigation search morphological derivation in linguistics is the process of forming a new word from an existing word often by adding a prefix or suffix such as ness or un for example happiness and unhappy derive from the root word happy it is differentiated from inflection which is the modification of a word to form different grammatical categories without changing its core meaning determines determining and determined are from the root determine 1contents  hide 1 derivational patterns2

addition of a derivational suffix or other affix such an affix usually applies to words of one lexical category part of speech and changes them into words of another such category for example the english derivational suffix ly changes adjectives into adverbs  slow → slowly  here are examples of english derivational patterns and their suffixesadjectiveto noun ness  slow → slownessadjectiveto verb ise  modern → modernise in british english or ize  final → finalize in american english and oxford spellingadjectivetoadjective ish  red → reddishadjectiveto adverb ly  personal → personallynounto adjective al  recreation → recreationalnountoverb fy  glory → glorifyverbtoadjective able  drink → drinkableverbtonoun  abstract  ance  deliver → deliveranceverbtonoun  agent  er  write → writerhowever derivational affixes do not necessarily alter the lexical category they may change merely the meaning of the base and leave the category unchanged a prefix  write → rewrite lord → overlord rarely changes the lexical category in english the prefix un applies to adjectives  healthy → unhealthy and some verbs  do → undo but rarely to nouns a few exceptions are the derivational prefixes en and be en replaced by em before labials is usually a transitive marker on verbs but it can also be applied to adjectives and nouns to form transitive verbs circle verb → encircle verb but rich adj → enrich verb large adj → enlarge verb rapture noun → enrapture verb slave noun → enslave verb derivation can also occur without any change of form telephone noun and to telephone that is known as conversion or zero derivation derivation that results in a noun may be called nominalization it may involve the use of an affix such as with happy → happiness employ → employee  or it may occur via conversion such as with the derivation of the noun run from the verb to run  in contrast that result in a verb may be called verbalization such as from the noun butter to the verb to butter  derivation and inflection  editderivation can be contrasted with inflection in that derivation produces a new word a distinct lexeme  whereas inflection produces grammatical variants of the same word generally speaking inflection applies in more or less regular patterns to all members of a part of speech for example nearly every english verb adds s for the third person singular present tense while derivation follows less consistent patterns for example the nominalizing suffix ity can be used with the adjectives modern and dense but not with open or strong  however it is important to note that derivations and inflections can share homonyms that being morphemes that have the same sound but not the same meaning for example when the affix er is added to an adjective as in smaller it acts as an inflection but when added to a verb as in cooker it acts as a derivation 2derivation and other types of word formation  editderivation can be contrasted with other types of word formation such as compounding for full details see word formation note that derivational affixes are bound morphemes – they are meaningful units but can only normally occur when attached to another word in that respect derivation differs from compounding by which free morphemes are combined  lawsuit latin professor  it also differs from inflection in that inflection does not create new lexemes but new word forms  table → tables open → opened  productivity  editderivational patterns differ in the degree to which they can be called productive a productive pattern or affix is one that is commonly used to produce novel forms for example the negating prefix un is more productive in english than the alternative in both of them occur in established words such as unusual and inaccessible  but faced with a new word which does not have an established negation a native speaker is more likely to create a novel form with un than with in the same thing happens with suffixes for example if comparing two words thatcherite and thatcherist the analysis shows that both suffixes ite and ist are productive and can be added to proper names moreover both derived adjectives are established and have the same meaning but the suffix ist is more productive and thus can be found more often in word formation not only from proper names see also  editagglutination collocation inflection nominalization word formation
