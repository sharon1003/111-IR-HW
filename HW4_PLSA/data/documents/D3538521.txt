srcalpha trion is one of the thirteen cofounder of the cybertronian civilization along with alchemist prime and a high council member alpha trion served in iacon to send ancient relics to earth for optimus prime to find and get before the decepticons could get their hands on them contents  showhistory creation alpha trion was among the thirteen created by primus to battle and defeat unicron and witnessed the activation of the well of allsparks when solus prime was murdered by the fallen alpha trion took her forge of solus prime and many other relics of the primes after his brothers passed away after her and liege maximo s funeral and the loss of many brothers to the well of all sparks and to space alpha trion remained with prima to begin a new society he showed great interest in the newly spawned orion pax when the well of all sparks was first activated when the quintessons invaded alpha trion recognized them as quintus prime s creations he tried to fight back against their initial attacks and wondered what had happened to his brother after creating the first quintessons alpha trion joined sentinel zeta in besting the quintessons after they were defeated he was distressed by sentinels form of government and the fact that he took the title prime  eventually cybertronian society expanded out to the stars using space bridges however one ship became infected with a dreaded rust plague that swarmed through all the colonies no cure could be found and to protect cybertron all bridges save the one orbiting cybertron were destroyed alpha trion noted that everyone seemed to lose the will to live after that when sentinel prime created the caste system alpha trion voiced his opinion but sentinel exiled him to the hall of records to be forgotten desperate for any moral boost in cybertron he fled to vector sigma and begged the computer for a miracle it informed that his longlost brother would one day return but in his current form he needed alpha trions help the computer gave him the seal of vector prime  to allow him to better interact with the covenant of primus he eventually found his brother in the form of orion pax already at the hall of records alpha trion waited until the time was right to resurrect him alpha trion with the other primes choosing a new prime alpha trion persuaded halogen and the rest of the high council that orion pax should be made the new prime 1great war smokescreen was the main guard of alpha trion during the war alpha trion taught the young bot much and the two became great friends with smokescreen later saying alpha trion was a great teacher alpha trion trusted smokescreen enough to tell him about his involvement in optimus prime receiving his title and thought smokescreen was worthy to become a prime 2when optimus launched the all spark into space alpha trion forged an indestructible container capable of extracting its pure energy form from the ether alpha trion sent many relics to earth for optimus to use alpha trion speaking to optimus about the star saber and the omega keys one was the star saber in which he recorded a message about the omega keys and the omega lock as he was launching the final key the decepticons stormed iacon perhaps out of pure desperation he knocked out smokescreen and placed the final key within him knowing he would one day reach earth alpha trions fate is unknown as smokescreen states that was the last time he saw alpha trion when smokescreen was being told to behave better around humans ratchet asked him is this what alpha trion taught you when optimus acquired the star saber the recorded message from alpha trion played for him 3after hearing his mentors message optimus learned about the star saber the other relics and the omega lock which he kept the omega lock a secret from his team under alpha trions wishes 4persuading optimus choicei stand before you my student as such it would seem that it is your time why do you hesitate ―alpha trion to optimus in the all spark srcalpha trion talking to optimus to join the all spark when optimus was about to be one with the allspark he was met by alpha trion who asked why optimus hesistated optimus said he did not fear death but feared for the fate of the matrix alpha trion told optimus that smokescreen would be an excellent choice for a prime and that despite being young would learn how to be one just like optimus once did optimus hesitated leaving such a burden on smokescreen but was later restored to life thanks to smokescreen who revived optimus by placing the forge of solus prime on his hand this restored optimus in a new and stronger body personality alpha trion is a very calm and wise bot he is shown to be a great teacher as he mentored both optimus and smokescreen in the days before war he was desperate to prevent cybertrons death and tried to arrange a high council meeting which only created the war this act showed alpha trion truly loved cybertron it has also been shown he is not a fighter powers and abilities alpha trion is a member of the thirteen and one of the first beings ever created as such he had enormous power over the universe and is practically a demigod he is one of the original primes whose name is not known to the cybertronian public his artifact is the quill through which with the covenant of primus he can bend reality itself alpha trion does not use this power often as he knows the future is complicated and can often change despite his writings he can also see into the future though not in great detail for example he knew optimus would reach earth but he knew not the nature of the battle or its outcome or the combatants save optimus he only knew that earth was a battlefield that would decide the fate of cybertron and that smokescreen would join optimus relationships allies optimus primealpha trion knew many secrets ―optimus noting alpha trions ancient wisdom to his team when orion pax came to the hall of records alpha trion made sure he was cared for and acted like a mentor to the young bot little did orion know he was the thirteenth prime reincarnated to act as a medium between prime and lesser cybertronian alpha trion often gave orion advice and pushed on the path of reawakening his true self once he was reborn optimus became eternally grateful to alpha trion and still thought of him as a great mentor when optimus asked smokescreen about alpha trions fate smokescreen stated the last time he saw alpha trion was before the fall of iacon which made optimus look very dispirited upon hearing so when optimus received a message from alpha trion via the star saber it was simply a recording message alpha trion had left for optimus to view and be aware of the iacon relics the omega keys and the omega lock when optimus was about to become one with the all spark alpha trion was in optimuss vision as he tried to convince optimus to join the all spark while optimus hesitated alpha trion assured him that the matrix of leadership would choose a prime in his place however smokescreen was able to use the forge to resurrect optimus in a new body alpha trion is a wise mentor and father figure to optimus as he sees optimus as a true warrior and a studious pupil smokescreen smokescreen was alpha trions body guard something the young bot did not enjoy at first alpha trion however opened up to him and taught him many things resulting in the two becoming fast friends one of the things he told smokescreen was that he was the one who petitioned to halogen and the high council to make orion the next prime smokescreen uses this knowledge to gained the trust of optimus when he first arrived on earth alpha trion seemed to regard smokescreen as a second orion pax and thought he could one day become a prime in predacons rising as unicron revives his undead predacon army the signal appeared at the warship smokescreen states what in alpha trions beard is that enemies shockwave alpha trion battled shockwaves regime after the exodus alpha trion never faced shockwave in physical combat and seemed to engage in mental warfare whenever the cyclops entered the hall of records striking fear into his opponent shockwave never fought alpha trion in the show mainly because alpha trion is one with the all spark  trivia alpha trion has a similar personality and appearance of oogway from the kung fu panda movies they are both elderly they are both teachers to their students and they both have successors  oogway having po as his successor and alpha trion having optimus prime as his successor as well they are both wise knowledgeable and have puzzling ways they display to their students which proves helpful to them appearances one shall rise part 2 shown in flashbacknew recruit mentioned onlylegacy first
