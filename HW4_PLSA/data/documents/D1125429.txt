joined jan 2008 posts 4720 fredericksburg texas it makes no difference what kind of media you use you need to use a supplied air helmet i have a bullard that i used when we still hauled fertilizer and had to blast and paint a lot i still have a 600 lb pot and i doubt that i will ever blast again its very hard work if you do blast make sure you degrease everything first if you dont you will beat the grease into the metal sand blasting is for rust and paint removal not grease removal also if you do blast primer it immediately it will rust over night re how much sand will be needed to sandblast

think the only items that you dint sandblast were the tires and windows and i gotta say also youre a real a glutten for punishment after doing one rear fender on a hot summer day with a 200 fresh air hood from tcp using a 110 lb pressure pot from hf several guns and nozzles from both places and god knows how much wear and tear on my 80 gallon 5 hp craftsman compressor to me its a bargan to take anything up to the commercial blaster in town and let him do it i did have the front clip chemicaly stripped this summer and im convinced that is the only way to go from now on no matter what it costs i have over my past 67 years sand blasted a lot of items that would fit into a blast cabinet most of the places that i have worked have had blast cabinets that we could use if we kept them up and did it on our own time thats not to bad and if i had one of those here at home now that im retired id blast a lot of the small items myself but from now on the big jobs out of doors free in the air sand blasting is gonna be left up to the big boys denny graham sandwich ilre how much sand will be needed to sandblast frame  re denny graham  578821tue sep 29 2009 0126 pmachipmunk boltergeist joined dec

time headaches and total useage if it wont fit in my blasting cabinet it goes to the big boys in my case its the local monument place i would have saved money had i let them do my blasting not to
