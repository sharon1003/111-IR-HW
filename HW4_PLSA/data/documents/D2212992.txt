i need to fix this problem asap update i somehow arrived here and i dont know what to do ill wait at this screen until someone helps me reply i have the same question 13replies 8dr drevikkdrevik replied on july 30 2015if you upgrade to windows 10 and only get a black screen  i had three computers with this issue and spent 5 hours on it including 1 hour with microsoft they accidently fixed it enough for me to figure out the real problem windows 10 was treating our single screen computers as if they had dual monitors  the black screen was the other monitor so ultimately we were eventually able to right click on the screen and bring up display settings and delete the extra nonexistant monitor our dual monitor computer also had a similiar problem reading three screens instead of two and again we went into the display settings and deleted the nonexistent monitor if you mouse is not showing on the black screen try scrolling right or left the length of a monitorreply did this solve your problem yes no bi biancajaggar replied on july 31 2015in reply to drevikkdreviks post on july 30 2015i tried doing this and nothing happened i only see a black screen no matter what button i press

completed through to 100 and then it went through the upgrade to 100 displayed the comforting page that i should expect a few reboots to complete the install and to sit back and relax after the first reboot the pc came up with black screens on both my monitors and a cursor that will move between the two screens although they are in the reverse order to what they actually are it sat like this for hours until i rebooted with great trepidation now i can boot in any mode safe safe with networking i just get the same black screen with cursor i have disconnected all devices and reduced my monitors to 1 using the vga cable on my monitor nothing seems to help no idea how to recover from windows 10 other than to rebuild my pc back to windows 81 reply did this solve your problem yes no da daniel currie replied on july 31 2015in reply to terry g hendersons post on july 31 2015i have the exact same problem i upgraded and waited for 2 hours it had gone through all the various downloads and had copied all files it had told me to sit back and relax and after a while it seemed like it had done everything but the screen was just black no cursor nothing so foolishly or not i restarted the computer using the power button it now will restart show the square windows10 logo and say please wait before blinking and then going to a blankblack screen where i have no response at all from any command i have tried a second screen i have managed to get in via safemode with networking but for some reason i cannot get connected to the net properly to run windows update and search for any available patches where can we find help for this reply did this solve your problem yes no tg terry g henderson replied on july 31 2015in reply to daniel curries post on july 31 2015i noticed that my graphics card has a hdmi interface so as a last resort i borrowed a hdmi to vga converter plugged it into another screen and low and behold there was my windows 10 configuration screens so windows 10 will assume that all graphics card interfaces are being used and assume that the hdmi interface is the primary and only display on that one omg  i have wasted hours with this please check all display interfaces as it will be the one you will need if you dont see anything except a mouse cursor on a black screen reply did this solve your problem yes no da daniel currie replied on august 4 2015in

similiar problem reading three screens instead of two and again we went into the display settings and deleted the nonexistent monitor if you mouse is not showing on the black screen try scrolling right or left the length of a monitori upgraded to windows 10 and started having problems right from the start first i had a blue screen but was eventually able to resolve that problem then i noticed that the weather app in the start screen had washington dc instead of my home town i successfully changed that but it later reverted to the old ways and i was unable to change it or even get a settings option shown on the weather app screen that screen was only in view for about 2 seconds and then disappeared then the worst occurred i had booted up my pc 2 days ago and i got the login screen within seconds but after i typed in my password it typically took 20  30 minutes before windows 10 would finally show my personal screen or any screen at all it was in this mode 2 days ago when we were going out and i decided to shut it down and leave before it finished now heres the situation and its in a vicious loop that i cant escape heres the sequence it boots up and appears to complete post and immediately goes to a black screen ive let it sit there for as long as 2 hours with no apparent resolution or change whether i shut off my pc or press ctrlaltdelete i get the same result it boots and immediately goes to a black screen ive tried to press f2 to go to my bios screen but it wont even let me do that it just goes to a black screen and theres no other action i was running win 7x64 pro and would happily welcome the opportunity to return to that old somewhat reliable os i seriously regret upgrading to win 10 and i am sorry i did this i have recommended it to some friends and coworkers but will retract my recommendations i regret doing the upgrade reply did this solve your problem yes no he henry coetzee replied on july 29 2016hi guys i also sat with the problem black
