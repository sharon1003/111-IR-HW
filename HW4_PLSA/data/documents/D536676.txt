colon large intestine when a piece of the small intestine is used to create an ostomy it’s called an ileostomy when a piece of the colon is used to create an ostomy it’s called a colostomy the consistency of your bowel movements from your ostomy will depend on the part of your intestine that’s used to create the ostomy your bowel movements may be liquid soft or solid the most common types of ostomies are ileostomy created from the part of the small intestine called the ileum bowel movements are loose or watery stoma is usually located on the right lower side of the abdomen ascending colostomy created out of the ascending colon bowel movements are loose or watery stoma is usually located on the right side of the abdomen descending colostomy created out of the descending colon bowel movements are usually soft stoma is usually located on the left side of the abdomen sigmoid colostomy created out of the last part of the colon bowel movements can be soft or firm stoma is usually located on the left side of the abdomen loop ostomy can be made out of any part of the small intestine or colon there are 2 openings in the stoma instead of 1 many times only 1 opening can be seen this type of ostomy is often temporary in some surgeries a second opening is created on the abdomen called a mucous fistula it secretes left over bowel movements or a mucuslike fluid and leads to the rectum if you have a mucous fistula your woc nurse will teach you how to care for it while you’re in the hospital usually a small pouch or dressing is placed over the mucous fistula it will need to be cleaned with water and emptied once there is no drainage the mucus fistula can be covered with a pad and tape back to top learning to care for your ostomy your woc nurse and nursing staff will teach you how to care for your stoma and ostomy while you’re in the hospital when you’re discharged from the hospital you’ll be given the basic supplies you need to care for your ostomy during your postoperative appointment a woc nurse will reevaluate your ostomy supplies and will show you how to order them there’s a list of medical suppliers at the end of this resource your woc nurse and nursing staff will also arrange for a visiting nurse to come to your home after you’re discharged from the hospital they will teach you how to care for your stoma and adjust to being home if you have any questions or problems once you’re home call your woc nurse or social worker pouching systems after your surgery you will wear an odorproof pouching system over your ostomy the pouching system is made up of a skin barrier wafer and a collection pouch there are many different sizes and styles of pouching systems most pouching systems are either a 1piece system in which the pouch is attached to the skin barrier or a 2piece system in which the pouch can be taken off of the skin barrier with both types the pouch attaches to your abdomen by the skin barrier and is fitted over and around your stoma to collect your bowel movements and gas the skin barrier protects the skin around your stoma from getting irritated by bowel movement leakage your woc nurse will help you find the best pouching system for your stoma as the size of your stoma changes you may need to change your pouching system some people find it helpful to buy a fitted waterproof mattress cover bed pads or cloth underpads to place over the mattress and bed sheets this protects the bed in case the pouch accidentally leaks during the night emptying your pouch empty your pouch when it’s almost halfway full the pouch shouldn’t become overly full your woc nurse will teach you how to empty your pouch if you squeeze every bit of air out your pouch the sides are likely to stick together and make it more difficult to collect bowel movements there are lubricants to help keep this from happening this is more of an issue if your bowel movements are thicker if your bowel movements are thinner you can use a thickening product in the pouch to help thicken them your woc nurse will help you determine which product you should use changing your pouching system your woc nurse will teach you how to change your pouching system generally you should change your pouching system every 3 to 5 days if you have leakage change it immediately this is to protect the skin around your stoma from getting irritated from bowel movement leakage if you have any leakage or irritation that has lasted for a few days call your woc nurse back to top lifestyle issues body image and depression after people learn that they have cancer they often view their bodies in a different way surgery chemotherapy and radiation therapy can change the way a body looks and works this may be especially true when someone has a new ostomy some people feel disgust this is normal given the shame in many cultures of talking about bowel movements other people feel sadness at the loss or change in their bodies they view their ostomy with negative thoughts and feelings however others view their ostomy more positively and see it as an answer to difficult symptoms such as bowel incontinence trouble controlling your bowel movements or as the path to survival you may have both positive and negative feelings as you adjust to living with an ostomy and get used to how it looks and works you’ll feel better about your body it may help you cope better if you look at your stoma to help you get comfortable with it remind yourself about the positive aspects of your ostomy talk with other people with ostomies you may learn good coping techniques and this may help you regain a sense of normalcy get counseling to help you improve your body image feelings and quality of life at memorial sloan kettering msk counseling is available from social workers and at the counseling center you can reach the social work department at 2126397020 and the counseling center at 6468880200 nutrition your doctor will give you dietary guidelines to follow after your surgery you’ll also meet with a dietitian while you’re in the hospital to review these guidelines below are some recommended guidelines if you have an ileostomy stay hydrated drink 8 to 10 8ounce glasses of liquids a day limit your intake of caffeine and alcohol they can dehydrate you limit foods high in fiber and high in simple sugars such as glucose sucrose fructose as they can dehydrate you keep in mind that the foods that upset your stomach before your surgery will have the same effect after your surgery if you feel bloating and pain after eating a certain food remove it from your diet try eating it again in a few weeks if you’re still having pain and bloating after eating this food avoid it some people with ostomies choose to limit gas by regulating their diet the following can increase gas foods such as cabbage and broccoli carbonated beverages drinking through a straw chewing gum if you have tried limiting gas and still have a problem talk with your woc nurse they may suggest using pouches with charcoal filters the filter can help prevent the buildup of gas and avoid inflation of the pouch some people also find it useful to use pouches with filters for airplane travel don’t prick your pouch to release builtup gas because this will destroy the pouch’s odor proof system don’t scrub your pouch with water this will deactivate the filter if you’re constipated having fewer bowel movements than what’s normal for you drink more liquids eat foods that are high in fiber such as fruits vegetables and bran walk around if you have an ileostomy don’t take any kind of laxative it can cause severe dehydration and other problems medication if you have an ileostomy your body may not be able to completely absorb some medications this happens because your bowel is shortened and some medications are absorbed slowly this happens most often with pills with enteric coating a special coating that prevents pills from being absorbed until they reach the small intestinesustainedrelease or extended release medications designed to release a medication in the body slowly over an extended period of timeask your doctor if you’re taking these types of medications if you see a tablet in your pouch that isn’t absorbed call your doctor don’t crush pills unless your doctor or pharmacist says you can do so taking crushed pills can cause problems with digestion exercise talk with your doctor about what exercise is right for you for most people walking and light stretching are good exercises to do while recovering from surgery you should avoid lifting or pushing anything heavier than 10 pounds for 2 to 3 months after your surgery this includes housework such as vacuuming or mowing the lawn if this will be a problem for you talk with your doctor don’t do situps pushups or any strenuous exercise for 2 to 3 months after your surgery this will help prevent a hernia bulging of an organ or tissue or weakening of a muscle near your stoma it will also help prevent a stomal hernia bulging out of your stoma odor control pouching systems are designed to be odor proof unless you’re leaking bowel movements underneath the wafer there should be no odor while the pouching system is attached however if odor is a problem for you there are deodorants that you can put into the pouch to help some examples are drops charcoal tablets or lubricating gel you may need to experiment to find one that works best for you there are also deodorants you can take orally by mouth to decrease your bowel movement’s odor check with your doctor or nurse before using any of these many pouches have a builtin charcoal filter this vents the gas and filters it at the same time to prevent odor there are also filters that can be bought separately and attached to the pouch or you can apply a small plastic vent on each pouch this vent allows gas to be released without opening the pouch some people find it useful to empty the pouch at bedtime this is done because gas could continue to build overnight and fill the pouch sexual activity talk with your doctor about when it’s safe to resume sexual activity generally this is after your incision is healed about 2 months after your surgery as long as excessive pressure isn’t placed on your stoma there should be no harm done to it do not use your stoma as a sexual orifice for many people returning to a normal sex life will come naturally this happens as your concerns decrease and your feelings about your body become more positive try to stay intimate with your partner as much as possible use kind words meaningful touch and hugs check to see if your pouching system fits well and if there’s any odor some people prefer to cover their pouching system with a cloth band or wrap shirt or lingerie during sexual activity you can buy readymade covers from many ostomy supply companies some companies also make a pouch with a cotton cover attached to it you may also plan your sexual activity for times when you’re less likely to be actively draining or after irrigation for more information about irrigation see the section titled “frequently asked questions about ostomy care” talk with your doctor or nurse if surgery or radiation therapy caused changes that make it hard to have sex examples are erectile dysfunction difficulty getting or keeping an erection in men or vaginal dryness pain or tightness in women if these problems don’t get better you can talk with a sexual health specialist msk has a sexual health program to help people address the impact of their disease and treatment on sexuality the united ostomy associations of america inc  wwwostomyorg or 8008260826 has information on sex for both men and women with ostomies other good sources of information are the following

wwwcancerorgtreatmenttreatmentsandsideeffectsphysicalsideeffectsfertilityandsexualsideeffectssexualityforwomenwithcancerhtml showering bathing and swimming you can shower with your pouching system on or off however if you have an ileostomy you may want to keep the pouch on during the shower due to possible drainage of bowel movements while showering you can also use waterproof tape around the edges of the wafer depending on your skin and the type of pouch you can place a piece of plastic over the whole pouching system to keep it from getting wet but this isn’t always necessary when you take a bath or swim keep your pouching system on most people can wear the same swimsuit they wore before their surgery however it may not be possible to wear hiphigh swimsuits for men or hiphigh twopiece swimsuits for women work you can go back to work as soon as you feel ready and your doctor approves unless you tell them people won’t know that you have an ostomy it’s highly unlikely that the pouching system will be visible you will probably be able to wear most of the same clothes you wore before your surgery travel bring extra pouching systems with you wherever you go even if it’s only a short trip or a doctor’s appointment if you’re going to be away from home for several hours think about where you’re going and mentally prepare yourself some people feel anxiety the first few times they travel if you feel anxious you may be able to lower your stress by thinking ahead first think about where the bathroom is located and what you may need second get the supplies you plan to take with you place 2 of every item in a travel bag this way if you have an emergency or are away from home longer than you expect you will be prepared remember to bring pouches wafers clamps if you have a pouching system with a clamp closurepaper towels when you’re traveling by air pack your ostomy supplies in at least 2 places such as in your carryon and checked luggage take extra supplies in case you’re stranded where supplies may not be available you may want to bring a letter from your doctor stating your need for ostomy supplies as well as a private area be used in case of an extended search by tsa agents if you’re traveling to a foreign country it’s a good idea to have ostomy information written in that language one of the 70 member associations of the international ostomy association may be able to help with this translation as well as with locating supplies while visiting their country for more information visit wwwostomyinternationalorg you may want to carry photocopies of the catalogue pages displaying and explaining your equipment for tsa agents the united ostomy association of america web site  wwwuoaaorg has information and helpful ‘travel tips’ that can be printed and used back to top call your doctor or nurse if you vomit have a colostomy and haven’t had a bowel movement for 3 days have an ileostomy and haven’t had a bowel movement for 3 to 6 hours develop abdominal pain or symptoms of dehydration this is more common for those with an ileostomy including increased thirst dry mouth loss of appetite weakness decreased urine output dark amber colored urine muscle abdominal or leg cramps feeling faint more bowel movements than usual or changes in consistency increased frequency of emptying pouch back to top frequently asked questions about ostomy care what is irrigation and will i be able to do it irrigation is a type of enema that eliminates the need for wearing a pouching system over the stoma this means you wouldn’t have any bowel movements between the irrigations irrigation is done every day or every other day people who have a sigmoid colostomy may be able to irrigate most people who have had an abdominal perineal resection have a sigmoid colostomy people with an ileostomy should never irrigate because it can cause dehydration you also cannot irrigate if you have a stomal hernia bulge around the stoma while you’re getting chemotherapy while you’re getting radiation therapy ask your doctor or woc nurse for more information about irrigation what color should my stoma be your stoma should be a deep pink or red color at all times while it’s working to move bowel movements out of your body you may notice a slight change in its color this should only be for a few seconds to a minute if your stoma looks dark red grey brown or black call your doctor immediately is it normal for my stoma to bleed when i touch it or change my pouching system your stoma has many blood vessels so it may bleed easily with touch or irritation it’s common to have a small amount of blood on the tissue when cleaning your stoma the bleeding should stop on its own within a few minutes if you’re on a blood thinner or aspirin you may bleed more easily and for a longer period of time if you bleed a lot or if the bleeding doesn’t stop after 5 to 10 minutes apply pressure to the area and call your doctor if you notice blood in your bowel movements or coming from the inside of your stoma call your doctor immediately the area around my stoma seems to bulge is this normal if you have a change in the curve around your stoma tell your doctor or woc nurse you may have a stomal hernia this happens because the abdominal wall muscle is weak and causes a bulge to form in the area around the stoma your doctor or woc nurse will examine you to see if you have a stomal hernia people with a stomal hernia don’t usually have any symptoms surgery isn’t needed unless you have a complication including a blockage or twisting of the herniated bowel if you have any of the following symptoms call your doctor or nurse nausea vomiting pain abdominal bloating and lack of gas and bowel movements in your pouch if you have a stomal hernia your woc nurse can measure you for a custommade hernia support belt these belts don’t cure the hernia but they can prevent it from getting worse by giving it support a girdle or biking shorts with a hole cut out for your pouch may also work well as an alternative to the customfitted hernia belt how do i wear a belt over my stoma try to wear the belt above or below your stoma if the belt is worn directly over your stoma it can cause irritation bleeding an overgrowth of tissue while you’re wearing the belt position your pouch downward or to the side you can also fold it depending on your preference what do i do if i have leakage of bowel movements under my wafer if you’re having leakage tell your woc nurse you may need a different pouching system that fits better to avoid this problem is there anything i should do to prepare for tests such as scans with contrast dye always take an extra set of supplies when going to the doctor for tests because you may have to remove your pouching system if you live 1 hour or longer away from the hospital be ready to change or empty your bag during the trip home the contrast dye may empty into your pouch in 1 or 2 hours but it can take longer do i need to wear gloves when i change my pouching system this is a personal choice there is no risk of infection from changing your pouching system however some people prefer to wear gloves because some bowel movements could come in contact with your fingers if i have an ileostomy is it normal to still pass bowel movements or mucous from my rectum depending on the type of surgery you had you may pass left over bowel movements or mucous from your rectum this should decrease over time but it may be useful to wear a pad and apply a zinc ointment such as desitin ® around your anus to prevent irritation what should i do if i am admitted to the hospital if you’re admitted to the hospital you may want to bring 1 or 2 extra sets of supplies with you just in case they stock a different product
