demit also spelled dimit as a verb this hails from the latin dimettere to send away to release to let go we have it in our dismiss to dimit from an organization is using the official form to resign to relinquish ones membership it has this meaning in masonry source 100 words in masonry dimit or demitin brother mackeys opinion this is a modern american and wholly indefensible corruption of the technical word demit as the use of this form is very prevalent among american masonic writers he considered it proper that we should inquire which is the correct word demit or dimit and so he continues thus the masonic world had been content in its technical language to use the word demit but within a few years a few admirers of neologismsmen who are always ready to believe that what is old cannot be good and that new fashions are always the besthave sought to make a change in the wellestablished word and by altering the e in the first syllable into an i they make another word dimit which they assert is the right one it is simply a question of orthography and must be settled first by reference to usage and then to etymology to discover which of the words sustains by its derivation the true meaning which is intended to be conveyed it is proper however to premise that although in the seventeenth century sir thomas browne used the word debit as a verb meaning to depress and bishop hall used dimit as signifying to send away yet both words are omitted by all the early lexicographers neither of them is to be found in phillips in 1706 nor in blunt in 1707 nor in bailey in 1739 johnson and sheridan of a still later date have inserted in their dictionaries debit but not dignity but walker richardson and webster give both words but only as verbs the verb to debit or to dimit may be found but never the noun a debit or a dimit as a noun substantive this word however it may be spelled is unknown to the general language and is strictly a technical expression peculiar to freemasonry as a masonic technicality we must then discuss it and first as to its meaning doctor oliver who omits dimit in his dictionary of symbolical masonry defines remit thus a mason is said to debit from the order when he withdraws from all connection with it it will be seen that he speaks of it here only as a verb and makes no reference to its use as a noun macoy in his cyclopaedia omits debit but defines dimit thus from the latin dimitto to permit to go the act of withdrawing from membership to say nothing of the incorrectness of this definition to which reference will hereafter be made there is in it a violation of the principles of language which is worthy of note no rule is better settled than that which makes the verb and the noun derived from it have the same relative signification thus to discharge means to dismiss a discharge means a dismission to approve means to express liking an approval means an expression of liking to remit means to relax a remission means a relaxation and so with a thousand other instances now according to this rule if to demit means to permit to go then a remit should mean a permission to go the withdrawal is something subsequent and consequent but it may ever take place according to macoys definition of the verbs the granting of a limit does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the freemason who received it has left the lodge he has only been permitted to do so this is contrary to the universally accepted definition of the word accordingly when he comes to define the word as a noun he gives it the true meaning which however does not agree with his previous definition as a verb to instituting the inquiry which of these two words is the true one we must first look to the general usage of masonic writers for after all the rule of horace holds good that in the use of words we must be governed by custom or usage whose arbitrary sway words and the forms of language must obey if we shall find that the universal usage of masonic writers until a comparatively recent date has been to employ the form demit then we are bound to believe that it is the correct form notwithstanding a few writers have more recently sought to intrude the form dimit upon us now how stands the case the first time that we find the word demit used is in the second edition of andersons constitutions 1738 page 153 there it is said that on the 25th of november 1723 it was agreed that if a master of a particular lodge is deposed or demits the senior warden shall forthwith fill the masters chair the word continued in use as a technical word in the freemasonry of england for many years in the editions of the constitution published in 1756 page 311 the passage just quoted is again recited and the word debit is again employed in the fourth edition of the constitutions published in 1767 page 345 in the second edition of dermotts ahiman rezon published in 1764 page 52 and in the third edition published in 1778 page 58 the word debit is employed oliver it will be seen uses it in his dictionary published in 1853 but the word seems to have become obsolete in england and to resign is now constantly used by english masonic writers in the place of to debit in america however the word has been and continues to be in universal use and has always been spelled until recently debit thus we find it used by tannehill manual 1845 page 59 morris code of masonic law 1856 page 289 hubbard in 1851 chase digest 1859 page 104 mitchell masonic history volume ii pages 556 592 and by all the grand lodges whose proceedings brother mackey examined up to the year 1860 on the contrary the word dimit is of recent origin usage therefore both english and american is clearly in favor of demit and dimit must be considered as an interloper and ought to be consigned to the tomb of the capulets and now we are to inquire whether this usage is sustained by the principles of etymology first let us obtain a correct definition of the word to demit in masonic language means simply to resign the freemason who demits from his lodge resigns from it the word is used in the exact sense for instance in the constitution of the grand lodge of wisconsin where it is said no brother shall be allowed to demit from any lodge unless for the purpose of uniting with some other that is to say no brother shall be allowed to resign from any lodge now what are the respective meanings of debit and dimit in ordinary language there the words are found to be entirely different in signification to debit is derived first from the latin demittere through the french demettre in latin the prefixed particle de has the weight of down added to the verb mittere to send it signifies to let down from an elevated position to a lower thus caesar used it in this very sense when in describing the storming of avaricum commentary de bello gallico vii 28 he says that the roman soldiers did not let themselves down that is descend from the top of the wall to the level ground the french looking to this reference to a descent from a higher to a lower position made their verb se demettre used in a reflective sense signify to olive up a post office or occupation that is to say to resign it and thence the english use of the word is reducible which makes to demit signify go region we have another word in our language also derived from demettre and in which the same idea of resignation is apparent it is the word demise which was originally used only to express a loyal death the old maxim was that the king never dies so instead of saying the death of the king they said the demise of the king thereby meaning his resignation of the crown to his successor the word is now applied more generally and we speak of the demise of pitt or any other person to dimit is derived from the latin dimittere the prefixed particle di or dis has the effect of off from and hence dimittere means to send away thus terence uses it to express the meaning of dismissing or sending away an army both words are now obsolete in the english language they were formerly used but in the different senses already indicated thus hollinshed employs demit to signify a surrender yielding up or resignation of a franchise bishop hall uses dimit to signify a sending away of a servant by his master demit as a noun is not known in good english the correlative nouns of the verbs to demit and to dimit are demission and dimission a demit is altogether a masonic technicality and is moreover an americanism of recent usage it is then evident that to demit is the proper word and that to use to dimit is to speak and write incorrectly when a freemason demits from a lodge we mean that he residers from a lodge because to demit means to resign but what does anyone mean when he says that a freemason dimits from a lodge to dimit means as we have seen to send away therefore he dimits from the lodge is equivalent to saying he sends away from the lodge which of course is not only bad english but sheer nonsense if dimit is to be used at all as it is an active transitive verb it must be used only in that form and we must either say that a lodge dimits a mason or that a mason is dimitted by his lodge brother mackey believed he had discovered the way in which this blunder first arose rob morris code of masonic law page 289 has the following passage a demit technically considered is the act of withdrawing and applies to the lodge and not to the individual a mason cannot demit in the strict sense buff the lodge may demit dismiss him it is astonishing how the author of this passage could have crowded into so brief a space so many violations of grammar law and common sense first to demit means to withdraw and then this withdrawal is made the act of the lodge and not of the individual as if the lodge withdrew the member instead of the member withdrawing himself and immediately afterward seeing the absurdity of this doctrine and to make the demission the act of the lodge he changes the signification of the word and makes to demit mean to dismiss certainly it is impossible to discuss the law of masonic demission when such contrary meanings are given to the word in one and the same paragraph but certain wiseacres belonging probably to that class who believe that there is always improvement in change seizing upon this latter definition o f morris that to demit meant to dismiss and seeing that this was a meaning which the word never had and from its derivation from demittere never could have changed the word from demit to dimit which really does have the meaning of sending away or dismissing but as the masonic act of demission does not mean a dismissal from the lodge because that would be an expulsion but simply a resignation the word dimit cannot properly be applied to the act a freemason demits from the lodge he resigns he takes out his demit a strictly technical expression and altogether confined to this country he asks for and receives an acceptance of his resignation thus far we have followed brother mackey who went into this matter in considerable detail an equally impressive showing is to be found in the builder volume v page 308 where brother c c hunt discusses the same question at the end of his article the editor brother h l haywood said a study of fortynine codes of the grand lodges of the united states reveals the fact that fortyone used he word dimit while but eight used demit brother hunt page 29 volume vi builder comments upon this note in brief as follows dimit came into the english language through church usage where a priest would be sent from one diocese to another the bishop gave him a dimit virtually an order to go the priest had to accept dismissal this word is obsolete since letter of dismissal or dimissory letter takes its place demit came into the language from the same latin word but from the late latin and the french and meaning a voluntary resignation it so came to be used by freemasons the thought being that a member of a lodge in good standing had an absolute right to relinquish his membership and obtain a certificate to that effect until comparatively recently the word used was demit history of the word has been lost and ecclesiastical rather than the masonic sense attached to the word by those that use dimit the lexicographer of the literary digest july 9 1927 page 68 has this to say of the distinction between demit and dimit as a verb the word demit designates to give up lay down or resign as an appointment to drop or east down depress as a noun it means a letter of dismissal specifically a recommendation given to a person removing from one masonic lodge to another in the sense of to release or dimiss demit is obsolete the verb dimit means to permit or to go away dismiss to send or give forth to grant or lease source mackeys encyclopedia of freemasonry
