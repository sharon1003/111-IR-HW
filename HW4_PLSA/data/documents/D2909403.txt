iii jefferson’s “original rough draught” of the declaration of independence a declaration of 1the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for a people to advance from that subordination in which they have hitherto remained  to assume among the powers of the earth the equal  independant station to which the laws of nature  of nature’s god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the change we hold these truths to be sacred  undeniable 2that all men are created equal  independant that from that equal creation they derive rights 3 inherent  inalienable among which are the preservation of life  liberty  the pursuit of happiness that to secure these ends governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government shall become destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it  to institute new government laying it’s foundation on such principles  organising it’s powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety  happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light  transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses  usurpations begun at a distinguished period  pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to subject 4 them to arbitrary power 5 it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government  to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies  such is now the necessity which constrains them to expunge their former systems of government the history of his present majesty is a history of unremitting injuries and usurpations among which no one fact stands single or solitary to contradict the uniform tenor of the rest all of which have in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world for the truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied by falsehoodhe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public goodhe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate  pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has neglected utterly to attend to themhe has refused to pass other laws for the accomodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation 6 a right inestimable to them  formidable to tyrants alone 7he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly  continually for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the peoplehe has refused 8for a long space of time 9to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without  convulsions withinhe has endeavored to prevent the population of these states for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither  raising the conditions of new appropriations of landshe has suffered the administration of justice totally to cease in some of these colonies refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powershe has made our judges dependant on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and amount of their salarieshe has erected a multitude of new offices by a selfassumed power  sent hither swarms of officers to harrass our people  eat out their substancehe has kept among us in times of peace standing armies  ships of warhe has affected to render the military independant of  superior to the civil powerhe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitutions and unacknoleged by our laws giving his assent to their pretended acts of legislation for quartering large bodies of armed troops among usfor protecting them by a mocktrial from punishment for any murders they should commit on the inhabitants of these statesfor cutting off our trade with all parts of the worldfor imposing taxes on us without our consentfor depriving us of the benefits of trial by juryfor transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offencesfor taking away our charters  altering fundamentally the forms of our governmentsfor suspending our own legislatures  declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoeverhe has abdicated government here withdrawing his governors  declaring us out of his allegiance  protectionhe has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns  destroyed the lives of our peoplehe is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death desolation  tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty  perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized nationhe has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes  conditions of existencehe has incited treasonable insurrections in our fellowsubjects 10with the allurements of forfeiture  confiscation of our propertyhe has waged cruel war against human nature itself violating it’s most sacred rights of life  liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him captivating  carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither this piratical warfare the opprobrium of infidel powers is the warfare of the christian king of great britain determined to keep open a market where men should be bought  sold he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce 11 and that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them by murdering the people upon whom he also obtruded them thus paying off former crimes committed against the liberties of one people with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of anotherin every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered by repeated injury a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a people who mean to be free future ages will scarce believe that the hardiness of one man adventured within the short compass of 12 12 years only on so many acts of tyranny without a mask over a people fostered  fixed in principles of liberty nor have we been wanting in attentions to our british brethren we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend a jurisdiction over these our states we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration  settlement here no one of which could warrant so strange a pretension that these were effected at the expence of our own blood  treasure unassisted by the wealth or the strength of great britain that in constituting indeed our several forms of government we had adopted one common king thereby laying a foundation for perpetual league  amity with them but that submission to their parliament was no part of our constitution nor ever in idea if history may be credited and we appealed to their native justice  magnanimity as well as to the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which were likely to interrupt our correspondence  connection they too have been deaf to the voice of justice  of consanguinity  when occasions have been given them by the regular course of their laws of removing from their councils the disturbers of our harmony they have by their free election reestablished them in power at this very time too they are permitting their chief magistrate to send over not only soldiers of our common blood but scotch  foreign mercenaries to invade  deluge us in blood these facts have given the last stab to agonizing affection and manly spirit bids us to renounce for ever these unfeeling brethren we must endeavor to forget our former love for them and to hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends we might have been a free  a great people together but a communication of grandeur  of freedom it seems is below their dignity be it so since they will have it the road to glory  happiness 13 is open to us too we will climb it in a separate state 14 and acquiesce in the necessity which pronounces 15 our everlasting adieu 16we therefore the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled do in the name  by authority of the good people of these states reject and renounce all allegiance  subjection to the kings of great britain  all others who may hereafter claim by through or under them we utterly dissolve  break off all political connection which may have heretofore subsisted between us  the people or parliament of great britain and finally we do assert and declare these colonies to be free and independant states and that as free  independant states they shall hereafter have power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce  to do all other acts and things which independant states may of right do and for the support of this declaration we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes  our sacred honour dft  dlc  endorsed by tj late in life “independance declaration of original rough draught”the text here presented approximates its state at the time tj transcribed it from the manuscript of which the fragment was a part document ii boyd declaration of independence 1945 p 18–22 and before john adams took off the copy in his own handwriting  ms in adams manuscript trust boston facsimile in boyd pl iv  the “rough draught” includes changes made in the text in the various stages of its evolution—changes made by tj himself by adams and franklin who were consulted separately by the committee or by congress the separation of the alterations made in these various stages has been traced in hazelton p 306–42 becker ch iv and boyd p 28–38 tj’s indication of the changes made during the progress of the text at its various stages may be seen in document iv in the present sequence of texts printed above with tj’s notes of proceedings in the continental congress 7 june to 1 aug 1776 the alterations made in the text as here presented with the possible exception of that indicated in note 9 were probably made by tj in the course of making the “rough draught” this was certainly true of those indicated in notes 13–161  tj first wrote “of” and then changed it to “by”2  the phrase “sacred  undeniable” was changed to “selfevident” before adams made his copy this change has been attributed to franklin but the opinion rests on no conclusive evidence and there seems to be even stronger evidence that the change was made by tj or at least that it is in his handwriting boyd declaration of independence 1945 p 22–33  the word “in” was deleted before “rights” tj may have started to write “inherent”4  the word “subject” was changed to “reduce” this however was not an interlineation but was a correction made on the same line a clear evidence that the alteration was made at the time tj wrote out the “rough draught”5  the phrase “to arbitrary power” was changed in a sequence of two alterations to “under absolute despotism” the first alteration being made by tj so that when adams made his copy the phrase read “under absolute power” franklin made the second change substituting “despotism” for “power”6  the phrase “in the legislature” was interlined after the word “representation” this change was probably made in the course of copying the “rough draught” for “in the legislature” occurs at the same point in document i7  the word “alone” was changed to read “only” this change like that indicated in notes 1 10 and 12 was made by expunging or erasing one word while the ink was still wet and overwriting the substituted word thus all three of these changes were probably made by tj in the course of copying the “rough draught”8  the phrase “he has dissolved” was struck out at the beginning of this line it is obvious that tj had started to repeat the preceding sentencea clear evidence that he was copying from an earlier draft boyd declaration of independence 1945 p 269  here an alteration was made by john adams after adams had interlined with a caret the words “after such dissolutions” and had transcribed the document as it stood with these alterations tj then crossed out the words “space of time” and prefixed “time” to adams’ interlineation10  tj originally wrote “fellowsubjects” copying the term from the corresponding passage in the first page of the first draft of the virginia constitution then while the ink was still wet on the “rough draught” he expunged or erased “subjects” and wrote “citizens” over it the fact that he made the same change in document i is evidence that he was using that document as the composition text for this part of the declaration11  the words “determined to keep open a market where men should be bought  sold” were bracketed in the “rough draught” and then interlined at the point indicated adams copied the clause at the same point tj subsequently deleted the brackets crossed out the interlined repetition of the words after “commerce” and thus restored the original reading while therefore the text at this point does not reflect its state at the time the adams copy was written it does give the text in the order in which tj first copied it in the “rough draught” congress of course struck out the entire passage12  tj first wrote the figure “12” and then as in the changes indicated in notes 1 7 and 10 wrote the word “twelve” over it the correction being made in the course of copying13  tj deleted “glory ” before and interlined “ to glory” after “happiness” this alteration was made in the course of copying since the same change was made in document ii14  tj changed “in a separate state” to “separately” in the “rough draught” then altered both that and the passage in document ii to read “apart from them” this was the form which adams copied thus we are able to follow tj here in turning to two alternative readings in the “rough draught” before going back to the text of document ii to record the one that finally satisfied him15  this word was changed to “denounces” in both the “rough draught” and in document ii the adams copy reads “denounces”16  tj struck out “everlasting adieu” in both the “rough draught” and the text of document ii and substituted “eternal separation” which is the reading of the adams copy
