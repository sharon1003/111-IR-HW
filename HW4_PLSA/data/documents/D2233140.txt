print email facebook twitter more analysis bhp billitons south32 spin off will it pay off by business reporter stephen letts updated 4 may 2015 549pm mon 4 may 2015 549pm photo bhp billiton is going to become the slightly less big australian after it spins off south32 tomorrow tim wimborne reutersbhp billiton shareholders running late to the companys dual general meetings in perth and london on wednesday neednt fret the one item on the agenda  to approve spinning off noncore assets into a new company called south32  is basically a done deal indeed under uk listing rules a vote wasnt even required  an inspecie transfer of shares would have got the job done  but the bhp board opted to down the democratic corporate governance path apart from a mugging from uk institutional investors  which overturned the original decision not to have a secondary listing in london  things have gone pretty much to plan for the bhp board the sales pitch that the demerger will create shareholder value by simplifying the worlds biggest diversified miner seems to have been accepted and shareholders will receive one south32 share for every bhp billiton share they own bhp will be stripped back to its core four pillars iron ore copper coal and petroleum with potash held as a fifth future growth option the bundled together second tier assets in south32 will have their own board and a senior management team spilt between australia and south africa bhp argues the south32 assets will thrive by no longer having to compete for capital and love in a bigger corporate family loaded with better prospects another way to look at south32 is that it unravels the very costly 2001 merger of the old big australian bhp and south africas billiton  with the new demerged south32 bits looking remarkably like the old underperforming billiton bits it is also a signal that bhp may now be thinking that bigger isnt always better in mining and scale can also create inefficiencies particularly as the resources boom starts to cool much of the commentary from the big institutional investors has been about not having a reason to vote against the demerger rather than an enthusiastic endorsement of it many older players in the market would probably prefer the opportunity to have a second crack at the 2001 merger vote rather than voting this time around to unscramble the original value destroying decision demergers often create value but not always historically spinoffs have created a fair bit of shareholder value a study by morgan stanley of 20 recent and relevant spinoffs found the demerged companies outperformed the broader market  as measured by the asx200  by 6 per cent in the first 12 months and 17 per cent over two years while its only a very loose guide to what might happen bhps two previous spinoffs  bluescope and arrium formerly one steel  were reasonably successful however there are differences this time around the earlier spinoffs were essentially manufacturers  steelmakers  which had diversified far from the core mining business and needed management with a different focus and skills there has also been some monumental destruction of shareholder value through spinoffs as well ascianos demerger from toll in 2007 is a particularly painful case study of what can go wrong the pair underperformed the market by 40 per cent in the first year and 21 per cent in the second and have never fully recovered despite japan posts recent generous takeover offer for toll asciano was weighed down by 5 billion debt and unhappily had annual interest bills of more than 300 million leading up to the gfc south32s net debt will be far more manageable  around us670 million and gearing of around 5 per cent compared to the core bhp business debt of 243 billion and 25 per cent gearing the bottom line for shareholders is that the benefits will need to outweigh the costs of the deal for it to be a success bhp says the initial transaction cost will be us738 million  around half of which is stamp duty  just to split the company on top of that fairly hefty impost south32 will incur an ongoing us60 million a year cost from moving out of the bhp stable and being a standalone company however bhp argues the advantages of the demerger far outweigh the disadvantages and risks its investor presentation puts productivity gains from the new focus on core assets at us4 billion a year by 2017 while cost savings from a streamlined bhp have been pencilled in at us100 million interestingly south32s foundation chairman is veteran director david crawford who has some experience with demergers having chaired fosters during the fraught spinoff of treasury wine estates one fund manager who preferred to remain anonymous opined if theres someone who knows what can go wrong with a demerger its david crawford not a big valuation triggermorgan stanleys resources team has done its sums and said the south32 spinoff will not be a big valuation trigger but it has potential to add an additional us500 to us1 billion in earnings through cost reductions its bull case is that would be worth around 135 per share to bhp morgan stanley has given south32 a broad valuation range with a midpoint of 265 per share implying a market capitalisation of 85 billion making it an asx top 50 company credit suisse is a fair bit more generous with a market cap of us125 billion which could put it near a spot in the asxs top 20 the south32 assets  primarily mines in australia and south africa with a nickel operation in colombia thrown in for good measure  operate on far skinnier margins than those retained in the core bhp the key earners at current spot prices are alumina aluminium and manganese while its coal the ones bhp didnt want and nickel operations would

to investors that the company is well capitalised and in no need of a big capex spend to drive productivity the focus will be on improving the efficiency and resource conversion of existing assets rather than using the low levels of debt to buy growth from bhps perspective the focus will be on driving its precious and irreplaceable tier one assets however sometimes too much focus can be a difficult thing as one fund manager who has been struggling to understand the demergers value proposition noted bhps capital allocation decisions since the gfc have been appalling along with rio they had a mad rush to grow iron ore production that ultimately shredded profits i cant see why this decision would be any better than that though it probably wont be worse the test of that proposition wont be wednesdays vote or even when the demerged entities started trading separately in two weeks but some time down the track when the actual  not theoretical  costs and benefits can be lined up
