answered copy and paste features between feature classes  vb net arc gis 10question asked by crdale on apr 17 2012 latest reply on may 9 2012 by crdale like • 0 comment • 1hello allim currently in the midst of upgrading a custom tool from 931 executable to 100 esri addin and ive come across two commands esri arc map ui edit copy command and esri arc map ui edit paste command that arent working properly an edit session is started through code features are selected through a query and placed in a feature selection and then the two command names get passed into the following methodpublic shared sub execute cmd arc map by val str uid as stringdescription executes the spcified arc map command button input parameters 1 str uid string representing the specified arc map tools uid dim p doc as esri arc gis framework idocument dim p cmd bars as esri arc gis framework icommand bars dim p item as esri arc gis framework icommand item dim p uid as uidtryp uid  new uidp uid value  str uidp doc  my arc map documentp cmd bars  p doc command barsp item  p cmd bars find p uidp item execute catch ex as exception status log log error ex to stringend try end subthe copy command is copying selected road centerline features from one feature class stored in an sde database and pasting them into an identical copy of the same feature class stored in either a file geodatabase or a personal geodatabase a new database gets created at the beginning of the tool and it is up to the user to select which database he or she wants to use when the code tries to execute these commands i get the following error message no acceptable target available target geometry type must match that of the feature s being pasted this doesnt make sense to me because the geometry of two feature classes is the same since they are both line feature classes i have a couple of hunches 1 the copy and paste functionality has changed between 931 and 10 which is something that ive dealt with before in other upgrades but not quite in this manner from experience when you manually copy a feature in the arc map ui and paste it a dialog box comes up and prompts you to select a target layer to paste to i also tested the copypaste manually between the two feature classes and it worked 2 there may be differences between a feature class in an sde database and one in a personal or file geodatabase does anyone have any ideas on how to either replace these commands or make them work thankschanning edit ive also been experimenting with the editing template functionality and seeing if these need to be accessed for copying and pastingcrdale may 9 2012 1152 amcorrect answer after much brainstorming and headscratching a solution was finally found on how to replace these commands there is another command in arc map called load objects that behaves almost the exact same way as the simple data loader in arc catalog the only difference is that after navigating to the location of the source feature classtable the destination of the data is a layer chosen from the mxd the command also allows you to map fields for loading the interface i used is iobject loader since the schema of the destination feature class that im loading the data into is an exact copy of the source feature class i didnt have to worry about using field mapping objects in code heres the examples i used in order to get the iobject loader load objects method working c example vba example the vba example was pretty easy to change over to vb net and adapt to the variables i was already using in code this thread got a lot of views so i hope it helps people who are also searching for a solutionsee the reply in context no one else had this question visibility arc objects sdk 3852 views last modified on apr 17 2012 951 amtags desktop server gisdevelopers engine arcobjects
