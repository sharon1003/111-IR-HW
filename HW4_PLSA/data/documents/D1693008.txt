human is a complex organisms because humans are made up of trillion of cell and a lot of system and organ  some of the major systems are blood circulatory systems the skeletal system the digestive system the nervous system and the respiratory system most of which are grouped into organ systems that have specialised functionsa better developed brain able to create and learn from experience and endowed with intelligence which enables them to think and reason rationally  humans are unique among earth’s life forms as they have language and thought cells group together in the body to form tissues  nerve cell bone cell epithelial cell form bones to support the body and protect organs type of human cell structure respective function red blood cell white blood cell transports vital food and oxygen biconcave shape to all parts of the body contracts and relaxes to move parts of the body it protects the internal and external parts of the body protects the body from damage by invaders carries messages in the form of electrical impulses around the body muscle cell  if the egg is fertilized it will develop into an embryo  human sperm cell human egg cell ova takes part in fertilization to produce young onestissue a collection of similar cells that group together to perform a specialized function connective tissue there are 4 primary tissue types in the human body epithelial tissue  muscle tissue and nerve tissue in place and protected the inside of the mouth and stomach epithelial tissue serve as membranes lining organs and helping to keep the bodys organs separate some examples of epithelial tissue are the outer layer of the skin and the tissue surrounding the bodys organs epithelial tissue • the cells of epithelial tissue pack tightly together and form continuous sheets that serve as linings in different parts of the body epithelial tissue  some examples of connective tissue include the inner layers of skin  most types of connective tissue contain fibrous strands of the protein collagen that add strength to connective tissue connective tissue adds support and structure to the body cartilage tendons generally speaking bone and fat tissue in addition to these more recognizable forms of connective tissue ligaments blood is also considered a form of connective tissue connective tissue • there are many types of connective tissue in the body connective tissue  muscle tissue contains the specialized proteins actin and myosin that slide past one another and allow movement  muscle tissue • muscle tissue is a specialized tissue that can contract examples of muscle tissue are contained in the muscles throughout your body muscle tissue  these electrical messages are managed by nerve tissue in the brain and transmitted down the spinal cord to the body  nerve tissue • nerve tissue contains two types of cells neurons and glial cells nerve tissue has the ability to generate and conduct electrical signals in the body nerve tissue  organs • organs are the next level of organization in the body even your skin is an organ heart kidneys  an organ is a structure that contains at least two different types of tissue functioning together for a common purpose there are many different organs in the body the liverdermis and subcutaneous layer the skin is composed of three layers the epidermis  the epidermis is the outermost layer of skin the skin is the largest organ in the human body and provides us with an excellent example for explanation purposes• in factthe dermis has many other purposes  in addition to providing support for the skin• it consists of epithelial tissue in which the cells are tightly packed together providing a barrier between the inside of the body and the outside world below the epidermis lies a layer of connective tissue called the dermis it contains nerve tissue that provides feeling in the skin the subcutaneous layer is beneath the dermis and consists mainly of a type of connective tissue called adipose tissue adipose tissue is more commonly known as fat and it helps cushion the skin and provide protection from cold temperatures and it contains muscle tissue that is responsible for giving you goosebumps when you get cold or frightened• the dermis contains blood vessels that nourish skin cells  there are 10 major organ systems in the human body they are the  system organ systems are composed of two or more different organs that work together to provide a common function the endocrine system produces  the skeletal system  protect internal organ and provides body support the lymphatic system  body‘s defenses against infection the reproductive system  for reproduction the muscular system  enables body movement stores and secretes chemical substances known as hormones the nervous system detect stimuli and responds to them digestion absorption the blood circulatory system supplies the cells of the body with the food the respiratory system supplies oxygen and aids removing of carbon dioxide the digestive system  processes food ingestion the excretory system  removes waste products from body transport waste product  the endocrine system  the skeletal system  the lymphatic system  the reproductive system  the muscular system  the nervous system  the blood circulatory system  the respiratory system  the digestive system  the excretory system deriving energy from food protection against injury  these systems can best be understood in terms of the essential functions they serve internal coordination and reproduction human is a complex organism remember that
