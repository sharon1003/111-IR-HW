explanation of the solar system the solar system is the sun and all the objects that orbit around it the sun is orbited by planets asteroids comets and other things it is billions of years old the sun is a star it contains 999 percent of the solar systems mass 1 this means that it has strong gravity the other objects are pulled into orbit around the sun the sun is mostly made out of hydrogen and helium there are eight planets in the solar system from closest to farthest from the sun they are mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune the first four planets are called terrestrial planets they are mostly made of rock and metal and they are mostly solid the last four planets are called gas giants this is because they are much larger than other planets and are mostly made of gas the solar system also contains other things there are asteroids mostly between mars and jupiter further out than neptune there is the kuiper belt and the scattered disc these areas have dwarf planets including pluto there are thousands of very small objects in these areas there are also comets centaurs and there is interplanetary dust six of the planets and three of the dwarf planets are orbited by moons furthermore planetary dust orbits the gas giants many other systems like the solar system have been found each of the billions of stars in the milky way galaxy might have a

formation and evolution of the solar system began 46 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud 2most of the collapsing mass collected in the centre forming the sun while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk of loose dust out of which the planets moons asteroids and other solar system bodies formed this widely accepted model known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th 1700s century by emanuel swedenborg immanuel kant and pierresimon laplace its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy physics geology and planetary science as our knowledge of space has grown the models have been changed to account for the new observations the solar system has evolved considerably since its initial formation many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets while other moons are believed to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets still others as the earth s moon may be the result of giant collisions many collisions between bodies have occurred and have been important to the evolution of the solar system the positions of the planets often shifted and planets have switched places 3 4 this planetary migration is thought to have been responsible for much of the solar systems early evolution earths orbit  change  change sourcethe earths orbit around the sun is nearly a perfect circle but when mapped it is found that the earth moves around the sun in a very slightly oval shaped called an elliptical orbit the other planets in the solar system also circle the sun in slightly elliptical orbits mercury has a more elliptical orbit than the others and some of the smaller objects orbit the sun in very eccentric orbits discovery and exploration  change  change sourcemain article history of astronomy for thousands of years people had no need for a name for the solar system they thought the earth stayed still at the center of everything  geocentrism  although the greek philosopher aristarchus of samos suggested that there was a special order in the sky 5 nicolaus copernicus was the first to develop a mathematical system that described what we now call the solar system this was called a new system of the world in the 17th century galileo galilei johannes kepler and isaac newton began helping people understand physics more clearly people began to accept the idea that the earth is a planet and moves around the sun and that the planets are worlds with the same physical laws that control earth more recently telescopes and space probes have led to discoveries of mountains and craters and seasonal meteorological phenomena such as clouds dust storms and ice caps on the other planets planetary distances not to scale the eight planets  change  change sourcein their order from the sun mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune the planets are the biggest objects that go around sun it took people many years of using telescopes to find the objects that were farthest away new planets might still be found and more small objects are found every year most of the planets have moons that orbit around them just as the planets orbit the sun there are at least 173 of these moons in the solar system dwarf planets  change  change sourcemain article dwarf planet pluto had been called a planet since it was discovered in 1930 but in 2006 astronomers meeting at the international astronomical union decided on the definition of a planet and pluto did not fit instead they defined a new category of dwarf planet into which pluto did fit along with some others these small planets are sometimes called plutinos pluto ceres haumea eris makemake structure  change

with solid surfaces they are made up of mostly rock and metal with a distinct internal structure and a similar size three also have an atmosphere the study of the four planets gives information about

the farther away from this plane a planet orbits the more inclined is its orbit to the ecliptic if you could look at the solar system edge on then all the planets would be orbiting more or less in the
