driver after about 3 weeks maybe a month started driving i worked one day then that night they said i had an issue with my dmv record and as i tried to contact them they would only send me generic messages and no one really reached out to me it’s a shame they are a quick scam company that can’t even be reached by phone and email is auto email i’ll give uber a shot but i highly recommend not even trying with lyft usefulpagesreviewstackedshowmorezerokasey guerra1 review published 31 hours ago lyft likes to steal peoples money lyft likes to steal peoples money i have had charges to my card for rides that arent mine they refuse to refund the money i contacted them multiple times about this and always get the same answer they have a bunch of idiots working there they also dont seem to

published 2 days ago5 cancellation fee lyft overall is good the only thing i hate is that if i see my ride coming to pick me up on the map and then i see it going in the opposite direction i can’t cancel because i will be charged 5 a minute later the app is searching for a new driver i wasted my time watching it go in the wrong direction so i can’t cancel but they’re allowed to cancel for me do drivers get penalized as well why can it be reversed i get 5 because my driver was wrong not fair and a waste of time it happens quite a bit actually usefulpagesreviewstackedshowmorezerojustin donohue1 review published friday march 30 2018poor customer service poor customer service i called lyft to see if i could get some help with apparent connectivity issues that ive had on my windows 10 app as well as the microsoft edge version of the lyft app instead of trying to work with me on how to potentially fix the issues on my laptop the csr just mocked me for not having a smartphone whether i have a smartphone or not has nothing to do with troubleshooting the lyft app for my computer it worked fine when i first started using it so id love to continue using it but every time i try there are issues i didnt call to be mocked i called for assistance his assistance was get a smartphone thats not assistance usefulpagesreviewstackedshowmorezerocharolett marshall2 reviews published friday march 30 2018 updated friday march 30 2018lyft makes fraud credit card charges i had never heard of this company until my credit card was charged for 3 rides on the same day 1500 for 2 of those charges  the third was for 1503 this was done at the beginning of march so my bank closed that account and gave me a new number i just checked and some how i got another fraud charge from yesterday in the amount of 1003 again my bank is closing that account and again giving me another one what a hassle from a company i have never heard of or ever used and based on what has happened i will never use

steal peoples money period im going to delete this app right now and share my experience with everyone i know very very very bad experience today for the very first time i used lyft but as i’m first time user not very familiar with an interface after ordering the ride as soon as it says your ride is confirmed because i couldn’t see the charges for the ride i canceled the ride literally less than 15seconds after i ordered one but the drive called me that he’s there and charged me 5 cancelation fee which i believe i didn’t deserve to be charged for as a first time user was such a bad experience first of all how do you expect me to order a ride without knowing the fee for it and why it didn’t cancel my ride when i press cancel ride dont even let me start with the customer service after all emails and they gave me the cancelation fee charge as a credit to my account which expires in 10days is it a joke or what in order to get my money back i should deal order a ride with lyft again

for lyft as a driver and if youre not 5 minutes away from a person they will cancel their ride from you and its exhausting and thats why i decided to quit lyft driving and only occasionally will i pick up lyft while im an uber driver as well uber is very convenient because their platform once a request is taken by uber driver usually the people were picking will wait approximately 10 minutes or more which saves the driver gas  time and money and left is just a waste of time and a horrible company to work for up on uber will stay online with you for 5 to 10 minutes as youre heading there

traveled with lyft it was the worst experience i have ever had in my life vicki in the red dodge caliber 538xib was the woman that picked me up the lyft app took her to a wrong destination that i didnt recognize she verified that the address she was at was not the one i gave her but nevertheless she rudely kicked me out of the car and left me stranded i explained to her that i was just visiting the us and i completely did not know where to start in the wired place she told me she doesnt care i had to get out coz she had another client waiting and it aint her fault that the app map was wrong i was so terrified i tell u i felt like the woman was going to beat me up if i didnt get out i wonder if lyft does not screen its drivers coz this is the highlight level of uninvited cruelty i have ever seen even when i begged her to at least drop me off in the nearest shopping center on her way she told me she aint my slave that i paid lyt for the ride no her i believe she used that term because am an african lady and she is white but i didnt even get into that her tone was so cruel like one more second in her car and she wd beat the hell out of me so i was abused dumped and lost with a dead phone i had to walk 1and half hours to get home while asking strangers for directions on their google maps u know how hard that can be very terrifying experience my eyes still bring tears as i write this it was so so painful but watch out for vicki in a red dodge caliber 538xib could add her picture but no option usefulpagesreviewstackedshowmorezerocarly wags1 review published sunday march 25 2018 updated sunday march 25 2018lyft vs taxi lyft wants to be considered in the transportation business yet they cancel rides when it takes over 15 minutes for the driver to arrive and then they send someone new we literally waited 15 minutes our driver was 2 minutes away when they canceled our ride at 1030 pm and the next available driver was yet another 15 minutes out thank goodness a reliable taxi was within our reach i reached out to customer service and was given 10 for the awful experience when really they should have given us 40 because thats how much the taxi ride cost us first impressions really do matter and due to their awful one we have deleted the app and leaving reviews for others who may be traveling and think lyft is good solution its not

assistance while lyft can be an affordable and quick transport method in large cities it is next to useless in smaller cities also lyft is not regulation e compliant they refuse to remove a payment method once they have been informed that they are no longer authorized to retainuse the payment method additonally they make their cancellation process as difficult to complete as possible in order to

learn more  published wednesday march 21 2018there are a few things i believe that…there are a few things i believe that need to be improved for example when we accept a ride we know where we are going to pick up a passanger but we dont know where we are dropping them off i’ve had to cancel a few times because its far from where i want to be or i am near the wnd of my shift also i’ve experienced an emergency restroom stop when i had a 45 minute drive i feel like there should be some button to pause the ride or request a bathroom stop in the event that there are emergencies i feel like that app should incorporate something similar like the fitbit if we drive for more than lets say 23 hours a message should pop up and ask us if we have had a breakrestroom break for the destination mode i feel like that still needs work when i set my home destination it often reroutes me to other locations that are not in route to my homedestination i feel like we should have a little control of where we want to drive for example lets say that we want to drive all of sf down to south sf but not into hwy 80 or past the airport i wish there was a way that we can circle or pin the locations where we would like to drive usefulpagesreviewstackedshowmorezeroruben vidal2 reviews ruben vidal was invited to write this review by lyft learn more  verified order ruben vidal was
