imagine that something is being missed if you have subjective symptoms of nasal obstruction i am not sure that a rhinoplasty is what you need for functional improvement it is more likely that septal surgery or turbinate surgery would address your breathing concerns nasal performance is a complicated interplay of tissues within and outside the nose in some patients a very small problem can lead to significant symptoms patients of different ethnic backgrounds and nasal architecture will breathe through different areas or levels within the nose itself a small bony floor deflection may be a problem for one patient but irrelevant for another dynamic nostril or nasal sidwall collapse due to weak nasal cartilages can also produce poor nasal breathing this will only be seen if the physician examines the outside of your nose while breathing if your obstruction alternates sides then turbinate issues are likely contributing if your breathing problems are mostly at night then it is again likely a turbinate problem a phenomenon called rhinitis of recombancy external nasal deviation usually results in internal deviations of functional significance prostate blood pressure contraceptive and thyroid medications can cause nasal obstruction as well as oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy low thyroid levels can also be a contributing factor without seeing your nose it is impossible for me to know exactly what your problem is however here are some anatomical reasons in likely order for nasal obstruction that may be missed by a doctor that does not specialize in treating these problems slight septal deviation or dislocation in an eloquent area of the nose such as the nasal valve bony septal deviation that may only be seen with nasal endoscopic examination using a small camerainferior turbinate hypertrophy nasal sidewall collapse adenoid hypertrophy a growth in the nose such as a polyp choanal atresia where the opening in the back of the nose never formedand many more causes i would recommend examination and consultation with a nasal specialist such as an ent or facial plastic surgeon specializing in functional rhinoplasty and septoplasty corrections richard w westreich mdmanhattan facial plastic surgeon69 reviews rhinoplasty isnt always the answer to nasal obstruction nasal obstruction is a complicated issue that is all too often ignored or attributed to “allergies” “sinuses” or to a “deviated septum” here at profiles we often have patients who present to us who have been previously evaluated by other physicians who were unable to determine the cause of nasal obstruction we always begin by explaining that it is important to understand that nasal obstruction is a subjective sensation and that it occasionally does not correlate with anatomic problems in other words some people can have a slightly deviated septum and complain profusely of their difficulty breathing while other people are completely obstructed on one side of the nose without ever even realizing they have a problem so if you have trouble breathing through your nose it is important to let us do a thorough evaluation it is true that oftentimes nasal obstruction is due to a deviated septum where the midline cartilage andor bone that separates the two sides of your nose is crooked nasal allergies whether seasonal or yearround“sinus problems” this diagnosis is unfortunately all too commonly applied to patients without proper evaluation there are other very important causes of nasal obstruction that are often overlooked on examination these include nasal valve obstruction which refers to excessive narrowing of the nasal valve area the narrowest part of your nose internally this can happen during normal breathing during sleep or only during deep breathing such as while exercising an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon will be able to identify this cause during a thorough examination the good news is that these and many other causes of poor breathing are treatable nasal obstruction is a complex problem and there are numerous possible explanations with even more possible solutions we recognize how nagging this problem can be and we understand how complex the solution is the important thing for you is to find the doctor who will take the time to find out what your source of obstruction is and more importantly knows how to correct this problem for further info we recommend you go to our modern rhinoplasty online book and read further on functional rhinoplasty peyman solieman mdbeverly hills facial plastic surgeon3
