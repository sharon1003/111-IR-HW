does mike trouts mvp win answer whos most valuableplay nov 17 2016sam miller espncom facebook twitter facebook messenger pinterest emailprintcomment in 2010 after years of rewarding the pitcher with the most wins cy young voters gave the award to felix hernandez the mariners ace had gone 1312 and the vote was celebrated by many as a victory not just for the king but for the voting process in general the tyranny of wins was dead the baseball writers association of america whose members vote on the award had leapt into the modern ways of evaluating players our november tradition of tearing apart the downballot selections of baseball writers was mercifully over and then the next six american league cy youngs went to the league leader in pitcher wins including rick porcello this week just goes to show you  something on thursday mike trout won his second al mvp award this is the outcome i had hoped for the best player won the award that most closely corresponds to the question who was the best player its the outcome that the bbwaa had avoided in three of the previous four seasons when trout was by wins above replacement and in all three of the most prominent public models of it the best player in baseball but the runnerup in mvp voting the lone year he won  2014  has been the exception that proves the rule as trout led the league in rbis and played on a division champion he was the best player in baseball too but it didnt feel like he won that one because he was mike trout you fools mike trout can afford to smile  hes not a runnerup again in american league mvp voting this time around elsagetty images in the same way that felix hernandezs cy young was supposed to mean something mike trout finally winning an mvp award without any of the usual crutches of default mvp voting will seem to mean something resist that conclusion this is not about the voters and it is not about us its about mike trout the greatest player youve ever seen and his very good year and a decision made by 30 men and women that is worth celebrating because it might not happen again voters have been struggling with what an mvp is since just about the very beginning the mvp award was launched in a series of fits and starts under various aegises and rules just over a century ago by the mid1920s sportssection readers could already count on columnists making a case for some player and struggling with the ambiguity in the name of the award itself in 1927 bob ray of the los angeles times took a shot at defining it through the lens of one candidate gehrig is a good guess all right but dont entirely overlook signor antonio lazzeri who also cavorts on the yankee infield lazzeris allaround play has been one of the features of the season and his ability to fill in at any of the infield berths is one reason why the yankees are so far out in front the attributes that ray laid out included utility lazzeri played a bunch of positions after teammates went down clutchness lazzeri has rapped most of his four baggers when they meant the ball game one of them coming with the bases full marketable italianness lazzeri packs in the italian fans wherever the yankees play and outstanding defense fielding has been so phenomenal that eastern critics are pronouncing him another lajoie in 1932 grantland rice argued that the underheralded second baseman charlie gehringer deserved consideration one of the most selfeffacing stars in baseball charlie gehringer is the punch in the tigers attack and hes being nominated as the most valuable player in the junior league what has gehringer got that permits him to be mentioned in the same breath with lou gehrig and babe ruth of the yanks and joe cronin of the senators who have been rated the key men of the american league what indeed rice mentions the knack for timely hitting caring less about winning the batting championship than hoisting the detroit team into a preferred position superbly graceful play around the keystone sack playing a demanding infield position and being smart in scouting opponents in 1928 the times made the case for burleigh grimes who was an underdog to jim bottomley of the frontrunning cardinals there is no question that burleighs presence on their team has inspired the pirates in the spring when all the pitchers with the exception of grimes were going bad the team appeared listless and downhearted there were games when they were worse than the hopeless phillies now they look like one of the best teams in the league they never would have threatened to climb out of the second division if battling burleigh hadnt been plugging for them what a manfrom the beginning there was an admirable effort put into understanding the entirety of the ballplayers contribution and valuing those things that the ballplayers and ballclubs themselves valued there was also arguably a tendency for writers to talk themselves into some terrible positions such as tony lazzeri for mvp hitting 373474765 as gehrig did in 1927 or 364469749 as jimmie foxx did in 1932 might also help us define value each won the mvp award but presumably ray and rice didnt discount those gaudy slash lines they just aimed to make the case that a successful ballplayer often does things that didnt as they say show up in the box score editors picks how mike trout earned al mvp on a sub500 team some thought mookie betts would win but trouts great season for the 7488 angels earned him mvp how did he deliver the most value to get the award mookie betts had an age23 season for the um ages the only players to post a higher war at age 23 than the red sox right fielder willie mays ted williams ty cobb eddie collins and cal ripken jr the best of trout and bryant in 2016kris bryant and mike trout are the fourth pair of players under 25 years and under to win mvpwhat the award was never meant to be was a leaderboard sort indeed it was the very opposite of a leaderboard sort the first mvp award was designed to replace the batting crown which had been turned into a farce on the final day of the 1910 season when nap lajoie was allowed to bunt his way past ty cobb thanks to shall we say an anticobb bias among players as the bill james historical abstract puts it after this it was realized that it was not advisable to make such an award contingent directly on player statistics a principle still recognized today instead the chalmers company decided to base its award  the automobile upon a poll of sportswriters the ambiguity about who should win the award a concept so abstract that it would itself inspire a century of debate is not then an accident its part of what makes the award fun part of what makes it memorable part of why players care about winning it more than they care about leading the league in war or any other stat we have a basic faith in the idea of a group of people coming together with their individual perspectives on the world and voting their consciences we believe that this is how some large truth emerges that an algorithm or a scientist cant engineer by one way of considering the voting there is no such thing as a bad vote that is submitted in good faith the cost of this faith of course is that well hate the results much of the time  especially now that we have an actual leaderboard that attempts to measure value itself and concluding that mike trout is the most valuable baseball player in the world should be one of the easiest decisions an mvp voter gets to make in his or her life it is certainly about time that trout won a second award there is no credible argument that would suggest trout isnt the best player in his league or that he wasnt this year over his fiveyear career he has led the al in wins above replacement five times you go to a different site than i do for your wins above replacement no problem he leads the al in all five years regardless of whether youre looking at baseballreference fan graphs or baseball prospectus his cumulative war on baseballreference is nearly two full mike trout seasons better than the next best major leaguer in that time period robinson cano his cumulative war in those five years is greater than manny machado and anthony rizzo combined its as great as jose altuve yoenis cespedes and eric hosmer combined its as great as justin upton chris davis kendrys morales and mark trumbo combined only two players in postintegration history  willie mays and barry bonds  have ever produced a better fiveyear run than trout has produced in his first fiveyear run he is through age 24 the greatest player in baseball history were not talking about a great player a generational player another in a line of establishment superstars were talking about something that history has never seen and its happening right now in front of us every day  and the continued runnerup finishes suggested we were missing it mike trouts performance should have us thinking about how many records he might shatter not just how many mvp awards he already deserves rick osentoskiusa today sports his 2016 season was as good as any of the previous four he matched a career high for ops set new ones for walks and onbase percentage remembered after two quiet baserunning seasons that hes a toptier base stealer and by some advanced metrics had the best defensive season he has had since he was a rookie his 106 war on baseballreference is nearly equal to his best ever and is a mark that only seven other human beings have accomplished since integration what will mike trout accomplish in his career very little is off the table through age 24 he has the seventhmost home runs ever with exactly twice as many as barry bonds had and 28 more than hank aaron did at that age hes 13th in hits with a 400hit head start on pete rose hes seventh in runs 15th in runs batted in sixth in total bases fifth in extrabase hits fourth in times on base he is building a career that might demolish records and define our memories of an entire generation of baseball you would like to think well have no fuzz on those memories but the truth is that these awards go a long way to how we define and remember a career big round numbers do too but those numbers are affected by so many things that are hard to account for in our heads a halfcentury later the runscoring environment of the era the ballpark he played in for instance but more than that in 50 years who even knows which stats well look at or what well value in a player theres a pretty good chance well be measuring modern players in the future using data that dont even exist yet for trout and that we cant go back to collect retroactively what we will have what will be permanent are these annual assessments by the bbwaa and in a just world mike trout just a couple months past his 25th birthday would already have five mvp awards you would care to see that two at least is better than one its a victory worth celebrating but im skeptical its a victory any broader than that late last month the players voted on sporting news mlb player of the year their winner was jose altuve mookie betts finished second followed by david ortiz kris bryant daniel murphy and finally mike trout five players on contending teams who all helped their team win or stay close to a division crown ahead of trout whose team played for nothing that has been one of trouts challenges in winning the mvp award before this year he hasnt been playing on postseason teams and some years for some players some voters decide thats important but thats the mvp award notice whats missing in the sporting news mlb player of the year award name the word value the voters for this award decided five other major leaguers played better than mike trout because they just didnt care enough to get it right this years mvp voters did care enough to get it right or at least the definition they chose for most valuable player corresponded to my definition those voters though total 30 there are more than 700 active bbwaa members in a sample of less than 5 percent of members by an extremely thin margin voters chose mike trout its hardly a radical realignment of values scramble the members up have them vote again and its quite possible trout would have finished second or third again this is ok trouts legacy is bolstered by the hardware but it is not so fragile as to depend on these votes honus wagners career almost entirely predated the mvp award and he never won one babe ruth played in an era when players were allowed to win it only once and so he won it only once willie mays led national league hitters in war 10 times but won only two awards are any of these careers underrecognized by history do you know anybody who doesnt know what babe ruth represented can you find anybody who lived through willie mays career who would tell you that he was underappreciated even then trout might deserve 15 of these in his career he might win two and he might win a dozen when he wins one we toast to the greatest player alive when he loses one we still toast to the greatest player alive sponsored headlines comments
