understanding low platelets by melanie haiken health journalist quick summary think of platelets in the same way youd think of cornstarch or flour when you mix it in a sauce or stew and its easy to see why theyre so important theyre the clotting factors that make blood thicken and harden without them bleeding becomes unstoppable and suddenly every minor cut or injury becomes dangerous why does cancer make platelet counts drop in most cases its not the cancer itself but the treatment that causes low platelets  chemotherapy can make platelet counts fall because it targets cells that grow rapidly tumor cells grow and divide quickly but so do the cells in the bone marrow that produce red blood cells and platelets radiation can also cause a low platelet count also called thrombocytopenia especially radiation to the pelvic area because theres a higher proportion of bone marrow in the pelvic bones but some cancers particularly lymphoma and leukemia can lower platelet production if they spread to the bone marrow can low platelet counts be prevented there are medications called cell growth factors that can be given along with chemo or radiation to prevent blood counts from dropping the growth factor that works for low platelets is called oprelvekin brand name neumega theres a risk of side effects with this medication though so the doctor will decide whether to prescribe it based on her assessment of the patients risk of developing a low platelet count the doctor will also consider whether he has heart problems because neumegas side effects include fluid retention and heart palpitations  both of which can worsen heart conditions other side effects include diarrhea and other digestive issues more ways to understand low platelets how long will it take platelet counts to rise again thats the big question and the answer is probably within three to four weeks doctors cant make an accurate prediction because platelet count depends on many factors including the type of cancer type of treatment  particularly the type and dosage of chemo  and a patients general state of health one thing to keep in mind is that a patients platelet count generally wont drop immediately after chemo it usually takes a week or two this is because chemo doesnt kill off the platelets already in the bloodstream which are mature and arent dividing rapidly it kills off the cells forming in the marrow and therefore theres a delayed response with the lowest platelet counts called the nadir usually occurring seven to 14 days after chemo after that a patients body will begin regenerating platelets at a rate of approximately 10 percent a day platelets have a life span of eight to ten days so on any given day approximately 10 percent are being lost and replaced but some types of cancer and some types of trea tment suppress the production of platelets so the rebuilding process can be much slower more ways to understand low platelets how low do platelet counts need to go before treatment is necessary the answer to this question in most cases depends on whether the patient is having bleeding problems because most doctors will treat the symptoms rather than looking only at the platelet count a normal platelet count is between 150000 and 450000 per cubic millimeter but most people wont experience serious bleeding problems until their platelet count drops below 50000 and some will function fine with a platelet count lower than that doctors try not to treat to a number because everyone is different and reacts differently says andrew putnam director of the palliative care program at lombardi comprehensive cancer center and georgetown university if you arent having problems with bleeding then the doctor will probably let it go lower and see if the counts recover what symptoms of low platelet count should i watch for bruising and bleeding that wont stop are the two main signs of a low platelet count a patient may have frequent nosebleeds or a nosebleed that wont stop women who are still menstruating need to watch out for heavy flow that seems like it wont let up less common symptoms of a low platelet count are blood in the stool or black tarlike stools blood in the urine or a skin rash of pinpricksize red dots if there havent been any problems with excessive bruising or bleeding the doctor will probably wait to treat it but there are still protective
