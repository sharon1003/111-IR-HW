chapter 5 bacterial fermentationscontents  previous  next51 what are bacteria bacteria are a large group of unicellular or multicellular organisms lacking chlorophyll with a simple nucleus multiplying rapidly by simple fission some species developing a highly resistant resting spore phase some species reproduce sexually and some are motile in shape they are spherical rodlike spiral or filamentous they occur in air water soil rotting organic material animals and plants saprophytic forms are more numerous than parasites a few forms are autotrophic walker 1988 there are several bacterial families present in foods the majority of which are concerned with food spoilage the important role of bacteria in the fermentation of foods is often overlooked52 lactic acid bacteria the lactic acid bacteria are a group of gram positive bacteria nonrespiring nonspore forming cocci or rods which produce lactic acid as the major end product of the fermentation of carbohydrates they are the most important bacteria in desirable food fermentations being responsible for the fermentation of sour dough bread sorghum beer all fermented milks cassava to produce gari and fufu and most pickled fermented vegetables historically bacteria from the genera lactobacillus leuconostoc pediococcus and streptococcus are the main species involved several more have been identified but play a minor role in lactic fermentations lactic acid bacteria were recently reviewed by axelsson 1998 lactic acid bacteria carry out their reactions  the conversion of carbohydrate to lactic acid plus carbon dioxide and other organic acids  without the need for oxygen they are described as microaerophilic as they do not utilise oxygen because of this the changes that they effect do not cause drastic changes in the composition of the food some of the family are homofermentative that is they only produce lactic acid while others are heterofermentative and produce lactic acid plus other volatile compounds and small amounts of alcohol lactobacillus acidophilus l bulgaricus l plantarum l caret l pentoaceticus l brevis and l thermophilus are examples of lactic acidproducing bacteria involved in food fermentations all species of lactic acid bacteria have their own particular reactions and niches but overall l plantarum – a homofermenter produces high acidity in all vegetable fermentations and plays the major role all lactic acid producers are nonmotile gram positive rods that need complex carbohydrate substrates as a source of energy the lactic acid they produce is effective in inhibiting the growth of other bacteria that may decompose or spoil the food because the whole group are referred to as ‘lactic acid bacteria’ it might appear that the reactions they carry out are very simple with the production of one substrate this is far from the truth the lactic acid bacteria are a diverse group of organisms with a diverse metabolic capacity this diversity makes them very adaptable to a range of conditions and is largely responsible for their success in acid food fermentations despite their complexity the whole basis of lactic acid fermentation centres on the ability of lactic acid bacteria to produce acid which then inhibits the growth of other nondesirable organisms all lactic acid producers are microaerophilic that is they require small amounts of oxygen to function species of the genera streptococcus and leuconostoc produce the least acid next are the heterofermentative species of lactobacillus which produce intermediate amounts of acid followed by the pediococcus and lastly the homofermenters of the lactobacillu s species which produce the most acid homofermenters convert sugars primarily to lactic acid while heterofermenters produce about 50 lactic acid plus 25 acetic acid and ethyl alcohol and 25 carbon dioxide these other compounds are important as they impart particular tastes and aromas to the final product the heterofermentative lactobacilli produce mannitol and some species also produce dextran leuconostoc mesenteroides is a bacterium associated with the sauerkraut and pickle fermentations this organism initiates the desirable lactic acid fermentation in these products it differs from other lactic acid species in that it can tolerate fairly high concentrations of salt and sugar up to 50 sugar l mesenteroides initiates growth in vegetables more rapidly over a range of temperatures and salt concentrations than any other lactic acid bacteria it produces carbon dioxide and acids which rapidly lower the p h and inhibit the development of undesirable microorganisms the carbon dioxide produced replaces the oxygen making the environment anaerobic and suitable for the growth of subsequent species of lactobacillus removal of oxygen also helps to preserve the colour of vegetables and stabilises any ascorbic acid that is present organisms from the gram positive propionibacteriaceae family are responsible for the flavour and texture of some fermented foods especially swiss cheese where they are responsible for the formation of eyes or holes in the cheese these bacteria break down lactic acid into acetic and propionic acids and carbon dioxide several other bacteria for instance leuconostoc citrovorum l dextranicum streptococcus lactis s cremis  liquefaciens and brevibacterium species are important in the fermentation of dairy products they are not discussed in detail in this manuscript521 lactic acid fermentation the lactic acid bacteria belong to two main groups – the homofermenters and the heterofermenters the pathways of lactic acid production differ for the two homofermenters produce mainly lactic acid via the glycolytic embden–meyerhof pathway heterofermenters produce lactic acid plus appreciable amounts of ethanol acetate and carbon dioxide via the 6phosphoglucanatephosphoketolase pathway the glycolytic pathway is used by all lactic acid bacteria except leuconostocs group iii lactobacilli oenococci and weissellas normal conditions required for this pathway are excess sugar and limited oxygen axelsson 1998 gives an indepth account of the biochemical pathways for both homo and heterofermenters homolactic fermentation the fermentation of 1 mole of glucose yields two moles of lactic acidc 6 h 12 o 6 2 ch 3 chohcoohglucose lactic acid heterolactic fermentation the

beuchat 199553 acetic acid bacteria a second group of bacteria of importance in food fermentations are the acetic acid producers from the acetobacter species acetobacter are important in the production of vinegar acetic acid from fruit juices and alcohols the same reaction also occurs in wines oxygen permitting where the acetobacter can cause undesirable changes – the oxidation of alcohol to acetic acid this produces a vinegary offtaste in the wine the most desirable action of acetic acid bacteria is in the production of vinegar the vinegar process is essentially a two stage process where yeasts convert sugars into alcohol followed by acetobacter which oxidise alcohol to acetic acid for this reason the products of acetobacter fermentation are discussed in more detail in chapter 7 on mixed fermentations531 acetic acid fermentation acetobacter convert alcohol to acetic acid in the presence of excess oxygen oxidation of alcohol to acetic acid and water the oxidation of one mole of ethanol yields one mole each of acetic acid and waterc 2 h 5 oh  o 2ch 3 cooh  h 2 oalcohol acetic acid water54 bacteria of alkaline fermentations a third group of bacteria are those which bring about alkaline fermentations  the bacillus species of note are bacillus subtilis b licheniformis and b pumilius bacillus subtilis is the dominant species causing the hydrolysis of protein to amino acids and peptides and releasing ammonia which increases the alkalinity and makes the substrate unsuitable for the growth of spoilage organisms alkaline fermentations are more common with protein rich foods such as soybeans and other legumes although there are a few examples utilising plant seeds for example water melon seeds  ogiri in nigeria and sesame seeds  ogirisaro in sierra leone and others where coconut and leaf proteins are the substrates indonesian semayi and sudanese kawal respectively although the range of products of alkaline fermentation does not match those brought about by acid fermentations they are important in that they provide protein rich low cost condiments from leaves seeds and beans which contribute to the diet of millions of people in africa and asia steinkraus presents a comprehensive review of the acid alkaline and alcoholic fermentations from around the world which the reader is referred to for further information steinkraus 199655 conditions required for bacterial fermentations microorganisms vary in their optimal p h requirements for growth most bacteria favour conditions with a near neutral p h 7 the varied p h requirements of different groups of microorganisms is used to good effect in fermented foods where successions of microorganisms take over from each other as the p h of the environment changes certain bacteria are acid tolerant and will survive at reduced p h levels notable acidtolerant bacteria include the lactobacillus and streptococcus species which play a role in the fermentation of dairy and vegetable products oxygen requirements vary from species to species the lactic acid bacteria are described as microaerophilic as they carry out their reactions with very little oxygen the acetic acid bacteria however require oxygen to oxidise alcohol to acetic acid in vinegar production oxygen has to be made available for the production of acetic acid whereas with wine it is essential to exclude oxygen to prevent oxidation of the alcohol and spoilage of the wine551 temperature different bacteria can tolerate different temperatures which provides enormous scope for a range of fermentations while most bacteria have a temperature optimum of between 20 to 30ºc there are some the thermophiles which prefer higher temperatures 50 to 55ºc and those with colder temperature optima 15 to 20ºc most lactic acid bacteria work best at temperatures of 18 to 22ºc the leuconostoc species which initiate fermentation have an optimum of 18 to 22ºc temperatures above 22ºc favour the lactobacillus species552 salt concentration lactic acid bacteria tolerate high salt concentrations the salt tolerance gives them an advantage over other less tolerant species and allows the lactic acid fermenters to begin metabolism which produces acid which further inhibits the growth of nondesirable organisms leuconostoc is noted for its high salt tolerance and for this reason initiates the majority of lactic acid fermentations553 water activity in general bacteria require a fairly high water activity 09 or higher to survive there are a few species which can tolerate water activities lower than this but usually the yeasts and fungi will predominate on foods with a lower water activity554 hydrogen ion concentration p hthe optimum p h for most bacteria is near the neutral point p h 70 certain bacteria are acid tolerant and will survive at reduced p h levels notable acidtolerant bacteria include the lactobacillus and streptococcus species which play a role in the fermentation of dairy and vegetable products555 oxygen availability some of the fermentative bacteria are anaerobes while others require oxygen for their metabolic activities some lactobacilli in particular are microaerophilic that is they grow in the presence of reduced amounts of atmospheric oxygen in aerobic fermentations the amount of oxygen present is one of the limiting factors it determines the type and amount of biological product obtained the amount of substrate consumed and the energy released from the reaction acetobacter require oxygen for the oxidation of alcohol to acetic acid556 nutrients all bacteria require a source of nutrients for metabolism the fermentative bacteria require carbohydrates – either simple sugars such as glucose and fructose or complex carbohydrates such as starch or cellulose the energy requirements of microorganisms are very high limiting the amount of substrate available can check their growth56 principles of lactic acid fermentation sauerkraut is one example of an acid fermentation of vegetables the name sauerkraut literally translates as acid cabbage the sauerkraut process can be applied to any other suitable type of vegetable product because of the importance of this product in the german diet the process has received substantial research in order to commercialise and standardise production as a result the process and the contributing microorganisms are known intimately other less well known fermented fruits and vegetables have received less research attention therefore little is known of the exact process it is safe to assume however that the acid fermentation of vegetables is based on this process lactic acid fermentations are carried out under three basic types of condition– dry salted brined and nonsalted salting provides a suitable environment for lactic acid bacteria to grow which impart the acid flavour to the vegetable salt for pickling for pickling any variety of common salt is suitable as long as it is pure impurities or additives can cause problems salt with chemicals to reduce caking should not be used as they make the brine cloudy salt with lime impurities can reduce the acidity of the final product and reduce the shelf life of the product salt with iron impurities can result in the blackening of the vegetables magnesium impurities impart a bitter taste carbonates can result in pickles with a soft texture lal siddappa and tandon 1986561 dry salted fermented vegetables with dry salting the vegetable is treated with dry salt the salt extracts the juice from the vegetable and creates the brine the vegetable is prepared washed in potable cold water and drained for every 100 kg of vegetables 3 kg of salt is needed the vegetables are placed in a layer of about 25cm depth in the fermenting container a barrel or keg salt is sprinkled over the vegetables another layer of vegetables is added and more salt added this is repeated until the container is three quarters full a cloth is placed above the vegetables and a weight added to compress the vegetables and assist the formation of a brine which takes about 24 hours as soon as the brine is formed fermentation starts and bubbles of carbon dioxide begin to appear fermentation takes between one and four weeks depending on the ambient temperature fermentation is complete when no more bubbles appear after which time the pickle can be packaged in a variety of mixtures these can be vinegar and spices or oil and spices lal et al 1986562 the ‘sauerkraut’ process lactic acid bacteria are the primary group of organisms involved in sauerkraut fermentation they can be divided into three groups according to their types and end products leuconostoc mesenteroides an acid and gas producing coccus lactobacillus plantarum and bacilli that produce acid and a small amount of gas l cucumeris lactobacillus pentoaceticus acid and gas producing bacilli  l brevisin addition to the desirable bacteria there are a range of undesirable microorganisms present on cabbage and other vegetable material which can interfere with the sauerkraut process if allowed to multiply unchecked the quality of the final product depends largely on how well the undesirable organisms are controlled during the fermentation process some of the typical spoilage organisms utilise the protein as an energy source producing unpleasant odours and flavours the fermentation process shredded cabbage or other suitable vegetables are placed in a jar and salt is added mechanical pressure is applied to the cabbage to expel the juice which contains fermentable sugars and other nutrients suitable for microbial activity the first microorganisms to start acting are the gasproducing cocci l mesenteroides these microbes produce acids when the acidity reaches 025 to 03 calculated as lactic acid these bacteria slow down and begin to die off although their enzymes continue to function the activity initiated by the l mesenteroides is continued by the lactobacilli l plantarum and l cucumeris until an acidity level of 15 to 2 is attained the high salt concentration and low temperature inhibit these bacteria to some extent finally l pentoaceticus continues the fermentation bringing the acidity to 2 to 25 thus completing the fermentation the end products of a normal kraut fermentation are lactic acid along with smaller amounts of acetic and propionic acids a mixture of gases of which carbon dioxide is the principal gas small amounts of alcohol and a mixture of aromatic esters the acids in combination with alcohol form esters which contribute to the characteristic flavour of sauerkraut the acidity helps to control the growth of spoilage and putrefactive organisms and contributes to the extended shelf life of the product changes in the sequence of desirable bacteria or indeed the presence of undesirable bacteria alter the taste and quality of the product effects of temperature on sauerkraut process the optimum temperature for sauerkraut fermentation is around 21ºc a variation of just a few degrees from this temperature alters the activity of the microbial process and affects the quality of the final product therefore temperature control is one of the most important factors in the sauerkraut process a temperature of 18º to 22º c is most desirable for initiating fermentation since this is the optimum temperature range for the growth and metabolism of l mesenteroides temperatures above 22ºc favour the growth of lactobacillus species effects of salt on the sauerkraut process salt plays an important role in initiating the sauerkraut process and affects the quality of the final product the addition of too much salt may inhibit the desirable bacteria although it may contribute to the firmness of the kraut the principle function of salt is to withdraw juice from the cabbage or other vegetable thus making a more favourable environment for development of the desired bacteria generally salt is added to a final concentration of 20 to 25 at this concentration lactobacilli are slightly inhibited but cocci are not affected unfortunately this concentration of salt has a greater inhibitory effect against the desirable organisms than against those responsible for spoilage the spoilage organisms can tolerate salt concentrations up to between 5 and 7 therefore it is the acidic environment created by the lactobacilli that keep the spoilage bacteria at bay rather than the addition of salt in the manufacture of sauerkraut dry salt is added at the rate if 1 to 15 kg per 50kg cabbage 2 to 3 the use of salt brines is not recommended in sauerkraut making but is common in vegetables that have a low water content it is essential to use pure salt since salts with added alkali may neutralise the acid use of starter cultures in order to produce sauerkraut of consistent quality starter cultures similar to those used in the dairy industry have been recommended not only do starter cultures ensure consistency between batches they speed up the fermentation process as there is no time lag while the relevant microflora colonise the sample because the starter cultures used are acidic they also inhibit the undesirable microorganisms it is possible to add starters traditionally used for milk fermentation such as streptococcus lactis without adverse effect on final quality because these organisms only survive for a short time long enough to initiate the acidification process in the kraut medium they do not disturb the natural sequence of microorganisms on the other hand if leuconostoc mesenteroides is added in the early stages it gives a good flavour to the final product but alters the sequence of subsequent bacterial growth and results in a product that is incompletely fermented if gas producing rods for example l pentoaceticus are added to the sauerkraut this disturbs the balance between acetic and lactic acids  more acetic acid and less lactic acid are produced than normal  and the fermentation never reaches completion if lactic acid nongas producing rods l cucumeris are used as a starter again the kraut is not completely fermented and the resulting product is bitter and more susceptible to spoilage by yeasts it is possible to use the juice from a previous kraut fermentation as a starter culture for subsequent fermentations the efficacy of using old juice depends largely on the types of organisms present in the juice and its acidity if the starter juice has an acidity of 03 or more it results in a poor quality kraut this is because the cocci which would normally initiate fermentation are suppressed by the high acidity leaving the bacilli with sole responsibility for fermentation if the starter juice has an acidity of 025 or less the kraut produced is normal but there do not appear to be any beneficial effects of adding this juice often the use of old juice produces a sauerkraut which has a softer texture than normal spoilage and defects in the sauerkraut process the majority of spoilage in sauerkraut is due to aerobic soil microorganisms which break down the protein and produce undesirable flavour and texture changes the growth of these aerobes can easily be inhibited by a normal fermentation soft kraut can result from many conditions such as large amounts of air poor salting procedure and varying temperatures whenever the normal sequence of bacterial growth is altered or disturbed it usually results in a soft product it is the lactobacilli which seem to have a greater ability than the cocci to break down cabbage tissues which are responsible for the softening high temperatures and a reduced salt content favour the growth of lactobacilli which are sensitive to higher concentrations of salt the usual concentration of salt used in sauerkraut production slightly inhibits the lactobacilli but has no effect on the cocci if the salt content is too low initially the lactobacilli grow too rapidly at the beginning and upset the normal sequence of fermentation another problem encountered is the production of dark coloured sauerkraut this is caused by spoilage organisms during the fermentation process several conditions favour the growth of spoilage organisms for example an uneven distribution of salt tends to inhibit the desirable organisms while at the same time allowing the undesirable salt tolerant organisms to flourish an insufficient level of juice to cover the kraut during the fermentation allows undesirable aerobic bacteria and yeasts to grow on the surface of the kraut causing off flavours and discoloration if the fermentation temperature is too high this also encourages the growth of undesirable microflora which results in a darkened colour pink kraut is a spoilage problem it is caused by a group of yeasts which produce an intense red pigment in the juice and on the surface of the cabbage it is caused by an uneven distribution of or an excessive concentration of salt both of which allow the yeast to multiply if conditions are optimal for normal fermentation these spoilage yeasts are suppressed563 brine salted fermented vegetables brine is used for vegetables which inherently contain less moisture a brine solution is prepared by dissolving salt in water a 15 to 20 salt solution fermentation takes place well in a brine of about 20 salometer as a general guide a fresh egg floats in a 10 brine solution kordylas 1990 properly brined vegetables will keep well in vinegar for a long time the duration of brining is important for the overall keeping qualities the vegetable is immersed in the brine and allowed to ferment the strong brine solution draws sugar and water out of the vegetable which decreases the salt concentration it is crucial that the salt concentration does not fall below 12 otherwise conditions do not allow for fermentation to achieve this extra salt is added periodically to the brine mixture once the vegetables have been brined and the container sealed there is a rapid development of microorganisms in the brine the natural controls which affect the microbial populations of the fermenting vegetables include the concentration of salt and temperature of the brine the availability of fermentable materials and the numbers and types of microorganisms present at the start of fermentation the rapidity of the fermentation is correlated with the concentration of salt in the brine and its temperature most vegetables can be fermented at 125 o to 20 o salometer salt if so the microbial sequence of lactic acid bacteria generally follows the classical sauerkraut fermentation described by pederson 1979 at higher salt levels of up to about 40 o salometer the sequence is skewed towards the development of a homofermentation dominated by lactobacillus plantarum at the highest concentrations of salt about 60 o salometer the lactic fermentation ceases to function and if any acid is detected during brine storage it is acetic acid presumably produced by acidforming yeasts which are still active at this concentration of salt vaughn 1985 brine salted fermentation of vegetables picklespickled cucumbers are another fermented product that has been studied in detail and the process is known the fermentation process is very similar to the sauerkraut process only brine is used instead of dry salt the washed cucumbers are placed in large tanks and salt brine 15 to 20 is added the cucumbers are submerged in the brine ensuring that none float on the surface  this is essential to prevent spoilage the strong brine draws the sugar and water out of the cucumbers which simultaneously reduces the salinity of the solution in order to maintain a salt solution so that fermentation can take place more salt has to be added to the brine solution if the concentration of salt falls below 12 it will result in spoilage of the pickles through putrefaction and softening a few days after the cucumbers have been placed in the brine the fermentation process begins the process generates heat which causes the brine to boil rapidly acids are also produced as a result of the fermentation during fermentation visible changes take place which are important in judging the progress of the process the colour of the cucumber surface changes from bright green to a dark olive green as acids interact with the chlorophyll the interior of the cucumber changes from white to a waxy translucent shade as air is forced out of the cells the specific gravity of the cucumbers also increases as a result of the gradual absorption of salt and they begin to sink in the brine rather than floating on the surface microbes involved in the fermentation process as with the sauerkraut process the gram positive coccus  leuconostoc mesenteroides predominates in the first stages of pickle fermentation this species is more resistant to temperature changes and tolerates higher salt concentration than the subsequent species as fermentation proceeds and the acidity increases lactobacilli start to take over from the cocci the active stage of fermentation continues for between 10 to 30 days depending upon the temperature of the fermentation the optimum temperature for l cucumeris is 29 to 32ºc during the fermentative period the acidity increases to about 2 and the strong acid producing types of bacteria reach their maximum growth if sugar or acetic acid is added to the fermenting mixture during this time it increases the production of acid problems in pickles the production of excessive amounts of acid during the fermentation results in shrivelling of the pickles possibly due to overactivity of the l mesenteroides species if the brine is stirred it may introduce air which makes conditions more favourable for the growth of spoilage bacteria in general if the pickles are well covered with brine the salt concentration is maintained and the temperature is at an optimum it should be quite simple to produce good quality pickles564 non salted lactic acid fermented vegetables some vegetables are fermented by lactic acid bacteria without the prior addition of salt or brine examples of nonsalted products include gundruk consumed in nepal sinki and other wilted fermented leaves the detoxification of cassava through fermentation includes an acid fermentation during which time the cyanogenic glycosides are hydrolysed to liberate the toxic cyanide gas the fermentation process relies on the rapid colonisation of the food by lactic acid producing bacteria which lower the p h and make the environment unsuitable for the growth of spoilage organisms oxygen is also excluded as the lactobacilli favour an anaerobic atmosphere restriction of oxygen ensures that yeasts do not grow for the production of sinki fresh radish roots are harvested washed and wilted by sundrying for one to two days they are then shredded rewashed and packed tightly into an earthenware or glass jar which is sealed and left to ferment the optimum fermentation time is twelve days at 30ºc sinki fermentation is initiated by l fermentum and l brevis followed by l plantarum during fermentation the p h drops from 67 to 33 after fermentation the radish substrate is sundried to a moisture level of about 21 for consumption sinki is rinsed in water for two minutes squeezed to remove the excess water and fried with salt tomato onion and green chilli the fried mixture is then boiled in rice water and served hot as soup along with the main meal steinkraus 1996 pit fermentations south pacific pit fermentations are an ancient method of preserving starchy vegetables without the addition of salt the raw materials undergo an acid fermentation within the pit to produce a paste with good keeping qualities pit fermentations are also used in other parts of the world – for example in ethiopia where the false banana  ensete ventricosum is fermented in a pit to produce a pulp known as kocho foods preserved in pits can last for years without deterioration therefore pits provide a good reliable cheap means of storage root crops and bananas are peeled before being placed in the pit while breadfruit are scraped and pierced food is left to ferment for three to six weeks after which time it becomes soft has a strong odour and a pastelike consistency during fermentation carbon dioxide builds up in the pit creating an anaerobic atmosphere as a result of bacterial activity the temperature rises much higher than the ambient temperature the p h of the fruit within the pit decreases from 67 to 37 within about four weeks inoculation of the fruit in the pit with lactic acid bacteria greatly speeds up the process the fermented paste can be left in the pit and removed as required usually it is removed and replaced with a second batch of fresh food to ferment the fermented food is washed and fibrous material removed it is then dried in the sun for several hours to remove the volatile odours and pounded into a paste grated coconut or coconut cream and sugar may be added and the mixture is wrapped in banana leaves and either baked or boiled steinkraus 199657 principles of acetic acid fermentation the main desirable fermentation carried out by acetic acid bacteria is the production of vinegar vinegar literally translated as sour wine is one of the oldest products of fermentation used by man it can be made from almost any fermentable carbohydrate source for example fruits vegetables syrups and wine whatever the raw material used the fermentation process follows a definite sequence the basic requirement for vinegar production is a raw material that will undergo an alcoholic fermentation apples pears grapes honey syrups cereals hydrolysed starches beer and wine are all ideal substrates for the production of vinegar the best raw materials are cider and wine which are widely used in europe and the united states to produce a high quality product it is essential that the raw material is mature clean and in good condition571 microbes involved in the vinegar process the production of vinegar depends on a mixed fermentation which involves both yeasts and bacteria the fermentation is usually initiated by yeasts which break down glucose into ethyl alcohol with the liberation of carbon dioxide gas following on from the yeasts acetobacter oxidise the alcohol to acetic acid and water yeast reaction c 6 h 12 o 62c 2 h 5 oh  2co 2glucose yeastethyl alcohol carbon dioxide bacterial reaction c 2 h 5 oh  o 2ch 3 cooh  h 2 oalcohol acetic acid water the yeasts and bacteria exist together in a form known as commensalism the acetobacter are dependent upon the yeasts to produce an easily oxidisable substance ethyl alcohol it is not possible to produce vinegar by the action of one type of microorganism alone for a good fermentation it is essential to have an alcohol concentration of 10 to 13 if the alcohol content is much higher the alcohol is incompletely oxidised to acetic acid if it is lower than 13 there is a loss of vinegar because the esters and acetic acid are oxidised in addition to acetic acid other organic acids are formed during the fermentation which become esterified and contribute to the characteristic odour flavour and colour of the vinegar acetaldehyde is an intermediate product in the transformation of the reducing sugar in fruit juice to acetic acid or vinegar oxygen is required for the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetic acid in general the yield of acetic acid from glucose is approximately 60 that is three parts of glucose yield two parts acetic acid572 microorganisms involved in the fermentation of vinegar the organisms involved in vinegar production usually grow at the top of the substrate forming a jelly like mass this mass is known as mother of vinegar the mother is composed of both acetobacter and yeasts which work together the principal bacteria are acetobacter acetic a xylinum and a ascendens the main yeasts are saccharomyces ellipsoideus and s cerevisiae it is important to maintain an acidic environment to suppress the growth of undesirable organisms and to encourage the presence of desirable acetic acid producing bacteria it is common practice to add 10 to 25 by volume of strong vinegar to the alcoholic substrate in order to attain a desirable fermentation the alcoholic fermentation of sugars should be completed before the solution is acidified because any remaining sugar will not be converted to alcohol after the acetic acid is added incomplete fermentation of the juice results in a weak product the acetic acid strength of good vinegar should be approximately 6573 fermentation methods small scale production vinegar can be made at home at the small scale by introducing oxygen into barrels of wine or cider and allowing fermentation to occur spontaneously this process is not very rigorously controlled and often results in a poor quality product the orleans process the orleans process is one of the oldest and well known methods for the production of vinegar it is a slow continuous process which originated in france high grade vinegar is used as a starter culture to which wine is added at weekly intervals the vinegar is fermented in large 200 litre capacity barrels approximately 65 to 70 litres of high grade vinegar is added to the barrel along with 15 litres of wine after one week a further 10 to 15 litres of wine are added and this is repeated at weekly intervals after about four weeks vinegar can be withdrawn from the barrel 10 to 15 litres per week as more wine is added to replace the vinegar one of the problems encountered with this method is that of how to add more liquid to the barrel without disturbing the floating bacterial mat this can be overcome by using a glass tube which reaches to the bottom of the barrel additional liquid is poured in through the tube and therefore does not disturb the bacteria wood shavings are sometimes added to the fermenting barrel to help support the bacterial mat quick vinegar method because the orleans process is slow other methods have been adapted to try and speed up the process the german method is one such method it uses a generator which is an upright tank filled with beechwood shavings and fitted with devices which allow the alcoholic solution to trickle down through the shavings in which the acetic acid bacteria are living the tank is not allowed to fill as that would exclude oxygen which is necessary for the fermentation near the bottom of the generator are holes which allow air to be drawn in the air rises through the generator and is used by the acetic acid bacteria to oxidise the alcohol this oxidisation also releases considerable amounts of heat which must be controlled to avoid causing damage to the bacteria problems in vinegar production many of the problems of vinegar production are concerned with the presence of nematodes mites flies and other insects these pests can be controlled by adherence to good hygiene and pasteurisation of the vinegar problems associated with the fermentative process include the presence of a whitish film on the surface of the vinegar this is sometimes called mycoderma vini and is composed of yeastlike organisms which grow aerobically and oxidise the carbon containing compounds to carbon dioxide and water they also alter the flavour and alcohol content of the vinegar this problem can however be controlled by adding one part vinegar to three parts of the alcoholic solution or by storing the alcoholic liquid in filled closed containers contents  previous  next
