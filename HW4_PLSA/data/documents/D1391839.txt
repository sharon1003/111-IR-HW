as gestation is the time during which one or more offspring develops inside a woman 4 a multiple pregnancy involves more than one offspring such as with twins 12 pregnancy can occur by sexual intercourse or assisted reproductive technology 6childbirth typically occurs around 40 weeks from the last menstrual period lmp 4 5 this is just over nine months where each month averages 29½ days 4 5 when measured from conception it is about 38 weeks 5 an embryo is the developing offspring during the first eight weeks following conception after which the term fetus is used until birth 5 symptoms of early pregnancy may include missed periods tender breasts nausea and vomiting hunger and frequent urination 1 pregnancy may be confirmed with a pregnancy test 7pregnancy is typically divided into three trimesters 4 the first trimester is from week one through 12 and includes conception 4 conception is when the sperm fertilizes the egg the fertilized egg then travels down the fallopian tube and attaches to the inside of the uterus where it begins to form the embryo and placenta 4 during the first trimester the possibility of miscarriage natural death of embryo or fetus is at its highest 2 the second trimester is from week 13 through 28 4 around the middle of the second trimester movement of the fetus may be felt 4 at 28 weeks more than 90 of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided with highquality medical care 4 the third trimester is from 29 weeks through 40 weeks 4prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes 9 prenatal care may include taking extra folic acid avoiding drugs and alcohol regular exercise blood tests and regular physical examinations 9complications of pregnancy may include disorders of high blood pressure gestational diabetes irondeficiency anemia and severe nausea and vomiting among others 3 term pregnancy is 37 to 41 weeks with early term being 37 and 38 weeks full term 39 and 40 weeks and late term 41 weeks 4 after 41 weeks it is known as post term 4 babies born before 37 weeks are preterm and are at higher risk of health problems such as cerebral palsy 4 delivery before 39 weeks by labor induction or caesarean section is not recommended unless required for other medical reasons 13about 213 million pregnancies occurred in 2012 of which 190 million were in the developing world and 23 million were in the developed world 10 the number of pregnancies in women ages 15 to 44 is 133 per 1000 women 10 about 10 to 15 of recognized pregnancies end in miscarriage 2 in 2013 complications of pregnancy resulted in 293000 deaths down from 377000 deaths in 1990 11 common causes include maternal bleeding complications of abortion high blood pressure of pregnancy maternal sepsis and obstructed labor 11 globally 40 of pregnancies are unplanned 10

external links terminology william hunter anatomia uteri humani gravidi tabulis illustrata 1774associated terms for pregnancy are gravid and parous gravidus and gravid come from the latin for heavy and a pregnant female is sometimes referred to as a gravida 15 gravidity is a term used to describe the number of times that a female has been pregnant similarly the term parity is used for the number of times that a female carries a pregnancy to a viable stage 16 twins and other multiple births are counted as one pregnancy and birth a woman who has never been pregnant is referred to as a nulligravida a woman who is or has been only pregnant for the first time is referred to as a primigravida 17 and a woman in subsequent pregnancies as a multigravida or as multiparous 15 18 therefore during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as gravida 2 para 1 and upon live delivery as gravida 2 para 2 inprogress pregnancies abortions miscarriages and or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number in the case of a multiple birth the gravida number and parity value are increased by one only women who have never carried a pregnancy achieving more than 20 weeks of gestation age are referred to as nulliparous 19the terms preterm and postterm have largely replaced earlier terms of premature and postmature preterm and postterm are defined above whereas premature and postmature have historical meaning and relate more to the infants size and state of development rather than to the stage of pregnancy 20 21signs and symptoms main article symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy melasma pigment changes to the face due to pregnancy the symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy are those presentations and conditions that result from pregnancy but do not significantly interfere with activities of daily living or pose a threat to the health of the mother or baby this is in contrast to pregnancy complications sometimes a symptom that is considered a discomfort can be considered a complication when it is more severe for example nausea  morning sickness can be a discomfort but if in combination with significant vomiting it causes a waterelectrolyte imbalance it is a complication known as hyperemesis gravidarum common symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy include tiredness constipation pelvic girdle pain back pain braxton hicks contractions occasional irregular and often painless contractions that occur several times per day edema swelling common complaint in advancing pregnancy caused by compression of the inferior vena cava and pelvic veins by the uterus leads to increased hydrostatic pressure in lower extremities increased urinary frequency a common complaint caused by increased intravascular volume elevated glomerular filtration rate and compression of the bladder by the expanding uterus urinary tract infection 22varicose veins common complaint caused by relaxation of the venous smooth muscle and increased intravascular pressure haemorrhoids piles swollen veins at or inside the anal area caused by impaired venous return straining associated with constipation or increased intraabdominal pressure in later pregnancy 23regurgitation heartburn and nausea stretch marks breast tenderness is common during the first trimester and is more common in women who are pregnant at a young age 24in addition pregnancy may result in pregnancy complication such as deep vein thrombosis or worsening of an intercurrent disease in pregnancy chronology the chronology of pregnancy is unless otherwise specified generally given as gestational age where the starting point is the womans last normal menstrual period lmp or the corresponding age of the gestation as estimated by a more accurate method if available sometimes timing may also use the fertilization age which is the age of the embryo start of gestational age main article gestational age according to american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists the main methods to calculate gestational age are 25directly calculating the days since the beginning of the last menstrual period early obstetric ultrasound comparing the size of an embryo or fetus to that of a reference group of pregnancies of known gestational age such as calculated from last menstrual periods and using the mean gestational age of other embryos or fetuses of the same size if the gestational age as calculated from an early ultrasound is contradictory to the one calculated directly from the last menstrual period it is still the one from the early ultrasound that is used for the rest of the pregnancy 25in case of in vitro fertilization calculating days since oocyte retrieval or coincubation and adding 14 days 26estimation of due date distribution of gestational age at childbirth among singleton live births given both when gestational age is estimated by first trimester ultrasound and directly by last menstrual period 27 roughly 80 of births occur between 37 and 41 weeks of gestational age main article estimated date of confinement due date estimation basically follows two steps determination of which time point is to be used as origin for gestational age as described in section above adding the estimated gestational age at childbirth to the above time point childbirth on average occurs at a gestational age of 280 days 40 weeks which is therefore often used as a standard estimation for individual pregnancies 28 however alternative durations as well as more individualized methods have also been suggested naegeles rule is a standard way of calculating the due date for a pregnancy when assuming a gestational age of 280 days at childbirth the rule estimates the expected date of delivery edd by adding a year subtracting three months and adding seven days to the origin of gestational age alternatively there are mobile apps which essentially always give consistent estimations compared to each other and correct for leap year while pregnancy wheels made of paper can differ from each other by 7 days and generally do not correct for leap year 29furthermore actual childbirth has only a certain probability of occurring within the limits of the estimated due date a study of singleton live births came to the result that childbirth has a standard deviation of 14 days when gestational age is estimated by first trimester ultrasound and 16 days when estimated directly by last menstrual period 27physiology timeline of pregnancy by gestational age initiation see also human fertilization fertilization and implantation in humans through an interplay of hormones that includes follicle stimulating hormone that stimulates folliculogenesis and oogenesis creates a mature egg cell the female gamete fertilization is the event where the egg cell fuses with the male gamete spermatozoon after the point of fertilization the fused product of the female and male gamete is referred to as a zygote or fertilized egg the fusion of male and female gametes usually occurs following the act of sexual intercourse pregnancy rates for sexual intercourse are highest during the menstrual cycle time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation 30 fertilization can also occur by assisted reproductive technology such as artificial insemination and in vitro fertilisation fertilization conception is sometimes used as the initiation of pregnancy with the derived age being termed fertilization age fertilization usually occurs about two weeks before the next expected menstrual period a third point in time is also considered by some people to be the true beginning of a pregnancy this is time of implantation when the future fetus attaches to the lining of the uterus this is about a week to ten days after fertilization 31 in this model during the time between conception and implantation the future fetus exists but the woman is not considered pregnant development of embryo and fetus main articles prenatal development human embryogenesis and fetus the initial stages of human embryogenesis the sperm and the egg cell which has been released from one of the females two ovaries unite in one of the two fallopian tubes the fertilized egg known as a zygote then moves toward the uterus a journey that can take up to a week to complete cell division begins approximately 24 to 36 hours after the male and female cells unite cell division continues at a rapid rate and the cells then develop into what is known as a blastocyst the blastocyst arrives at the uterus and attaches to the uterine wall a process known as implantation the development of the mass of cells that will become the infant is called embryogenesis during the first approximately ten weeks of gestation during this time cells begin to differentiate into the various body systems the basic outlines of the organ body and nervous systems are established by the end of the embryonic stage the beginnings of features such as fingers eyes mouth and ears become visible also during this time there is development of structures important to the support of the embryo including the placenta and umbilical cord the placenta connects the developing embryo to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake waste elimination and gas exchange via the mothers blood supply the umbilical cord is the connecting cord from the embryo or fetus to the placenta after about ten weeks of gestational age the embryo becomes known as a fetus at the beginning of the fetal stage the risk of miscarriage decreases sharply 32 at this stage a fetus is about 30 mm 12 inches in length the heartbeat is seen via ultrasound and the fetus makes involuntary motions 33 during continued fetal development the early body systems and structures that were established in the embryonic stage continue to develop sex organs begin to appear during the third month of gestation the fetus continues to grow in both weight and length although the majority of the physical growth occurs in the last weeks of pregnancy electrical brain activity is first detected between the fifth and sixth week of gestation it is considered primitive neural activity rather than the beginning of conscious thought synapses begin forming at 17 weeks and begin to multiply quickly at week 28 until 3 to 4 months after birth 34embryo at 4 weeks after fertilization gestational age of 6 weeks fetus at 8 weeks after fertilization gestational age of 10 weeks fetus at 18 weeks after fertilization gestational age of 20 weeks fetus at 38 weeks after fertilization gestational age of 40 weeks relative size in 1st month simplified illustrationrelative size in 3rd month simplified illustrationrelative size in 5th month simplified illustrationrelative size in 9th month simplified illustrationmaternal changes main article maternal physiological changes in pregnancy breast changes as seen during pregnancy the areolae are larger and darker during pregnancy the woman undergoes many physiological changes which are entirely normal including behavioral cardiovascular hematologic metabolic renal and respiratory changes increases in blood sugar breathing and cardiac output are all required levels of progesterone and oestrogens rise continually throughout pregnancy suppressing the hypothalamic axis and therefore also the menstrual cycle the fetus is genetically different from the woman and can be viewed as an unusually successful allograft 35 the main reason for this success is increased immune tolerance during pregnancy 36 immune tolerance is the concept that the body is able to not mount an immune system response against certain triggers 35pregnancy is typically broken into three periods or trimesters each of about three months 37 38 each trimester is defined as 14 weeks for a total duration of 42 weeks although the average duration of pregnancy is 40 weeks 39 while there are no hard and fast rules these distinctions are useful in describing the changes that take place over time first trimester the uterus as it changes in size over the duration of the trimesters minute ventilation increases by 40 in the first trimester 40 the womb will grow to the size of a lemon by eight weeks many symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy like nausea and tender breasts appear in the first trimester 41second trimester by the end of the second trimester the expanding uterus has created a visible baby bump although the breasts have been developing internally since the beginning of the pregnancy most of the visible changes appear after this point weeks 13 to 28 of the pregnancy are called the second trimester most women feel more energized in this period and begin to put on weight as the symptoms of morning sickness subside and eventually fade away the uterus the muscular organ that holds the developing fetus can expand up to 20 times its normal size during pregnancy although the fetus begins to move during the first trimester it is not until the second trimester that movement often referred to as  quickening  can be felt this typically happens in the fourth month more specifically in the 20th to 21st week or by the 19th week if the woman has been pregnant before it is common for some women not to feel the fetus move until much later during the second trimester most women begin to wear maternity clothes third trimester the uterus expands making up a larger and larger portion of the womans abdomen at left anterior view with months labeled at right lateral view labeling the last 4 weeks during the final stages of gestation before childbirth the fetus and uterus will drop to a lower position final weight gain takes place which is the most weight gain throughout the pregnancy the womans abdomen will transform in shape as it drops due to the fetus turning in a downward position ready for birth during the second trimester the womans abdomen would have been upright whereas in the third trimester it will drop down low the fetus moves regularly and is felt by the woman fetal movement can become strong and be disruptive to the woman the womans navel will sometimes become convex popping out due to the expanding abdomen head engagement where the fetal head descends into cephalic presentation relieves pressure on the upper abdomen with renewed ease in breathing it also severely reduces bladder capacity and increases pressure on the pelvic floor and the rectum it is also during the third trimester that maternal activity and sleep positions may affect fetal development due to restricted blood flow for instance the enlarged uterus may impede blood flow by compressing the vena cava when lying flat which is relieved by lying on the left side 42childbirth main article childbirth childbirth referred to as labor and delivery in the medical field is the process whereby an infant is born 43a woman is considered to be in labour when she begins experiencing regular uterine contractions accompanied by changes of her cervix – primarily effacement and dilation while childbirth is widely experienced as painful some women do report painless labours while others find that concentrating on the birth helps to quicken labour and lessen the sensations most births are successful vaginal births but sometimes complications arise and a woman may undergo a cesarean section during the time immediately after birth both the mother and the baby are hormonally cued to bond the mother through the release of oxytocin a hormone also released during breastfeeding studies show that skintoskin contact between a mother and her newborn immediately after birth is beneficial for both the mother and baby a review done by the world health organization found that skintoskin contact between mothers and babies after birth reduces crying improves mother–infant interaction and helps mothers to breastfeed successfully they recommend that neonates be allowed to bond with the mother during their first two hours after birth the period that they tend to be more alert than in the following hours of early life 44childbirth maturity stages further information preterm birth and postterm pregnancy stages of pregnancy termstage starts ends preterm 45  at 37 weeks early term 46 37 weeks 39 weeks full term 46 39 weeks 41 weeks late term 46 41 weeks 42 weeks postterm 46 42 weeks in the ideal childbirth labor begins on its own when a woman is at term 47 pregnancy is considered at term when gestation has lasted between 37 and 42 weeks 46events before completion of 37 weeks are considered preterm 45 preterm birth is associated with a range of complications and should be avoided if possible 48sometimes if a womans water breaks or she has contractions before 39 weeks birth is unavoidable 46 however spontaneous birth after 37 weeks is considered term and is not associated with the same risks of a preterm birth 43 planned birth before 39 weeks by caesarean section or labor induction although at term results in an increased risk of complications 49 this is from factors including underdeveloped lungs of newborns infection due to underdeveloped immune system feeding problems due to underdeveloped brain and jaundice from underdeveloped liver 50babies born between 39 and 41 weeks gestation have better outcomes than babies born either before or after this range 46 this special time period is called full term 46 whenever possible waiting for labor to begin on its own in this time period is best for the health of the mother and baby 47 the decision to perform an induction must be made after weighing the risks and benefits but is safer after 39 weeks 47events after 42 weeks are considered postterm 46 when a pregnancy exceeds 42 weeks the risk of complications for both the woman and the fetus increases significantly 51 52 therefore in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy obstetricians usually prefer to induce labour at some stage between 41 and 42 weeks 53postnatal period main article postnatal the postnatal period also referred to as the puerperium begins immediately after delivery and extends for about six weeks 43 during this period the mothers body begins the return to prepregnancy conditions that includes changes in hormone levels and uterus size 43diagnosis the beginning of pregnancy may be detected either based on symptoms by the woman herself or by using pregnancy tests however an important condition with serious health implications that is quite common is the denial of pregnancy by the pregnant woman about one in 475 denials will last until around the 20th week of pregnancy the proportion of cases of denial persisting until delivery is about 1 in 2500 54 conversely some nonpregnant women have a very strong belief that they are pregnant along with some of the physical changes this condition is known as a false pregnancy 55physical signs further information symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy linea nigra in a woman at 22 weeks pregnant most pregnant women experience a number of symptoms 56 which can signify pregnancy a number of early medical signs are associated with pregnancy 57 58 these signs includethe presence of human chorionic gonadotropin h cg in the blood and urinemissed menstrual periodimplantation bleeding that occurs at implantation of the embryo in the uterus during the third or fourth week after last menstrual periodincreased basal body temperature sustained for over 2 weeks after ovulation chadwicks sign darkening of the cervix vagina and vulvagoodells sign softening of the vaginal portion of the cervixhegars sign softening of the uterus isthmuspigmentation of the linea alba – linea nigra darkening of the skin in a midline of the abdomen caused by hyperpigmentation resulting from hormonal changes usually appearing around the middle of pregnancy 57 58darkening of the nipples and areolas due to an increase in hormones 59biomarkers further information pregnancy test pregnancy detection can be accomplished using one or more various pregnancy tests 60 which detect hormones generated by the newly formed placenta serving as biomarkers of pregnancy 61 blood and urine tests can detect pregnancy 12 days after implantation 62 blood pregnancy tests are more sensitive than urine tests giving fewer false negatives 63 home pregnancy tests are urine tests and normally detect a pregnancy 12 to 15 days after fertilization 64 a quantitative blood test can determine approximately the date the embryo was conceived because hcg doubles every 36 to 48 hours 43 a single test of progesterone levels can also help determine how likely a fetus will survive in those with a threatened miscarriage bleeding in early pregnancy 65ultrasound main article obstetric ultrasonography obstetric ultrasonography can detect fetal abnormalities detect multiple pregnancies and improve gestational dating at 24 weeks 66 the resultant estimated gestational age and due date of the fetus are slightly more accurate than methods based on last menstrual period 67 ultrasound is used to measure the nuchal fold in order to screen for downs syndrome 68management flowchart showing the recommended weight limits for lifting at work during pregnancy as a function of lifting frequency weeks of gestation and the position of the lifted object relative to the lifters body 69prenatal care main articles prenatal care and preconception counseling preconception counseling is care that is provided to a woman and or couple to discuss conception pregnancy current health issues and recommendations for the period before pregnancy 70prenatal medical care is the medical and nursing care recommended for women during pregnancy time intervals and exact goals of each visit differ by country 71 women who are high risk have better outcomes if they are seen regularly and frequently by a medical professional than women who are low risk 72 a woman can be labeled as high risk for different reasons including previous complications in pregnancy complications in the current pregnancy current medical diseases or social issues 73 74the aim of good prenatal care is prevention early identification and treatment of any medical complications 75 a basic prenatal visit consists of measurement of blood pressure fundal height weight and fetal heart rate checking for symptoms of labor and guidance for what to expect next 70nutrition main article nutrition and pregnancy nutrition during pregnancy is important to ensure healthy growth of the fetus 76 nutrition during pregnancy is different from the nonpregnant state 76 there are increased energy requirements and specific micronutrient requirements 76 women benefit from education to encourage a balanced energy and protein intake during pregnancy 77 some women may need professional medical advice if their diet is affected by medical conditions food allergies or specific religious ethical beliefs 78adequate periconceptional time before and right after conception folic acid also called folate or vitamin b 9 intake has been shown to decrease the risk of fetal neural tube defects such as spina bifida 79 the neural tube develops during the first 28 days of pregnancy a urine pregnancy test is not usually positive until 14 days postconception explaining the necessity to guarantee adequate folate intake before conception 64 80 folate is abundant in green leafy vegetables legumes and citrus 81 in the united states and canada most wheat products flour noodles are fortified with folic acid 82dha omega3 is a major structural fatty acid in the brain and retina and is naturally found in breast milk 83 it is important for the woman to consume adequate amounts of dha during pregnancy and while nursing to support her wellbeing and the health of her infant 83 developing infants cannot produce dha efficiently and must receive this vital nutrient from the woman through the placenta during pregnancy and in breast milk after birth 84several micronutrients are important for the health of the developing fetus especially in areas of the world where insufficient nutrition is common 85 women living in low and middle income countries are suggested to take multiple micronutrient supplements containing iron and folic acid 85 these supplements have been shown to improve birth outcomes in developing countries but do not have an effect on perinatal mortality 85 86 adequate intake of folic acid and iron is often recommended 87 88 in developed areas such as western europe and the united states certain nutrients such as vitamin d and calcium required for bone development may also require supplementation 89 90 91 vitamin e supplementation has not been shown to improve birth outcomes 92 zinc supplementation has been associated with a decrease in preterm birth but it is unclear whether it is causative 93 daily iron supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anemia 94 studies of routine daily iron supplementation for pregnant women found improvement in blood iron levels without a clear clinical benefit 95 the nutritional needs for women carrying twins or triplets are higher than those of women carrying one baby 96women are counseled to avoid certain foods because of the possibility of contamination with bacteria or parasites that can cause illness 97 careful washing of fruits and raw vegetables may remove these pathogens as may thoroughly cooking leftovers meat or processed meat 98 unpasteurized dairy and deli meats may contain listeria which can cause neonatal meningitis stillbirth and miscarriage 99 pregnant women are also more prone to salmonella infections can be in eggs and poultry which should be thoroughly cooked 100 cat feces and undercooked meats may contain the parasite toxoplasma gondii and can cause toxoplasmosis 98 practicing good hygiene in the kitchen can reduce these risks 101women are also counseled to eat seafood in moderation and to eliminate seafood known to be high in mercury because of the risk of birth defects 100 pregnant women are counseled to consume caffeine in moderation because large amounts of caffeine are associated with miscarriage 43 however the relationship between caffeine birthweight and preterm birth is unclear 102weight gain the amount of healthy weight gain during a pregnancy varies 103 weight gain is related to the weight of the baby the placenta extra circulatory fluid larger tissues and fat and protein stores 76 most needed weight gain occurs later in pregnancy 104the institute of medicine recommends an overall pregnancy weight gain for those of normal weight  body mass index of 185–249 of 113–159 kg 25–35 pounds having a singleton pregnancy 105 women who are underweight bmi of less than 185 should gain between 127–18 kg 28–40 lbs while those who are overweight bmi of 25–299 are advised to gain between 68–113 kg 15–25 lbs and those who are obese bmi30 should gain between 5–9 kg 11–20 lbs 106 these values reference the expectations for a term pregnancy during pregnancy insufficient or excessive weight gain can compromise the health of the mother and fetus 104 the most effective intervention for weight gain in underweight women is not clear 104 being or becoming overweight in pregnancy increases the risk of complications for mother and fetus including cesarean section gestational hypertension preeclampsia macrosomia and shoulder dystocia 103 excessive weight gain can make losing weight after the pregnancy difficult 103 107around 50 of women of childbearing age in developed countries like the united kingdom are overweight or obese before pregnancy 107 diet modification is the most effective way to reduce weight gain and associated risks in pregnancy 107 a diet that has foods with a low glycemic index may help prevent the onset of gestational diabetes 108medication main article pharmaceutical drugs in pregnancy drugs used during pregnancy can have temporary or permanent effects on the fetus 109 anything including drugs that can cause permanent deformities in the fetus are labeled as teratogens 110 in the u s drugs were classified into categories a b c d and x based on the food and drug administration fda rating system to provide therapeutic guidance based on potential benefits and fetal risks 111 drugs including some multivitamins that have demonstrated no fetal risks after controlled studies in humans are classified as category a 109 on the other hand drugs like thalidomide with proven fetal risks that outweigh all benefits are classified as category x 109recreational drugs the use of recreational drugs in pregnancy can cause various pregnancy complications 43ethanol during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder 43 studies have shown that light to moderate drinking during pregnancy might not pose a risk to the fetus although no amount of alcohol during pregnancy can be guaranteed to be absolutely safe 112tobacco smoking during pregnancy can cause a wide range of behavioral neurological and physical difficulties 113 smoking during pregnancy causes twice the risk of premature rupture of membranes placental abruption and placenta previa 114 smoking is associated with 30 higher odds of preterm birth 115prenatal cocaine exposure is associated with premature birth birth defects and attention deficit disorder 43prenatal methamphetamine exposure can cause premature birth and congenital abnormalities 116 shortterm neonatal outcomes show small deficits in infant neurobehavioral function and growth restriction 117 longterm effects in terms of impaired brain development may also be caused by methamphetamine use 116cannabis in pregnancy has been shown to be teratogenic in large doses in animals but has not shown any teratogenic effects in humans 43exposure to toxins a video describing research on n95 respirator use during advanced pregnancy intrauterine exposure to environmental toxins in pregnancy has the potential to cause adverse effects on the development of the embryo  fetus and to cause pregnancy complications 43 air pollution has been associated with low birth weight infants 118 conditions of particular severity in pregnancy include mercury poisoning and lead poisoning 43 to minimize exposure to environmental toxins the american college of nursemidwives recommends checking whether the home has lead paint washing all fresh fruits and vegetables thoroughly and buying organic produce and avoiding cleaning products labeled toxic or any product with a warning on the label 119pregnant women can also be exposed to toxins in the workplace including airborne particles the effects of wearing n95 filtering facepiece respirators are similar for pregnant women as nonpregnant women and wearing a respirator for one hour does not affect the fetal heart rate 120sexual activity main article sexual activity during pregnancy most women can continue to engage in sexual activity throughout pregnancy 121 most research suggests that during pregnancy both sexual desire and frequency of sexual relations decrease 122 123 in context of this overall decrease in desire some studies indicate a secondtrimester increase preceding a decrease during the third trimester 124 125sex during pregnancy is a lowrisk behavior except when the healthcare provider advises that sexual intercourse be avoided for particular medical reasons 121 for a healthy pregnant woman there is no safe or right way to have sex during pregnancy 121 pregnancy alters the vaginal flora with a reduction in microscopic speciesgenus diversity 126exercise regular aerobic exercise during pregnancy appears to improve or maintain physical fitness 127 physical exercise during pregnancy does appear to decrease the risk of csection 128 bed rest outside of research studies is not recommended as there is no evidence of benefit and potential harm 129the clinical practice obstetrics committee of canada recommends that all women without contraindications should be encouraged to participate in aerobic and strengthconditioning exercises as part of a healthy lifestyle during their pregnancy 130 although an upper level of safe exercise intensity has not been established women who were regular exercisers before pregnancy and who have uncomplicated pregnancies should be able to engage in high intensity exercise programs 130 in general participation in a wide range of recreational activities appears to be safe with the avoidance of those with a high risk of falling such as horseback riding or skiing or those that carry a risk of abdominal trauma such as soccer or hockey 131the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists reports that in the past the main concerns of exercise in pregnancy were focused on the fetus and any potential maternal benefit was thought to be offset by potential risks to the fetus however they write that more recent information suggests that in the uncomplicated pregnancy fetal injuries are highly unlikely 131 they do however list several circumstances when a woman should contact her health care provider before continuing with an exercise program vaginal bleeding dyspnea before exertion dizziness headache chest pain muscle weakness preterm labor decreased fetal movement amniotic fluid leakage and calf pain or swelling to rule out thrombophlebitis  131sleep it has been suggested that shift work and exposure to bright light at night should be avoided at least during the last trimester of pregnancy to decrease the risk of psychological and behavioral problems in the newborn 132complications main article complications of pregnancy each year ill health as a result of pregnancy is experienced sometimes permanently by more than 20 million women around the world 133 in 2013 complications of pregnancy resulted in 293000 deaths down from 377000 deaths in 1990 common causes include maternal bleeding 44000 complications of abortion 44000 high blood pressure of pregnancy 29000 maternal sepsis 24000 and obstructed labor 19000 11the following are some examples of pregnancy complications pregnancy induced hypertension anemia 134postpartum depression postpartum psychosis thromboembolic disorders these are the leading cause of death in pregnant women in the us 135 136puppp pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy a skin disease that develops around the 32nd week signs are red plaques papules and itchiness around the belly button that then spreads all over the body except for the inside of hands and face ectopic pregnancy implantation of the embryo outside the uterus hyperemesis gravidarum excessive nausea and vomiting that is more severe than normal morning sickness pulmonary embolism blood clots that form in the legs that can migrate to the lungs 136there is also an increased susceptibility and severity of certain infections in pregnancy intercurrent diseases main article intercurrent disease in pregnancy a pregnant woman may have intercurrent diseases defined as disease not directly caused by the pregnancy but that may become worse or be a potential risk to the pregnancy diabetes mellitus and pregnancy deals with the interactions of diabetes mellitus not restricted to gestational diabetes and pregnancy risks for the child include miscarriage growth restriction growth acceleration fetal obesity macrosomia polyhydramnios too much amniotic fluid and birth defects thyroid disease in pregnancy can if uncorrected cause adverse effects on fetal and maternal wellbeing the deleterious effects of thyroid dysfunction can also extend beyond pregnancy and delivery to affect neurointellectual development in the early life of the child demand for thyroid hormones is increased during pregnancy which may cause a previously unnoticed thyroid disorder to worsen untreated celiac disease can cause spontaneous abortion miscarriage intrauterine growth restriction small for gestational age low birthweight and preterm birth often reproductive disorders are the only manifestation of undiagnosed celiac disease and most cases are not recognized complications or failures of pregnancy cannot be explained simply by malabsorption but by the autoimmune response elicited by the exposure to gluten which causes damage to the placenta the glutenfree diet avoids or reduces the risk of developing reproductive disorders in pregnant women with celiac disease 137 138 also pregnancy can be a trigger for the development of celiac disease in genetically susceptible women who are consuming

pregnant women to develop thrombosis blood clots pregnancy itself is a factor of hypercoagulability pregnancyinduced hypercoagulability as a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent post partum bleeding 140 however in combination with an underlying hypercoagulable states the risk of thrombosis or embolism may become substantial 140medical imaging ct scanning  volume rendered in this case

routine prenatal care magnetic resonance imaging mri without mri contrast agents as well as obstetric ultrasonography are not associated with any risk for the mother or the fetus and are the imaging techniques of choice for pregnant women 141 projectional radiography xray computed tomography and nuclear medicine imaging result in some degree of ionizing radiation exposure but in most cases the absorbed doses are not associated with harm to the baby 141 at higher dosages effects can include miscarriage birth defects and intellectual disability 141epidemiology see also pregnancy rate and

bondone visitation circa 1305in most cultures pregnant women have a special status in society and receive particularly gentle care 147 at the same time they are subject to expectations that may exert great psychological pressure such as having to produce a son and heir in many traditional societies pregnancy must be preceded by marriage on pain of ostracism of mother and illegitimate child overall pregnancy is accompanied by numerous customs that are often subject to ethnological research often rooted in traditional medicine or religion the baby shower is an example of a modern custom pregnancy is an important topic in sociology of the family the prospective child may preliminarily be placed into numerous social roles the parents relationship and the relation between parents and their surroundings are also affected a belly cast may be made during pregnancy as a keepsake arts main article pregnancy in art images of pregnant women especially small figurines were made in traditional cultures in many places and periods though it is rarely one of the most common types of image these include ceramic figures from some precolumbian cultures and a few figures from most of the ancient mediterranean cultures many of these seem to be connected with fertility identifying whether such figures are actually meant to show pregnancy is often a problem as well as understanding their role in the culture concerned among the oldest surviving examples of the depiction of pregnancy are prehistoric figurines found across much of eurasia and collectively known as venus figurines some of these appear to be pregnant due to the important role of the mother of god in christianity the western visual arts have a long tradition of depictions of pregnancy especially in the biblical scene of the visitation and devotional images called a madonna del parto 148the unhappy scene usually called diana and callisto showing the moment of discovery of callisto s forbidden pregnancy is sometimes painted from the renaissance onwards gradually portraits of pregnant women began to appear with a particular fashion for pregnancy portraits in elite portraiture of the years around 1600 pregnancy and especially pregnancy of unmarried women is also an important motif in literature notable examples include hardys tess of the durbervilles and goethes faust pregnancy in art anatomical model of a pregnant woman stephan zick 16391715 1700 germanisches nationalmuseum statue of a pregnant woman macedonia bronze figure of a pregnant naked woman by danny osborne merrion square marcus gheeraerts the

medicine offers many forms of assisted reproductive technology for couples who stay childless against their will such as fertility medication artificial insemination in vitro fertilization and surrogacy abortion main article abortion an abortion is the termination of an embryo or fetus either naturally or via medical methods 149 when done electively it is more often done within the first trimester than the second and rarely in the third 32 not using contraception contraceptive failure poor family planning or rape can lead to undesired pregnancies legality of socially indicated abortions varies widely both internationally and through time in most countries of western europe abortions during the first trimester were a criminal offense a few decades ago  when but have since been legalized sometimes subject to mandatory consultations in germany for example as of 2009 less than 3 of abortions had a medical indication legal protection many countries have various legal regulations in place to protect pregnant women and their children maternity protection convention ensures that pregnant women are exempt from activities such as night shifts or carrying heavy stocks maternity leave typically provides paid leave from work during roughly the last trimester of pregnancy and for some time after birth notable extreme cases include norway 8 months with full pay and the united states no paid leave at all except in some states moreover many countries have laws against pregnancy discrimination in 2014 the american state of kentucky passed a law which allows prosecutors to charge a woman with criminal assault if she uses illegal drugs during her pregnancy and her fetus or newborn is considered harmed as a result 150in the united states laws make some actions that result in miscarriage or stillbirth crimes one such law is the federal unborn victims of violence act see also pseudopregnancy references a b what are some common signs of pregnancy eunice kennedy
