are there screening tests available although there are no screening tests currently available to screen the general population investigators at johns hopkins are working on developing new tests such as the endoscopic ultrasound it is hoped that these new tests may prove effective particularly when applied to slect groups of patients known to have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer such as individuals with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer ca199 is the best available tumor marker for following the progression of the disease but is only 80 accurate in identifying patients with pancreatic cancer due to the inability of ca199 to identify early potentially curable disease several other markers have been studied including span1 ca50 dupan2 elastase1 tissue polypeptide antigen and tissue polypeptidespecific antigen these markers have not performed nearly as well as the ca199 an ideal pancreatic cancer screening test should be a safe inexpensive highly accurate test that reliably diagnoses pancreas cancer at a stage when it is not causing symptoms in the patient this would provide that person the opportunity to take appropriate and effective action to treat and potentially cure the disease currently we cannot offer a screening test for pancreas cancer that begins to meet these demands however the potential for screening this disease is considerably improved compared to just a few years ago first of all we know more about which individuals have a genetic predisposition for developing this disease prior to the 1990s it was not widely appreciated how often pancreas cancer is an inherited disease now we know that individuals with abnormalities in certain genes such as brca2 p16 hnpcc and individuals with histories of familial pancreatitis and peutzjeghers syndrome are all predisposed to pancreatic cancer these are important discoveries however individuals who inherit damage to one of these genes still represent only a modest proportion of all those individuals at risk of developing pancreatic cancer secondly we now know much more about the changes in the dna and other molecules in the pancreas cells that give rise to pancreatic cancer most of these changes are not inherited and occur as the result of factors such as smoking diet and age importantly pancreatic cancer researchers are characterizing these specific changes in dna and other molecules armed with this knowledge it is hoped that over the next few years specific and extremely sensitive screening tests will be developed such a screening test will be able to detect pancreatic cancer at an early stage when it still cannot be visualized using state of the art diagnostic imaging techniques once such a screening panel is in place it can be offered to individuals who from their family history know that they are at particular risk of developing this disease because of the enormous need to develop a sensitive and specific screening text for early pancreatic cancer we have a research laboratory at johns hopkins dedicated to finding new screening tests for pancreatic cancer this lab is headed by dr michael goggins you can find out more about this exciting lab here
