a wheel containing two magnets passing by a hall effect sensor the magnetic piston 1 in this pneumatic cylinder will cause the hall effect sensors 2 and 3 mounted on its outer wall to activate when it is fully retracted or extended engine fan with hall effect sensor commonly used circuit symbol a hall effect sensor is a transducer that varies its output voltage in response to a magnetic field hall effect sensors are used for proximity switching positioning speed detection and current sensing applications 1in a hall effect sensor a thin strip of metal has a current applied along it in the presence of a magnetic field the electrons in the metal strip are deflected toward one edge producing a voltage gradient across the short side of the strip perpendicular to the feed current hall effect sensors have an advantage over inductive sensors in that while inductive sensors respond to a changing magnetic field which induces current in a coil of wire and produces voltage at its output hall effect sensors can detect static nonchanging magnetic fields in its simplest form the sensor operates as an analog transducer directly returning a voltage with a known magnetic field its distance from the hall plate can be determined using groups of sensors the relative position of the magnet can be deduced frequently a hall sensor is combined with threshold detection so that it acts as and is called a switch commonly seen in industrial applications such as the pictured pneumatic cylinder they are also used in consumer equipment for example some computer printers use them to detect missing paper and open covers they can also be used in computer keyboards applications that require ultrahigh reliability hall sensors are commonly used to time the speed of wheels and shafts such as for internal combustion engine ignition timing tachometers and antilock braking systems they are used in brushless dc electric motors to detect the position of the permanent magnet in the pictured wheel with two equally spaced magnets the voltage from the sensor will peak twice for each revolution this arrangement is commonly used to regulate the speed of disk drives contents  hide 1 hall probe2

switch8 references9 further reading hall probe  edita hall probe contains an indium compound semiconductor crystal such as indium antimonide mounted on an aluminum backing plate and encapsulated in the probe head the plane of the crystal is perpendicular to the probe handle connecting leads from the crystal are brought down through the handle to the circuit box when the hall probe is held so that the magnetic field lines are passing at right angles through the sensor of the probe the meter gives a reading of the value of magnetic flux density b a current is passed through the crystal which when placed in a magnetic field has a  hall effect  voltage developed across it the hall effect is seen when a conductor is passed through a uniform magnetic field the natural electron drift of the charge carriers causes the magnetic field to apply a lorentz force the force exerted on a charged particle in an electromagnetic field to these charge carriers the result is what is seen as a charge separation with a buildup of either positive or negative charges on the bottom or on the top of the plate the crystal measures 5 mm square the probe handle being made of a non ferrous material has no disturbing effect on the field a hall probe should be calibrated against a known value of magnetic field strength for a solenoid the hall probe is placed in the center working principle  editwhen a beam of charged particles passes through a magnetic field forces act on the particles and the beam is deflected from a straight path the flow of electrons through a conductor form a beam of charged carriers when a conductor is placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the electrons they will be deflected from a straight path as a consequence one plane of the conductor will become negatively charged and the opposite side will become positively charged the voltage between these planes is called the hall voltage 2when the force on the charged particles from the electric field balances the force produced by magnetic field the separation of them will stop if the current is not changing then the hall voltage is a measure of the magnetic flux density basically there are two kinds of hall effect sensors one is linear which means the output of voltage linearly depends on magnetic flux density the other is called threshold which means there will be a sharp decrease of output voltage at each magnetic flux density materials  editthe key factor determining sensitivity of hall effect sensors is high electron mobility as a result the following materials are especially suitable for hall effect sensorsgallium arsenide ga asindium arsenide in asindium phosphide in pindium antimonide in sbgraphene 3signal processing and interface  edithall effect sensors are linear transducers as a result such sensors require a linear circuit for processing of the sensors output signal such a linear circuitprovides a constant driving current to the sensorsamplifies the output signal in some cases the linear circuit may cancel the offset voltage of hall effect sensors moreover ac modulation of the driving current may also reduce the influence of this offset voltage hall effect sensors with linear transducers are commonly integrated with digital electronics 4 this enables advanced corrections to the sensors characteristics eg temperature coefficient corrections and digital interfacing to microprocessor systems in some solutions of ic hall effect sensors a dsp is used which provides for more choices among processing techniques 1 167the hall effect sensor interfaces may include input diagnostics fault protection for transient conditions and shortopen circuit detection it may also provide and monitor the current to the hall effect sensor itself there are precision ic products available to handle these features advantages  edita hall effect sensor may operate as an electronic switch such a switch costs less than a mechanical switch and is much more reliable it can be operated up to 100 k hz it does not suffer from contact bounce because a solid state switch with hysteresis is used rather than a mechanical contact it will not be affected by environmental contaminants since the sensor is in a sealed package therefore it can be used under severe conditions in the case of linear sensor for the magnetic field strength measurements a hall effect sensorcan measure a wide range of magnetic fieldsis available that can measure either north or south pole magnetic fieldscan be flat disadvantages  edithall effect sensors provide much lower measuring accuracy than fluxgate magnetometers or magnetoresistance based sensors moreover hall effect sensors drift significantly requiring compensation applications  editposition sensing  editsensing the presence of magnetic objects connected with the position sensing is the most common industrial application of hall effect sensors especially those operating in the switch mode onoff mode the hall effect sensors are also used in the brushless dc motor to sense the position of the rotor and to switch the transistors in the right sequence smartphones use hall sensors to determine if the flip cover accessory is closed 5direct current dc transformers  edithall effect sensors may be utilized for contactless measurements of dc current in current transformers in such a case the hall effect sensor is mounted in the gap in magnetic core around the current conductor 6 as a result the dc magnetic flux can be measured and the dc current in the conductor can be calculated automotive fuel level indicator  editthe hall sensor is used in some automotive fuel level indicators the main principle of operation of such indicator is position sensing of a floating element 7 this can either be done by using a vertical float magnet or a rotating lever sensor in a vertical float system a permanent magnet is mounted on the surface of a floating object the current carrying conductor is fixed on the top of the tank lining up with the magnet when the level of fuel rises an increasing magnetic field is applied on the current resulting in higher hall voltage as the fuel level decreases the hall voltage will also decrease the fuel level is indicated and displayed by proper signal condition of hall voltage in a rotating lever sensor a diametrically magnetized ring magnet rotates about a linear hall sensor the sensor only measures the perpendicular vertical component of the field the strength of the field measured correlates directly to the angle of the lever and thus the level of the
