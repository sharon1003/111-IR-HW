horizontal analysis august 16 2017horizontal analysis overview horizontal analysis is the comparison of historical financial information over a series of reporting periods or of the ratios derived from this financial information the intent is to see if any numbers are unusually high or low in comparison to the information for bracketing periods which may then trigger a detailed investigation of the reason for the difference the analysis is most commonly a simple grouping of information that is sorted by period but the numbers in each succeeding period can also be expressed as a percentage of the amount in the baseline year with the baseline amount being listed as 100 a common problem with horizontal analysis is that the aggregation of information in the financial statements may have changed over time due to ongoing changes in the chart of accounts so that revenues expenses assets or liabilities may shift between different accounts and therefore appear to cause variances when comparing account balances from one period to the next when conducting a horizontal analysis it is useful to conduct the analysis for all of the financial statements at the same time so that you can see the complete impact of operational results on a companys financial condition over the review period for example in the two examples below the income statement analysis shows a company having an excellent second year but the related balance sheet analysis shows that it is having trouble funding growth given the decline in cash increase in accounts payable and increase in debt horizontal analysis of the income statement horizontal analysis of the income statement is usually in a twoyear format such as the one shown below with a variance also shown that states the difference between the two years for each line item an alternative format is to simply add as many years as will fit on the page without showing a variance so that you can see general changes by account over multiple years a third format is to include a vertical analysis of each year in the report so that each year shows expenses as a percentage of the total revenue in that year20x1 20x2 variance sales 1000000 1500000 500000cost of goods sold 400000 600000 200000gross margin 600000 900000 300000salaries and wages 250000 375000 125000office rent 50000 80000 30000supplies 10000 20000 10000utilities 20000 30000 10000other expenses 90000 110000 20000total expenses 420000 615000 195000net profit 180000 285000 105000horizontal analysis of the balance sheet horizontal analysis of the balance sheet is also usually in a twoyear format such as the one shown below with a variance showing the difference between the two years for each line item an alternative format is to add as many years as will fit on the page without showing a variance so that you can see general changes by account over multiple years a lessused format is to include a vertical analysis of each year in the report so that each year shows each line item as a percentage of the total assets in that year20x1 20x2 variance cash 100000 80000  20000accounts receivable 350000 525000 175000inventory 150000 275000 125000total current assets 600000 880000 280000fixed assets 400000 800000 400000total assets 1000000 1680000 680000accounts payable 180000 300000 120000accrued liabilities 70000 120000 50000total current liabilities 250000 420000 170000notes payable 300000 525000 225000total liabilities 550000 945000 395000capital stock 200000 200000 0retained earnings 250000 535000 285000total equity 450000 735000 285000total liabilities and equity 1000000 1680000 680000horizontal analysis can be misused to report skewed findings this can happen when the analyst modifies the number of comparison periods used to make the results appear unusually good or bad for example the current periods profits may appear excellent when only compared with those of the previous month but are actually quite poor when compared to the results for the same month in the preceding year consistent use of comparison periods can mitigate this problem similar terms horizontal analysis is also known as trend analysis related courses business ratios guidebook financial analysis the interpretation of financial statements steven bragg financial analysis
