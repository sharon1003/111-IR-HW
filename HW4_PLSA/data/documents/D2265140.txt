according to web md there are 2 primary components for effectively losing weight and keeping it off for the longterm eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly and from this perspective beyond diet’s meal plans seem to deliver although the only program that includes exercise guidance is their bd edge 20 because of this you’ll need to supplement your nutrition with regular exercise if you choose any of beyond diet’s other programs depending on your weight loss experience this could be really easy or a huge hurdle to overcome what constitutes healthy weight loss although some of beyond diet’s programs specifically the bd super cleanse claim to help you “lose weight faster than ever” keep in mind that healthy weight loss amounts to about 12 pounds per week or 48 pounds per month granted this is something you can sustain over the long term assuming you continue eating right and exercising regularly but if you’re looking to quickly drop a ton of weight you might be disappointed

might find that you reach a plateau and have difficulty losing as much weight and since beyond diet is an online program you’ll be responsible for staying motivated and sticking to your plan during these times in other words you might have to dig deep the good news is that some of beyond diet’s programs include regular motivation while all of them give you access to a community of health professionals and likeminded individuals ultimately though the onus is on you to stick it out are customers losing weight with beyond diet overall beyond diet appears to have a fairly positive online

lain harrisonburg va jan 27 2018verified reviewer i absolutely love the beyond diet because there’s no calorie counting and the meals are always satisfying and feeling it’s real food that makes sense i have so much energy i’ve lost 12 pounds in as little as 14 days eating food that i love this is a lifestyle change not a temporary diet and you never starve yourselfbottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was this review helpfulyes no comments 07 out 7 people found this review helpful wonderful program by joan sims south carolina may 17 2017verified reviewer i dont get all the negative stuff i have tried so many different plans but maybe i never gave them 100 i started beyond a week ago it wasnt the weight loss i was after but that was a welcome addition i went in with the mindset that i was going to lose fat then everything else would fall into place i am 60 years old 275 lbs and a diabetic nothing ever worked so on this week following the plan exactly my sugar every morning was 70 80 all under 100 mind you eating the way i was my a1c was 11 so now my sugars are great in the first four days i lost lbs but best of all my pants were loose i obviously lost more than weight which is whats making everything fall into place if your sugars are not right the rest is like banging your head against the wall so i trust this program but you have to stay focused and committed for those who say its not worth it or that its a scam its not the program its you i definitely recommend this i am on my way to being insulin free which also blocks you from weight loss bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was this review helpfulyes no comments 0advertisement7 out 7 people found this review helpful great program by carrie l dayton ohio apr 19 2017verified reviewer like many others who have stated prior to me i am unsure why there are so many negative reviews i got this program a few months back and my husband and i had tried it and i lost 15 lbs while my husband lost 25 i have noticed that my metabolism has sped up as i am able to keep the weight off and i dont have cravings for things i was addicted to ie sugar and caffeine i did try the monthly subscription and had a hard time contacting someone to cancel like another reviewer stated they did refund me though once looking through my account and seeing the email i sent within the trial period the problem i had with the monthly subscription was that it was via online and i wanted a paper copy mailed to me for that price the program has a lot of alternatives so if you dont like something simply replace that meal with one from another day i started back on this program a week ago and feel really good again its hard to let a hard habit go guys and a quick diet fix is not the solution this program purely teaches you to eat clean bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was this review helpfulyes no comments 03 out 4 people found this review helpful beyond the diet by nikol thailand apr 11 2017verified reviewer after paying 66 there is no way to even create my accountbottom line no i would not recommend this to a friend was this review helpfulyes no comments 0advertisement6 out 6 people found this review helpful so far so good by teresa tennessee feb 2 2017verified reviewer i have only been on the plan for several weeks now but so far so good people really do complain too much i think about food prep even i found myself at times getting a little unnerved by it but i started thinking of it in a different way i am not going to change the way i feel and look if i dont make an effort to change the way i eat i love food i am a foodie and it shows i have been on those plans where you drink two shakes a day and eat one meal that is not for me because i love the process of eating so this is really perfect for me it was just a matter of becoming more organized with meal prep and using healthy alternatives to cut the cravings i have not been on the plan long enough to experience billing problems and i hope i dont bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was this review helpfulyes no comments 018 out 18 people found this review helpful worked good for me by james c fleck conesus ny aug 15 2016verified reviewer i lost 75 lbs in less than a year without starving myself i did not use everything organic either but if you really look into this diet it make a lot of common sense i highly recommend it bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was this review helpfulyes no comments 021 out 22 people found this review helpful whats with all the negative reviews by jenna missouri jul 8 2016verified reviewer i started this healthy eating plan 3 weeks ago and have lost 15 pounds there are a ton of videos with healthy recipes workout videos and other resources that have helped me become motivated theres a whole community that is there to help support you when you need it the first 28 days are preplanned meals that tell you exactly what to eat and come with a convenient shopping list that is broken down into what you need for each of the first four weeks after that the program leads you through figuring out what metabolism type you are what that means for you and how to create healthy meals based on that at one point i decided i didnt want the monthly supplements anymore and i emailed customer service they got back right away and canceled the monthly subscription with no problem maybe theyre better at emailing then they are with phones bottom line i love the recipes i love the way i feel and i am excited to continue discovering recipes i like more than what i was eating before delicious healthy food that leaves me feeling full bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was this review helpfulyes no comments 019 out 23 people found this review helpful puzzled by these negative reviews by donna lighthouse point fl mar 10 2016verified reviewer i purchased beyond diet for 4700 and tried the bd monthly for 1495 this was a couple months ago and because of my own motivation issues nothing to do with whether beyond diet works or not havent started yet i will this week however when i decided i did not want the 1495 monthly charge i contacted them and received immediate response the website is so easy to get on its puzzling to hear people cant access it you need selfmotivation to do any diet this one is no different these negative reviews seem to come from angry people who dont want to diet and expect to miraculously loose weight just by paying the 4700 i do not regret buying this i got a lot of helpful information several books tons of recipes and helpful hints i even got tips on how to buy untainted olive oil which if you look in the news media you will know is true there is nothing wrong with beyond diet bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend was this review helpfulyes no comments 034 out 41 people found this review helpful horrible company by catherine bellingham wa feb 21 2016verified reviewer dont be fooled by this bunch once you make the initial payment the requests to pay for more tips are relentless and forget trying to reach them by phone i tried to cancel during the trial period but no one responded to me until i was beyond the 60 day time limit then they were very quick to get back to me to tell me it was too late for a refund this is the closest thing to a scam that ive ever experienced bottom line no i would not recommend this to a friend was this review helpfulyes no comments 029 out 32 people found this review helpfulthey are over charging me by trisha new york feb 13 2016verified reviewer to join it was 37 they added on 1495 for a monthly fee for who knows what it was attached to the bill which i could not take it off after watching a 30 minute video telling me all these awesome things i would get for free i decided to let them charge monthly fee i figured i would call and have it removed if anything well after 20 attempts to
