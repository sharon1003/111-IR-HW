article history views pdf cite permissions share abstractbackground intermittent fasting if was shown to increase wholebody insulin sensitivity but it is uncertain whether if selectively influences intermediary metabolism such selectivity might be advantageous when adapting to periods of food abundance and food shortage objective the objective was to assess effects of if on intermediary metabolism and energy expenditure design glucose glycerol and valine fluxes were measured after 2 wk of if and a standard diet sd in 8 lean healthy volunteers in a crossover design in the basal state and during a 2step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with assessment of energy expenditure and phosphorylation of muscle protein kinase b akt glycogen synthase kinase gsk and mammalian target of rapamycine m tor we hypothesized that if selectively increases peripheral glucose uptake and lowers proteolysis thereby protecting protein stores results no differences in body weight were observed between the if and sd groups peripheral glucose uptake and hepatic insulin sensitivity during the clamp did not significantly differ between the if and sd groups likewise lipolysis and proteolysis were not different between the if and sd groups if decreased resting energy expenditure if had no effect on the phosphorylation of akt but significantly increased the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase phosphorylation of m tor was significantly lower after if than after the sd conclusions if does not affect wholebody glucose lipid or protein metabolism in healthy lean men despite changes in muscle phosphorylation of gsk and m tor the decrease in resting energy expenditure after if indicates the possibility of an increase in weight during if when caloric intake is not adjusted this study was registered at wwwtrialregisternl as ntr1841 issue section energy and protein metabolism introductionintermittent fasting if has been suggested to mimic cycles of feast and famine food abundance and food shortage as may have been physiologic in the late paleolithic era  1  accordingly it has been postulated that humans have developed metabolic pathways that oscillate with the cycles of feastfamine and physical activity–rest  2  such adaptive mechanisms were proposed to be part of a thrifty genotype necessary for survival during shortage of food protecting muscle lipid and glycogen stores as well as lean body mass lbm ie body protein during fasting while replenishing fuel stores during refeeding  2 3  previous human studies of the metabolic effects of if are scarce and unequivocal  1 4 5  however the increase of wholebody insulin sensitivity after 2 wk of if in healthy volunteers as shown by halberg et al  1 is of interest because it may provide a simple tool to improve insulin sensitivity in subjects with insulin resistance if consists of repetitive bouts of shortterm fasting the latter is characterized by integrated alterations in intermediary metabolism that guarantee substrate availability for energy production necessary for survival  6 – 9  specifically fasting ie 62 h induces a reduction in peripheral insulin sensitivity via a decrease in phosphorylation of both protein kinase b akt and as160 after shortterm fasting  8  hepatic insulin sensitivity may be affected by fasting as well  10  but not all studies have confirmed this  11  to date it is uncertain whether if influences hepatic insulin sensitivity  1  furthermore shortterm fasting increases proteolysis  12 13 and decreases protein synthesis  14  the fall in protein synthesis and the rise in proteolysis during shortterm fasting occur through decreased activation of akt and the downstream mammalian target of rapamycine m tor  15  it is currently unknown whether if affects protein metabolism via changes in activity of m tor in this study we measured glucose glycerol and valine fluxes after 2 wk of if and after 2 wk of a standard isocaloric diet sd both in the basal state and during a 2step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp stableisotope technique immunoblots were performed of crucial signaling proteins in the insulin and m tor signaling pathways in muscle tissue samples obtained in the basal state and during the clamp we hypothesized that if selectively increases peripheral insulin sensitivity of glucose uptake via increased phosphorylation of akt and as160

discussionin this study we investigated the effect of 2 wk of if on hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity egp and glucose uptake respectively lipolysis and proteolysis in comparison with 2 wk of an isocaloric sd in lean healthy subjects the stable body weight and body composition in our study indicates that in general our findings cannot be attributed to weight loss in contrast with many earlier studies  4 5  the importance of the significant decrease in ree after if median decrease in ree 59 kcald is illustrated by the calculation that on a year’s basis such a decrease results in a difference of 21535 kcal approximating the caloric equivalent of 3 kg body fat it has been postulated that a decreased ree reflects a calorie shortage per se  25  our results strongly argue against such a mechanism because our participants were not calorie restricted and did not lose weight albeit in a relative short period changes in ree have been shown after shortterm fasting  26  but it is of interest that already after repeated periods of if an adaptation apparently occurs that spares energy stores this change in ree could not be attributed to changes in the traditional glucoregulatory hormones or adiponectin neither did we find changes in the thyroid hormones but this does not take into account possible changes in intracellular differences in triiodothyronine production the type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase has been implicated in the regulation of energy expenditure and insulin signaling  27  whether iodothyronine deiodinase changes after if as described recently after shortterm fasting by heemstra et al  28  remains to be elucidated finally a decrease in ree may also increase body weight if isocaloric if diets are consumed for longer periods andor if physical activity is unaltered our study period has not been long enough to increase body weight although halberg et al  1 showed an increased glucose infusion rate during the hyperinsulinemic clamp in their study we were not able to discern differences in peripheral or hepatic insulin sensitivity despite equal diets and a crossover design the lack of an effect on peripheral insulin sensitivity was strengthened by the data on phosphorylated as160thr 642 —a downstream target of akt that is involved in the translocation of glut4 to the plasma membrane insulinmediated phosphorylation of as160 was shown to be decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes and after shortterm fasting  8 29  ffas may be a factor in modulating peripheral insulin sensitivity because the interfering role of ffas and their metabolites with the insulin signaling cascade is generally appreciated  30 31  although the 20h fasting period in our study was long enough to stimulate lipolysis and fao  32  we did not detect differences in insulinmediated supression of lipolysis expressed both as μ mol · kg −1 · min −1 and μ molkcal or plasma ffa intriguingly it was shown that an insulinmediated decrease in interstitial glycerol concentrations subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue was greater after if  1  whether these conflicting results are explained by adipose tissue depot–specific differences in lipolysis are of interest and remain to be elucidated if did not affect fao in the present study although fao was higher in the study by heilbronn et al  4  however in that study subjects were studied after a 36h fast in contrast with the overnight fast in our study  4  we previously showed that decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity during shortterm fasting in lean healthy humans is explained by lower phosphorylation of muscle aktser 473 under hyperinsulinemic circumstances  8  akt is a 56k d serinethreonine kinase and a mediator of many insulin effects with a complex regulation  33  we only measured phosphorylation of these signaling proteins during step 2 of the clamp and not during step 1 the data on akt were in line with the results of both muscle as160 content and the rd during step 2 of the clamp which show no effect of if on peripheral glucose uptake however in the present study basal and clamp p gsk3ser 9 values were remarkably higher after if and suggest adaptation that favors glycogen replenishment gsk is another downstream target of akt that once phosphorylated stimulates glycogen synthesis  34 35  we showed previously that shortterm fasting does not influence the phosphorylation of gsk3ser 9 in the basal state nor during hyperinsulinemia  8  the increased phosphorylation of gsk opposed to the unchanged phosphorylated as160 suggests that divergent effects on downstream targets of akt might be present this can be explained by different aktisoforms that exist  36 or subcellular localization of the intermediate akt itself additionally we measured the activation on the serine 473 residue not taking into account possible phosphorylation of the threonine 308 residue although we found no differences in wholebody nogd between the if and sd groups we cannot exclude increased glycogen synthesis in the vastus lateralis muscle of our subjects the adipokine adiponectin is thought to increase insulin sensitivity and fao and is decreased in insulinresistant states such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus  37  in contrast with our findings the peaks in adiponectin after each fasting period in the study by halberg et al  1 were suggested to cause the observed increased insulin sensitivity our findings on adiponectin however were in line with the similar peripheral insulin sensitivity and fao after if and the sd protein metabolism during if has not been investigated in humans to our knowledge intracellular valine contributes to the citric acid cycle intermediate succinylco a via transamination to α kiv that is converted to propionylco a α kiv ra is assumed to reflect intracellular valine enrichment and proteolysis  38  we could not detect an effect on wholebody protein metabolism during the clamps which means that if does not seem to protect protein stores m tor is a protein serinethreonine kinase that functions as a central element in signaling pathways involved in the control of cell growth and proliferation and is also involved in protein synthesis and activated by growth factors and nutrientsensitive pathways eg amino acids  39  because we did not assess protein synthesis rates we cannot support that the lower m tor phosphorylation in the basal state after if than after the sd reflects lower protein synthesis as shown earlier for shortterm fasting  14  lbm was not affected although the duration of our study may have been insufficient to observe measurable effects on muscle mass of interest m tor plays a role in autophagia and probably life span  40  indeed alternateday fasting has been suggested to increase life span although caloric restriction may play a greater role  4 5  whether such mechanisms are important in if remains to be elucidated in conclusion if does not change insulinmediated peripheral glucose uptake hepatic insulin sensitivity insulin sensitivity of adipose tissue or proteolysis however if affects muscle signaling pathways that may be beneficial in storing glycogen gsk or modulating nutrient signaling m tor the decrease in ree after if may precede weight gain during if when caloric intake is not adjusted whether if is beneficial at improving peripheral insulin resistance in obese insulinresistant subjects remains to be established we thank afc ruiter for excellent assistance with the stableisotope analyses jh houbenweerts for performing
