the psoriasiseasing effect of enbrel a drug that dampens inflammatory immune responses lasts for at least two years a largescale clinical trial shows enbrel acts like a very specific sponge that soaks up only one thing a chemical messenger called tumor necrosis factor or tnf that plays a major role in psoriasis by triggering inflammatory skindamaging arthritiscausing immune responses because tnf also helps the body fight off infection and cancer there have been nagging worries that safety problems might arise in patients on longterm enbrel treatment — especially those who need higher doses also doctors wondered whether the drugs psoriasiseasing effects would wear off over time to answer these questions stephen tyring m d ph d of the university of texas health science center at houston and colleagues signed up 618 adult psoriasis patients for the study to enter the study patients had to have at least moderate psoriasis — that is psoriasis affecting 10 percent of their body surface study patients tended to have much more severe disease with an average 27 percent of their body surface affected also at least one systemic psoriasis treatment or phototherapy had to have failed to help patients received twiceweekly injections under the skin of enbrel at the 50milligram dose for 96 weeks — nearly two years half the patients received placebo injections for the first 12 weeks of the study after that everyone in the study got enbrel the results at week 96 half the patients in both groups had at least a 75 percent reduction in psoriasis severity without any increase in infections or other serious diseases safety is always of utmost concern tyring tells web md we saw no increased risk of heart attacks or anything else and safety did not appear to be a problem in terms of cancers or malignancies a main question for longterm enbrel treatment is whether its effects wear off for patients who take high doses for a long time the answer is psoriasis clearance was maintained tyring says the bottom line is that all of this is an understatement in real life we rarely tell patients just use this enbrel and that is it we use these psoriasis medications in combination — a topical solution on the legs or scalp and also light therapy when we do that we see efficacy far beyond that noted in the study university of miami researcher jonette keri m d ph d chief of dermatology at the miami va hospital says she has patients whose psoriasis flares up unless she keeps them on the high doses of enbrel used in the tyring study this study should give some reassurance to patients that they are not at any higher risk of cancer if they take enbrel long term keri tells web md keri was not involved in the tyring study but will be one of the investigators in another longterm study of enbrel keri notes that patients taking enbrel should remain alert for symptoms of any of the drugs rare side effects most of these adverse events she says can be identified well before any lasting harm occurs side effects include serious infections nervous system disorders and blood disorders we dont know the effects of years of use but enbrel has been used to treat arthritis for years keri says tyring notes that about a third of psoriasis patients suffer psoriasisassociated arthritis enbrel he says is particularly helpful in relieving this condition keri agrees the good thing is that with the arthritis patients feel good in a week or so she says and over the next four or five or six weeks their skin catches up and starts to look better for some people it is absolutely great but it is a very expensive medicine and the higher does will cost more psoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by thick red silvery white skin patches it often affects the skin of the scalp elbows and knees who should take enbrel for psoriasis it is not for everybody but enbrel is particularly helpful for psoriasis patients with joint involvement those with extensive skin involvement those whose psoriasis affects inhibits daily function and those who have not had success with other therapies tyring says tyring and colleagues report their findings in the june issue of archives of dermatology by daniel de noon reviewed by louise chang m d by daniel de noon reviewed by louise chang m d © 2007 web md inc all rights reserved
