succulents are readily available plants that are easy to grow in an apartment they require minimal amounts of light and care and most varieties do not take up much space“succulents are the hottest most soughtafter plants for interior landscaping” said nancy silverman president and owner of plantscaping the foliage of succulents is fleshy and tends to be architectural and geometric in shape cactus plants which are included in the succulent family are covered with spines and spherical in shape“succulents are very clean crisp trim and tailored plants” said silverman “their silhouettes are beautiful”growing conditions“growing any of the succulents and cacti is foolproof” said chris murray manager of perennials and annual plants at gali’s florist and garden center native to desert regions where the temperatures are high during the day but cool at night “succulents and cacti are more tolerant of cold than people think” he said they grow well in temperatures that range from 55 to 85 degrees succulents and cacti “are very tolerant of lowlight conditions they don’t have to be near a window to thrive” he said in fact some succulents will grow in areas where there is no natural light such as rooms without windows silverman cautioned against placing succulents too close to heat sources“succulents should not be set on a radiator or heater or near glass that intensifies the sunlight plants that are placed too close to windows can burn in direct sun”containers and soil succulents grow well in clay pots that are porous and can breathe “most people like the appearance of cacti and succulents in a clay pot” murray said glazed ceramic pots also work well for these plants available in florist shops garden centers grocery stores and online succulents are usually sold in plastic pots“the plants can stay in the plastic pot that they came in for a year or so” he said “because they have such a small root system they do not need a larger pot right away”he recommended planting succulents in a sandy soil mixed with gravel water will soak through this type of soil mixture quickly and pool in the saucer or tray under the pot “drainage is key” he said if you’re thinking of planting succulents in a pot that doesn’t have a hole in the bottom add an extra layer of gravel at the bottom where excess water can accumulate but not touch the roots watering succulents store water in their fleshy leaves stems and shallow root systems the word “succulent” means “juicy plants”it is important not to overwater succulents because they will rot silverman recommended watering them every two to four weeks depending on the size of the pot and amount of light they receive “the lower the light the less water they need”she advised really soaking the plants then draining any excess water from the saucer“it’s not good to give them a lot of little drinks”make sure they have used up their water before watering them again she suggested touching the top of the soil and putting your finger down into the pot to feel how moist it is “you always want the top of the soil to feel dry never moist succulents do not like to set in water”for people who are just starting to grow succulents she recommended using a soil probe to determine whether the plant needs more moisture when the probe is inserted into the pot and pulled back up it brings up a core of soil if the soil at the bottom of the pot is still wet it is not time to rewater the plant fertilizer succulents are not heavy feeders said murray they should not be fed at all during the winter he suggested using jack’s classic an allpurpose plant food he recommended fertilizing plants only in the summer months and using onefourth of the recommended strength every time you water the plants the

plantscaping uses them cautiously in installations as they can be dangerous to children and pets “if you jam your hand into a prickly cactus you could get an infection”christmas cactus calling this
