last reply 10 years ago10 years ago mild reversible ischemiasdkbus1 posted after having a nuclear stress test i was diagnosed with mild reversible ischemia my doctor prescribed 81mg asprin lipitor and a petct scan im taking the asprin not sure i want or need to take the lipitor and do i really need the petct scan at this time what are your thoughts im 51 and 195 lbs ive lost over 10lbs over the last 78 months my bp is 14080 resting heart rate is 5560 total cholestrol is 215 ldl is up trigylcerids are high and hdl is low i have a strong family history of heart disease i am a very active person i run 1520 miles a week walk briskly on non running days ride a bike and workout with weights a couple times a week what should i be doing to put off any agressive procedures for as long as possible thanks10 years ago jamesbeckermanmd responded first of all great job on the weight loss and associated healthy lifestyle choices  thats fantastic heres the deal a mildly reversible defect on a nuclear stress test has a very good prognosis but it may be suggestive of coronary artery disease your doctor is taking a less invasive approach by not recommending an invasive angiogram and for a mildly reversible abnormality hisher decision is supported by the research but an aggressive preventive approach is appropriate aspirin and statins have been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks in people with coronary artery disease even if asymptomatic statins are amazing medications that provide a lot of benefit even beyond lowering cholesterol  antiinflammatory antioxidant the list goes on i suggest you discuss the rationale behind the petct scan a bit further these tests certainly have value but they provide significant radiation and are rather costly you should just have a clear sense of what your doctor is after  and i would also be interested to know if the test is covered by insurance10 years ago cardiostar usa1 responded hi one of two main concerns regarding a nuclear stress test is a reversible perfusion defect which indicates that an area of the heart muscle myocardium did not receive an adequate amount of blood ischemia at stress but did so at rest reversible ischemia caused by one or more narrowed or restenotic renarrowed coronary arteries or bypass grafts at rest the blood adequately reached these areas or regions eg anterior front wall posterior back wall inferior lower arealower wall area apicalapex bottom tip of the heart and lateral side wall normal resting blood pressure bp is under 12080 with 11070 or 11575 reported as being optimalideal as reported health dangers from bp vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic diastolic or both is elevated isolated diastolic hypertension isolated systolic hypertension and diastolicsystolic hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease renovascular disease high systolic bp appears as a significant indicator for heart complications including death in all ages but especially in middleaged and older adults additionally pulse pressure the difference between systolic and diastolic is important usually the resting in sitting position pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mm hg give or take a bit a consistently narrow say 2025 or less or consistently wide say 6065 or more pulse pressure is not good most important
