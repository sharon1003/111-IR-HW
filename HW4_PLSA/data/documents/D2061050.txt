due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca increased tear production was not seen in patients currently taking topical antiinflammatory drugs or using punctal plugs

instill one drop of restasis ® ophthalmic emulsion twice a day in each eye approximately 12 hours apart restasis ® can be used concomitantly with lubricant eye drops allowing a 15minute interval

known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the formulation5 w arnings and p recautions5 1 potential for eye injury and contamination be careful not to touch the vial tip to your eye or other surfaces to avoid potential for eye injury and contamination52 use with contact lenses restasis ® should not be administered while wearing contact lenses patients with decreased tear production typically should not wear contact lenses if contact lenses are worn they should be removed prior to the administration of the emulsion lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration of restasis ® ophthalmic emulsion6 a dverse r eactionsthe following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling potential for eye injury and contamination  see warnings and precautions  5161 clinical trials experience because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice in clinical trials the most common adverse reaction following the use of restasis ® was ocular burning 17 other reactions reported in 1 to 5 of patients included conjunctival hyperemia discharge epiphora eye pain foreign body sensation pruritus stinging and visual disturbance most often blurring62 postmarketing experience the following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of restasis ® because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure reported reactions have included hypersensitivity including eye swelling urticaria rare cases of severe angioedema face swelling tongue swelling pharyngeal edema and dyspnea and superficial injury of the eye from the vial tip touching the eye during administration8 u se in specific p opulations81 pregnancy risk summary clinical administration of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 005 is not detected systemically following topical ocular

teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses  see data  data animal data at maternally toxic doses 30 mgkgday in rats and 100 mgkgday in rabbits cyclosporine oral solution usp was teratogenic as indicated by increased pre and postnatal mortality reduced fetal weight and skeletal retardations these doses normalized to body surface area are 5000 and 32000 times greater respectively than the daily recommended human dose of one drop approximately 28 mc l of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 005 twice daily into each eye of a 60 kg person 0001 mgkgday assuming that the entire dose is absorbed no evidence of embryofetal toxicity was observed in rats or rabbits receiving cyclosporine during organogenesis at oral doses up to 17 mgkgday or 30 mgkgday respectively these doses in rats and rabbits are approximately 3000 and 10000 times greater respectively than the daily recommended human dose an oral dose of 45 mgkgday cyclosporine administered to rats from day 15 of pregnancy until day 21 postpartum produced maternal toxicity and an increase in postnatal mortality in offspring this dose is 7000 times greater than the daily recommended human dose no adverse effects in dams or offspring were observed at oral doses up to 15 mgkgday 2000 times greater than the daily recommended human dose82 lactation risk summary cyclosporine is known to appear in human milk following systemic administration but its presence in human milk following topical treatment has not been investigated although blood concentrations are undetectable following topical administration of restasis ® ophthalmic emulsion see clinical pharmacology  123  caution should be exercised when restasis ® is administered to a nursing woman the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for restasis ® and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from cyclosporine84 pediatric use safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 1685 geriatric use no overall difference in safety or effectiveness has been observed between elderly and younger patients11 d escriptionrestasis ® cyclosporine

to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca cyclosporine emulsion is thought to act as a partial immunomodulator the exact mechanism of action is not known123 pharmacokinetics blood cyclosporine a concentrations were measured using a specific high pressure liquid chromatographymass spectrometry assay blood concentrations of cyclosporine in all the samples collected after topical administration of restasis ® 005 twice daily in humans for up to 12 months were below the quantitation limit of 01 ngm l there was no detectable drug accumulation in

were conducted in male and female mice and rats in the 78week oral diet mouse study at doses of 1 4 and 16 mgkgday evidence of a statistically significant trend was found for lymphocytic lymphomas in females and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in middose males significantly exceeded the control value in the 24month oral diet rat study conducted at 05 2 and 8 mgkgday pancreatic islet cell adenomas significantly exceeded the control rate in the low dose level the hepatocellular carcinomas and pancreatic islet cell adenomas were not dose related the low doses in mice and rats are
