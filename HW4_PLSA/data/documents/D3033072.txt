against freezer burn1 large pot of boiling water2 large bowls one filled with cold water and ice1 sharp knife instructions step 1  get yer green beansstart with fresh green beans  as fresh as you can get if there is a delay between harvesting and freezing put it in the refrigerator or put ice on it and dont use beans that are old overripe or dried out see below step 2  wash the green beansim sure you can figure out how to rinse the green beans in plain cold or lukewarm water step 3  trim the ends and cut into smaller pieces just take a sharp knife and cut of both ends about 14 of an inch or half the width of an average womans little finger then cut them into pieces of the size you prefer usually about 1 inch long of course if your prefer french cut green beans you can cut the beans lengthwise instead or you can use a bean frencher the frencher enables you to prepare a huge quantity of beans quicklysee the bottom of this page for makes models prices and ordering info for bean frenchers step 4  get the pots ready get the pot of boiling water ready about 23 filled and a large bowl with ice and cold water step 5  blanch the green beans all fruits and vegetables contain enzymes and bacteria that over time break down the destroy nutrients and change the color flavor and texture of food during frozen storage green beans requires a brief heat treatment called blanching in boiling water or steam to destroy the enzymes before freezing blanching times for beans is 3 minutes the duration should be just long enough to stop the action of the enzymes and kill the bacteria begin counting the blanching time as soon as you place the green beans in the boiling water cover the kettle and boil at a high temperature for the required length of time you may use the same blanching water several times up to 5 be sure to add more hot water from the tap from time to time to keep the water level at the required height step 6  cool the green beans cool green beans immediately in ice water drain the green beans thoroughly this shouldnt take more than a minute after vegetables are blanched cool them quickly to prevent overcooking plunge the green beans into a large quantity of icecold water i keep adding more ice to it a good rule of thumb cool for the same amount of time as the blanch step for instance if you blanch sweet green beans for 7 minutes then cool in ice water for 7 minutes drain thoroughly step 7  bag the green beans i love the food savers  see this page for more information with their vacuum sealing i am not paid by them but these things really work if you dont have one ziploc bags work too but it is hard to get as much air out of the bags remove the air to prevent drying and freezer burn tip if you dont own a vacuum food sealer to freeze foods place food in a ziploc bags zip the top shut but leave enough space to insert the tip of a soda straw when straw is in place remove air by sucking the air out to remove straw press straw closed where inserted and finish pressing the bag closed as you remove straw it works fairly well but ill stick to the foodsaver since the bags are microwaveable and much thicker than a ziploc bag even the ziploc freezer bagsstep 8  donepop them into the freezer on the quick freeze shelf if you have onetips harvest early in the morning especially if the weather is hot to get peak flavor harvest the green beans at its peak maturity firm straight not lumpyprocess promptly after harvesting or keep cooled in the fridge or with ice until then frequently asked questions when you take your green beans out of the freezer how long do they take to cook just the same as storebought frozen green beans 3 to 5 minutes just until hot and tender ive frozen green beans but they seem so rubbery after being cooked any idea why generally that means the beans were either old to being with or they were overcooked it only takes 3 minutes to blanch the beans then plunge them immediately into ice water how long can they be frozen it depends upon how cold is your freezer and how you packed them colder deep freezes are better than frost free compartments which actually cycle above freezing thats how they melt the ice vacuum packing results in longer storage capability too thicker bags also help prevent freezer burn in general up to 9 months in a ziploc bag in an ordinary freezer and 14 months in a deep freeze in a vacuum packed bag after that the beans wont make you sick they just wont taste as good when blanching green beans you say to cook for 3 minutes only when we put the beans into the boiling water the boiling stops for several minutes before starting again this may add 5 or 10 minutes to the process is this good or should we take the beans out after 3 minutes even if the water hasnt come back to a boil excellent question the directions from the usda assume that were using a large enough pot and a large enough burner that it returns to a boil quickly say 2 or 3 minutes if you can use a larger pot on a hotter burner if thats not practical i just add a couple of minutes to the time  otherwise the food gets overcookedhome canning kits features everything you need to get
