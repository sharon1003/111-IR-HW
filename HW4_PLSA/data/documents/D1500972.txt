difficulty the feet should rest flat on the floor without the knees projecting above the upper leg a seat height of 16 to 18 inches fits the bill for most adults arm rests should support the forearms without raising the shoulders 7 to 9 above seat half arm rests enable the chair to be drawn up close to a table the depth of the seat should allow clearance from the front edge of the seat to the back of the occupants leg a seat that is too deep will press against the back of the legs forcing the occupant to slouch forward a seat that is too shallow may be unstable and feel precarious a seat depth of 15 to 18 inches is recommended for most adults the width of the seat often tapers by 2 to 3 from the front to the rear to allow clearance for legs and clothes in front while allowing elbow room in back many chairs have seats that are about 15 wide in the rear and 18 wide in the front for relaxed seating the seat should slant slightly toward the back about 5° to 8° to keep the occupant from slipping out of the chair however an office desk or typists chair often has a flat seat to facilitate leaning forward the back of the chair is often slanted backwards for comfort  up to 5° for a dining chair and 10° to 15° for a more casual chair as the chair back angle increases the seat should be tilted further backward to prevent forward sliding and lowered to prevent the front edge of the seat from pressing against the back of the legs the seat back should support the lumbar region without being so high as to interfere with the shoulder blades a back height of about 12 to 16 above the seat is ideal for most adults note that this guideline is often ignored for formal highbacked dining chairs the lower portion of the seat back first 48 should curve out or be left open to allow room

chairs  about 40 above the floor the runners commonly have a horizontal extension of about 30 with a curvature radius of 36 to 38 wood selection for chairs use hardwoods for pieces where shocks abrasions and other stresses will occur use softwoods in larger thicknesses to enable greater penetration of hardwood pieces eg spindles do not join softwood to softwood for bent chair parts select woods such as white oak or ash that can be steambent without fracturing legs the legs of a chair are subject to extreme stresses and abrasive forces select a wood such as hard maple that is hard resists impression and does not splinter stretchers abrasion resistance is less of an issue but a hard wood such as maple is recommended bending strength may be important eg feet placed on the stretcher so consider white oak or hickory seat many woods will suffice but soft woods such as pine or poplar are much easier to sculpt if you are intending to use hand tools early craftsmen typically chose soft woods for this reason back use hard woods such as maple oak or ash for spindles for longer spindles select a resilient wood that allows for movement  hickory is ideal softwoods in thicker dimensions may be used for arms and railsplease wait a few seconds sugaring hamburg
