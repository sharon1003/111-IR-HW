the roman catholic church answered many questions of internal reform raised by both protestants and by those who had remained inside the catholic church addressed the representational arts in a short and somewhat oblique passage in its decrees this was subsequently interpreted and expounded by clerical authors such as molanus the flemish theologian who demanded that paintings and sculptures in church contexts should depict their subjects clearly and powerfully and with decorum without the stylistic airs of mannerism the emergence of italian baroque painting  edittwo of the leading figures in the emergence of baroque painting in italy were michelangelo merisi da caravaggio and annibale carracci caravaggio 1571–1610 born and trained in milan stands as one of the most original and influential contributors to late sixteenth century and early seventeenth century european painting controversially he not only painted figures even those of classical or religious themes in contemporary clothing or as ordinary living men and women but his inclusion of the seedier side of life such as dirty feet was in marked contrast to the usual trend of the time which was to idealise the religious or classical figure by treating it with the decorum considered appropriate to its status he used tenebrism and stark contrasts between partially lit figures and dark backgrounds to dramatic effect some of his famous paintings are the calling of st mathew st thomas the conversion of st paul the entombment and the crowning of the christ his use of light and shadow was emulated by the caravaggisti the followers of caravaggio such as orazio gentileschi 1563–1639 artemisia gentileschi 159216523 2mattia preti carlo saraceni and bartolomeo manfredi annibale carracci 1560–1609 came from bologna where with his brothers agostino carracci 1557–1602 and ludovico carracci 1555–1619 he set up an influential studio or academy to train painters amongst their various joint commissions the carracci carried out the fresco decorations in the palazzo fava there followed a succession of important altarpieces in which the critical lessons of such artists as correggio titian and veronese are progressively developed and integrated by annibale within a unifying concept of naturalistic illusionism based in particular upon an unmannered design that is given optical verisimilitude through the manipulation of pure saturated colors and the atmospheric effects of light and shadow two of his famous paintings are ‘the assumption of the virgin mary’ and ‘a holy woman at the tomb of christ’ in the 1590s he went to rome to decorate the gallery in the palazzo farnese this ceiling became highly influential on the development of painting during the seventeenth century its exuberance and colour was picked up on by later baroque painters while the classicising aspects of its design disegno influenced painters who followed the more classical cannon other influential painters during this early period who influenced the development of baroque painting included peter paul rubens giovanni lanfranco and guercino whilst artists such as guido reni 3 and domenico zampieri known as domenichino pursued a more classical approach italian high baroque painting  editthe principal painter of the roman high baroque a period that spanned several papal reigns from 1623 to 1667 was pietro da cortona his baroque manner is clearly evident in paintings that he executed for the sacchetti family in the 1620s and the vault fresco in the palazzo barberini finished 1639 in rome during the 1630s cortona had a debate at the accademia di san luca the painting academy in rome with andrea sacchi a painter with classicising trends about the perceived differences between their painting styles the argument essentially concerned the number of figures in a painting and was couched in literary terms with cortona arguing for an ‘ epic ’ approach with an abundance of figures and sacchi making the case for ‘ tragedy ’ with fewer figures to convey the messages in a painting baroque painters such as cortona giovan battista gaulli and ciro ferri continued to flourish alongside the classical trend represented by painters such as sacchi and nicholas poussin but even a classicising painter like sacchis pupil carlo maratta was influenced in his use of colour by the baroque in the 1672 gian pietro bellori s ‘lives of the artists’ was published this promoted classical idealism in art so artists of this trend were included so was caravaggio but some of the leading artists of the seventeenth century were omitted such as cortona the sculptor gianlorenzo bernini and the architect francesco borromini later italian baroque painting  editmonumental ceiling frescoes mainly date to the latter part of the seventeenth century 4 some were dramatically illusionistic such as gaullis nave fresco 16749 in the church of the gesu and andrea pozzo s nave vault 16914 in santignazio both in

ricci 1659–1734 and giovanni battista piazzetta 1683–1754 but the greatest baroque exponent was gianbattista tiepolo 1696–1770 he is renowned for his light palette of colours used with fluid brush strokes and it is his frescoes rather than his canvases that exhibit these techniques most effectively 6 his works include frescoes at the palazzo labia and the scuola grande dei carmini in venice villa valmarana at vicenza villa pisani at stra works at the würzburg residence and the throne room at the royal palace of madrid an important centre of italian baroque painting was genoa many even from abroad came to the city to gain baroque artistic experience and later went to venice florence rome or other important baroque centres prolonged visits to the town were made by artists from other parts of italy and other countries including velázquez van dyck the french sculptor pierre puget bernardo strozzi and giovanni benedetto castiglione another italian city which had a vibrant baroque movement was milan the city hosted numerous formidable artists architects and painters of that period such as caravaggio 7baroque sculpture  editbernini s ecstasy of st teresa gian lorenzo bernini 1598–1680 was the leading sculptor of his day and the favorite artist of several popes and their relatives who gave him important commissions his ‘apollo and daphne’ in the villa borghese in rome illustrates how he could precisely capture in white marble the dramatic moment when daphne fleeing the pursuing sun god realizes she is metamorphosing into a laurel tree this ability to make expressive dramatic narratives in sculpture can also be seen in his ecstasy of saint teresa 1645–52 created for the cornaro chapel in santa maria della vittoria the blessed ludovica albertoni in san francesco a ripa in rome and st longinus in st peters he was also a fine sculptor of portrait busts he had a workshop which trained sculptors such as antonio raggi and ercole ferrata his main rival in sculpture was alessandro algardi melchiorre caffà 1635–1667 was the pupil of ferrata and executed ‘the ecstasy of saint catherine’ in s catherina da siena a monte magnapoli in rome before his early death filippo parodi 1630–1702 was an important sculptor from genoa francesco queirolo executed several sculptures for the cappella sansevero in naples including the technically demanding ‘deception
