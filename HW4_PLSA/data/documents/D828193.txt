here is what i did to solve this first you need to download and install the latest version of asus smart gesture smart gesture 4012 32bit smart gesture 4020 64bitif you already have this version then you may need to repair the installation go to settings  control panel  uninstallchange program  asus smart gesture  repair if everything is fine you should see asus touchpad in device manager notes asus support suggests to download and reinstall the atk driver first and then reinstall the touchpad driver download atk driver from here atk package 100050 32bit  atk package 100060 64bitif you have an asus t300la and the multitouch is not working uninstall asus smart gesture and install v228 from here 64bit then restart also if you are having issues with an asus zen book ux32vd use v228 error messages if you get the message “ another version of this product is already installed… “ you need to uninstall the old version and then install the new one if the installer throws the error “ source

update from reinstalling in windows 10 execute “show or hide updates” troubleshooter package after executing the troubleshooter select hide updates and then check the update named elan driver update for elan input device finally windows update will not override the asus smart gesture driver you can check this by searching for new updates the elan driver should not show up if you already have the elan driver installed and it is not listed on hide updates you need to uninstall this driver first and maybe restart too problems to uninstall asus smart gesture if you are not able to uninstall an

the device manager always upgrade the driver in an infinite loop hide updates works but it’s just a workaround ivan 11 august 2015 reply as you said hide updates solves the problem of course windows should stop sending elan updates m narayanan 11 august 2015 reply went to control panel windows update and after updation touchpad started working can be tried michiko 11 august 2015 reply i know it might be something minor to some but i cannot inverte my scrolling direction anymore the first day i update to win10 everything was working fine i just had to go and change the setting in the mouse option with that elan thingy then some update occured and everything was greyed out in the elan tab of the mouse option so i couldn’t access the touchpad setting anymore i tried to access it through the actual file in the program folders and it didn’t work either i tried to just uninstall elan altogether and i still don’t really have any option i can still scroll but the direction is fucked up and it really pisses me off anyone have an idea how to fix this maybe if i try reinstalling elan is there an option somewhere to block updates i don’t want because i think it was an update on the elan driver that fucked everything up i don’t care having it on my computer i just don’t want it to update ivan 11 august 2015 reply did you read the post update asus driver and use “ show or hide updates ” troubleshooter package to stop elan updates bb815 11 august 2015 reply i also had this problem which is now 99 fixed except that i can’t find a way to launch the smart gestures’ user interface where i can check or uncheck the boxes it offers to personalize the way i use the touchpad in the all programs list in the asus folder there’s nothing showing to launch smart gestures or touchpad anyone here know how to do it thanks ivan 11 august 2015 reply use “show hidden icons” click the arrow next to the notification area to show notification area icons there you will find asus smart gesture icon then just doubleclick it bb815 12 august 2015 reply thank you very much ivan for helping me and perhaps others find how to access the asus smart gesture settings you da manigor 13 august 2015

atk and smart gesture several times even using an external mouse but nothing is working the asus touchpad driver is installed but the multitouch doesn’t work it has been working for a while the first time i’ve upgraded to win10 and stopped working i don’t know when or why a downgrade to win81 has restore the multitouch it is working after a new upgrade to win10 until a windows update which

comments about asus t300la multitouch not working try to install v228 from here restart and then use the “show or hide updates” troubleshooter package to stop asus smart gesture updates let me know if this works or not since i don’t have a t300la to test it chris cook 17 august 2015 reply downgrading to smart gesture 228 on windows 10 seems to fix the issue of multitouch for my t300la i have performed the following 1 suppress the asus touchpad in the devices list 2 uninstall smart gesture 406 non reboot 3 install smart gesture 228 4 reboot and it’s working thank for your help chris cook 20 august 2015 reply smart gesture 40x worked fine the first time i upgraded my t300la from windows 81 to 10 so it seems there is something recently installed by windows update which conflicts with

could save a reboot and installed the new drivers immediately after uninstalling the old although the new ones apparently installed successfully the gestures weren’t recognized i had to uninstall both the old atk and smart gesture drivers reboot install the new drivers and reboot again for it to work on my q500a it’s not clear though what asus systems this will actually work for as the touchpad hardware may differ for my q500a the support site still shows no win 10 drivers had it not been for this site i would have assumed i was sol thanks again ivankathryn 16 august 2015 reply there are a lot of possible routes here so i was overwhelmed but i used three of your steps after i hooked up an external mouse 1 i downloaded and installed the asus touchpad driver from the top of this post 2

i’ve already tried but with same result… nothing any other tips topoldo 21 august 2015 reply i am in the same situation i tried many times both with 405 or 406 but it rolls back on programs  functionality apparently the package was not installed however in the control panel a white icon named “asus smart gesture”appears but if i click it it say that “there is no application” topoldo 6 november 2015 reply i had the opportunity to test extensively my notebook which is asus u30sd with windows 10 professional x64 for what the touch pad problem is concerned what i did was to install atk 10041 and asus smart gestures 409 before establishing any kind of connection to the net to avoid influences of microsoft updated drivers even in these conditions i was not able to install smart gesture which stopped to install at about 97 and the rollback so in my hands the only condition to make this model working was a install touch pad elantech v 115162 for windows 81 x64 b open the connection to internet and use immediately “hide updates” wushowhidediagcab c check “elantech touch pad driver” and “elantech other hardware driver” to avoid these 2 updates d optional drag  drop the icon of the touchpad from the ‘hidden’ notification area to the systray e if you click on it then you can configure all the possible asus smart gestures provided non many really in any case no icon is present in the control panel at difference of windows 7my 2 cents tip regards topoldo david 21 august 2015 reply touchpad on asus r501v was not working but after uninstalling asus smart gesture then

can’t tap to highlight anything more than a single word it used to be two light taps to highlight a word or three for an entire line but now unless i actually go to the corner of the touchpad and depress it like a button three times it won’t highlight anything more than the single word was just wondering if you had any suggestions as it’s surprisingly more of a pain than i’d have thought it would be thank you again though ivan 4 september 2015 reply it still works however i noticed that you need to tap in a slow way try to tap on a word three times slowly very slowly it’s weird i don’t

smart gestures program and restarted my laptop prior to running the setup file once i carried out the above steps and the restarted my laptop again my touch pad was working again with smart gestures hope this helps tye jason 7 october 2015 reply when i install the smart gesture a prompt says “there is a problem with this windows installer package a program run as part of the setup did not finish

solution to restore asus smart gesture works perfectly nownala 15 october 2015 reply thanks a lot for the useful tipsthomato 16 october 2015 reply hello thank you for your post i updated smart gesure and it now works however i think something is going wrong with this 409 version when i right click there is a sort of delay which freezes the cursor about 025 sec i think and it is impossible to move the cursor in this interval this is very annoying while browsing through opera mouse gestures ftw i always do “right click”  move down or left or down then right both in the same time and this delay ruins everything am i the only one with this issue is there a way to fix this thank you ivan 16 october 2015 reply thomato if your right click issue was not present on windows 8 you can try a previous driver like v228 link in the notes thomato 18 october 2015 reply thanks a lot for this link v228 works fine judy 17 october 2015 reply firstly thanks for providing the solution to resolve the smart gesture after win10 update the smart gesture is working now however the 2 fingers scroll is overly fast a single gesture brings page to the bottom such that it is useless and i can’t find where to slow it down i suspect it’s like the mouse roller setting where i have to change 1 click to scroll 1 line instead of 3 lines but i just cannot find it anywhere would appreciate any advise thanks kate 28 january 2016 reply judy go to settings  devices bluetooth printers mouse  mouse  touchpad change the “roll the mouse wheel to scroll” to the option of “multiple lines at a time” and move the “choose how many lines to scroll each time” to the far left and it will fix the problem buse 18 october 2015 reply thanks… this post solved my windows 10 scroll problem jingling 19 october 2015 reply

have an asus a55 laptop running 1064bit i’ve followed your advice and installed both latest apk and 406 drivers and all works fine for a time and then poof all disappearsi have been through unin  install numerous times and it always works perfectly for a time i checked and don’t have any other drivers installed though there is a hidcompliant mouse listed – i use a wireless mouse occasionallyany thoughts would be most welcome…ivan 28 october 2015 reply leslie when you say “all disappears” do you mean asus programs or drivers if you press windows start button and type “atk” do you see the program “asus onscreen display” which driver is listed in the device manager when your touchpad stops workingleslie 28 october 2015 replyhi ivan thanks for the prompt reply – greatly appreciated…when i say ‘disappears’ i mean just touchpad operation the programs etc remains but the pad just stops working i did have this happen recently when i was using it checked and found that asus devices update had loaded – i’ve stopped driver installation updates from windows and am hoping this will cure the matter i am beginning to suspect that it’s the above asus update that’s causing the problemyour thoughts if you have time…ivan 28 october 2015 reply yes from what you are saying asus drivers from windows update seem to be the cause as you already did install the version that works and then use the “show or hide updates” troubleshooter package to stop asus smart gesture updatesleslie 28 october 2015 replywill do and many thanks for running such a helpful siteall the best

my touch pad so i cannot disable it please help me control this touch pad that seems to have a mind of its own i followed the directions above and installed the packet before the driver update my touch screen is still working but i cannot access meaningful settings for the mouse ivan 8 november 2015 reply julia in the asus smart gesture settings there is an option on the tab “mouse detection” that says “disable touchpad when mouse is pluggedin”  help  is that what you are looking for julia 22 november 2015 reply no i need to turn off tapping there are times i use an external mouse and times i don’t in a mobile situation i drive a lot in my business and i use mapping programs extensively sometimes the mouse gets moved by an animal or hard braking and i cannot reach it do i take out the transponder and risk losing it to make the mouse work again i don’t thinks so i need to turn off tapping when typing like i am now the pads of my palms under my thumbs move the mouse around and at times they tap and it brings up additional screens and has been known to change settings because it selects things it shouldn’t i simply need to turn off the tapping it is the first thing i do with any computer i use or work on how do we turn off tapping ivan 23 november 2015 reply julia that’s easy go to asus smart gesture settings explained in the post and uncheck “select” under “one finger”

november 2015 reply i have an asus r500v k55vm when i first got it it came with windows 7 and the touchpad was highly erratic after some time passed the problem healed itself probably through an update now that i have windows 10 installed my erratic touchpad is back i have tried all of these downloads and none of them are resolving this any suggestions miro 18 november 2015 reply doesn’t work on asus u32u installed latest version of atk 64bit couldn’t install latest smart gesture so i installed v228 as mentioned result – touch pad doesn’t work and also some keyboard keys like home delete left and right arrows … any idea or it will not work on this laptop and i have to downgrade back to w81 thanks ivan 18 november 2015 reply according to the support page the asus u32u uses the synaptics driver synaptics 162105 there is a video in which the user fixed twofinger scrolling with this driver synaptics 16390 let me know if it worked miro 19 november 2015 reply thank you a lot it works and i had this issue for quite some timei think that i had same driver on w8 but the older version from asus page didn’t work with w10 and i wasn’t clever enough to try to find newer version of same driver now i will be smarter in future with similar issues btw do you have also any idea about those “broken” keys i mentioned i’ve installed atk 41 thank you ivan 19 november 2015 reply i’m glad it worked i’m guessing but in the support page for your asus there is a “keyboard device filter utility” under “utilities” you could try that miro 19 november 2015i’ve installed this one already v1005 before and also tried it again now to make sure but it didn’t make any different is there possibility that there isn’t any way to fix this thanks ivan 19 november 2015miro as a last resort for your issue i think you should call asus support here are the phone numbers select your region on the left good luckleslie 19 november 2015 replyfrankly asus’s support sucks big time – and so does windows

reply very useful information which helped me restore full trackpad functionality of more importance to me the ability to disable the trackpad when i have a mouse attached after windows 10 update to version 1511 denis 22 november 2015 reply hello there first of all thank you very much your article looks helpful and full of handy tips but i have like “broken interface” story  you see everything started with my stupid idea to install remote link on pc because i thought smart gesture didn’t support that feature eventually remote control started working so i calmed down however today i made a reboot and noticed that my scrolling feature is not working i went to smart gesture and i saw the only tab – mobile the rest have gone it feels like remote link replaced the whole thing i struggled uninstalling and repairing or reinstalling newest version you provided but every time i finally reboot after installation it leads to the same result mobile tab only i can’t find anything related to remote link in order to delete it i am washing my hands and don’t know what to do please help it would be so damn good ivan 22 november 2015 reply there is no much information about remote link other than this faq i would try to uncheck the option “enable remote link on my pc” or use the “set all to default” you should also check if another asus program was installed by remote link also you could try to uninstall smart gesture and clean the windows registry with an utility like ccleaner denis 23 november 2015 reply dear ivan thanks for replying so fast it was a couple of minutes or so i did that sequence for 10 times or so but once it resulted in crashing to blue screen which happens now and on every time i try to installreinstall smart gesture or detach the screen yeah the detachable transformer so the only thing i came up with is pretty simple and radical – reseting this pc i know pretty foolish but it must 100 work doesn’t it will it recover to factory settings with smart gesture working version restored all the data is actually backedup in cloud so it doesn’t bother me thank you in advance p s is the license verification needed or will it simply check my bios for it if i had windows 81 previously on board ivan 23 november 2015 reply denis you can use the media creation tool from microsoft and select “upgrade this pc now” it will not change your apps and files and it could solve your issue dg 27 november 2015 reply i have a t300la and have been trying to work around these problems as a heads up i was able to use a newer 81 smart gesture driver version 3014 i think the only weird thing about the gestures is when you use the 3finger function upwards for the task manager the start menu also pops up i am hoping that maybe i can slowly move up the ladder and figure out a fix…eventually dgychelleh 29 november 2015 reply simply thank you thank you thank you joanna 29 november 2015 reply it worked showed all the errors you said but your instructions were

own an asus ux305fa i bought in march i started having twofinger scrolling issues recently so i called asus “support” this morning after spending over two hours on the phone with them with zero results the tech offered to transfer me directly to microsoft unfortunately i was transferred to a line that required an extension number which i didn’t have loleventually i found my way here and removed the elan driver ms was kind enough to share which conflicts with smart gesture i removed it and scrolling was much faster and smoother however i can’t use two finger scrolling in the start menu at all any thoughts tialou 11 december 2015 reply as it turned out another user with the same problem on an hp laptop had the same problem in the start menu the solution was to enable “scroll inactive windows when i hover over them” in the “mouse  trackpad” settings thanks for the other tips in this post they did improve twofinger scrolling overall rods 10 december 2015 reply ivan thank

asus x751l unfortunately is not working my laptop and my touchpad was fully working but yesterday my touchpad was off after that i reinstall atk package and smart gesture but the touchpad is not working the asus touchpad is not listed in device manager please help me gabor from hungary dean hutchins 28 january 2016 reply i have had these problems since day 1 with windows 10 – flip my laptop over to use it as a tablet and the keyboard goes off but not the touchpad was accidentally movingclicking the mouse with my leg… very frustrating – touchpad is extremely jumpy… to the point where it is almost unusable – fnf9 function did not disable the touch pad so anyway i searched forever and finally clicked on this site btw isn’t it ironic how we seem to click on the best site last i followed the steps listed for my os it fixed all my issues and it is better than normal now thanks a million igor 28 january 2016 reply perhaps this question has been asked but i have not found an answer this faq says the smart gesture can only be installed on pcs with click pad design in my g750jw model there is a physical button in the list of drivers for my model for windows 10 there is nothing but for windows 8 has a driver elan so what is better to install ivan 28 january 2016 reply igor it’s the first time i see that faq however asus smart gesture has several drivers internally and elan is one of them so you should still install smart gesture paulius 29 january 2016 reply hello i tried a lot of suggestion here but for me the problem is that i have this completely new asus zenbook ux305f and the driver has never been installed on this computer so i have nothing to uninstall but i still get the “there is a problem with this windows installer package…” error i reinstalled atk package and removed elan driver i tried revo uninstaller to make sure smart gesture was not installed already asus update does not tell me that i don’t have smart gesture driver can anybody help me mella 29

reply last week i bought an asus x555lab it came with windows 10 installed my touchpad works but smart gestures do not my plan is to follow this tutorial to enable smart gestures the question i need to ask before proceeding is do all recent asus laptop computers have this featurefunctionality i did find smart gestures and atk installed at a date far before i owned the computer but at no point have i been able to use or set up these features thank you for your post and thank you in advance for any insight you can give mona 2 february 2016 reply turn off the touchpad in the bios asus g74sx

i’m unable to disable the touchpad using the fnf9 combination or through the smart gesture software i’ve uninstalled the atk and old version of smart gesture as per your instructions and have reinstalled atk 100041 and smart gesture 4012 restarted and now do not have access to the smart gesture control centre it’s just not in the system tray or available through search any ideas how to proceed with this thanks ivan 4 february 2016 reply jon as the previous comments says you can turn off the touchpad in the bios if you need smart gesture check if version 228 works for you jon 9 february 2016 reply hey ivan i’ve installed 228 but still have the same issue have now disabled the touchpad in the bios as per your suggestion which serves the purpose in the short term but it would be great to actually resolved this issue properly thanks jon kat 5 february 2016 reply i installed the new one and scrolling for two fingers worked for three fingers however it did not i am hoping to

installed smart gesture it’s in my program filesmanman 6 february 2016 reply hi i always install smart gesture but i never get the icon in the systray perhaps any services need to be running for the smart gesture to work ivan 7 february 2016 reply check what happens if you go to “cprogram files x86asusasus smart gestureas tpcenterx64” and run “asus tplauncherexe”jony clay 6 february 2016 reply great solution man i was annoyed i couldn’t use the twofingers gesture for scrolling anymore but now it’s working properly i had to uninstall the previous version of asus smart gesture and reinstall the updated version and also uninstall elan — actually it still appears in the programs list and when i click uninstall nothing happens but it doesn’t appear on the show or hide updates troubleshooter and everything is working fine thanks for the helpalexandrua 8 february 2016 reply i have an asus x551ma windows x64 10 after upgrading to windows 10 everything was fine for 23 months but 3 days ago scrolling on the touchpad stopped working i installed latest atk package and smart gesture however after restarting i see “asus support device” in device manager instead of “asus touchpad” do not even started asus smart gesture no icon i tried to use the microsoft fix it tool to no avail then i tried the version of asus smart gesture v228 thank you indeed appeared as “asus touchpad” in the “mouse and other pointing device” but scrolling on the touchpad is very fast and three fingers does not work ivan please helpsabian 9 february 2016 reply thanks for the great information you explain everything really concisely and effectively even going into possible errorsproblems it’s easy to understand but also detailed which is a combination many help sites struggle with thanks emo ape 12 february 2016 reply i have a zenbook ux305fa and the solution that worked for me for the error “there is a problem with this windows installer package…” was to update the bios to the latest version after that i was able to install smart gesture paulius 13 february 2016 reply hi emo ape what version of bios you installed 211 that’s the latest one i have found but it was already on my zenbook ux305fa still having the problem emo ape 14 february 2016 reply hi pauliusyes it is 211 however you might want to try to install anyway because the install process first erases the bios and then installs the chosen version maybe that cycle is what you need not sure but i guess it is worth the try good luckpritesh 14 february 2016 reply thank you crazy that asus can’t fix it automatically yet skm0005 17 february 2016 reply it’s vivo book x202e windows 10 64bit that has “elan touchpad 15843” in programs  features but the driver for asus touchpad shows as “asus 100262” and there’s no touch issue nb asus smart gesture 405then is it ok to uninstall elan as perhaps unnecessary and turn off from update to avoid any future issue ivan 17 february 2016 reply yes you can uninstall the elan touchpad program since you already have smart gesture installed mircea 25 february 2016 reply thanks a lot it worked for me i have an asus n56v win10 anccelo 25 february 2016 replyfinalmente ho risolto sto cavolo di problema del mouse grazie milledexter 28 february 2016 reply i have the same problem of the pad and right click suddenly not working what i did is uninstall the asus smart gesture using the microsoft fix it tool restart my computer and then for any reason i still have the asus smart gesture installed however it is working properly with no problemms anonymous 29 february 2016 reply thanks a lot worked perfectlysam 1 march 2016 reply i am having an issue that i believe is separate but related to smart gesture so hopefully you can help when i scroll with the touchpad there is some ‘momentum’ in which it continues scrolling for a bit after i remove my fingers from the touchpad then slows and stops the problem is that i often use ctrltab and ctrlshifttab to switch between tabs if i do this while the scroll still has some momentum the browser interprets it as ctrlscroll and zooms inout depending on the direction i’m scrolling i think the scrolling momentum is a feature not a bug but it’s super inconvenient i’d rather not turn off twofinger scrolling altogether but can’t find a setting to just turn off the momentum do you know of any fix to this or alternative driver package i have a zen book ux305fa thanksivan 2 march 2016 reply sam i was able to reproduce your issue i tested the latest smart gesture on chrome and firefox and both have the zoom issue i think it is indeed a bug it should stop sending touchpad actions i would like to know how is this handle in laptops from other brands ryan 8 january 2017 reply sam it’s been ten months so hopefully you’re solved your problem by now the fix i found was to install an auto hot key script that runs on startup and disables ctrlzoom in all applications1 download and install auto hot key 2 create a new auto hot key ahk file edit the script by rightclicking on the file and choosing “edit” 3 leave all the automatically generated text at the top beneath it add this textwheel downreturn wheel upreturn max hotkeys per interval 10004 save the file and make a shortcut to it 5 put the shortcut in your startup items folder so it always runs at startup hope this helps chris 2 march 2016

windows update and it works perfectly every time this time though it doesn’t seem to i’ve uninstalled and reinstalled atk package removed the elan driver updated the touchpad driver and updated smart gesture to 4018 but still whenever i scroll the smart gesture center sends my cpu usage into the stratosphere massively slowing down my system no small feat as it’s an i7 processor any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated thanks for you time as always loe 2 may 2017 reply i bought an asus pro and while i love the laptop i have some problems with scrolling it came with w10 and has the latest drivers but many times the cursor seems to get stuck or move very slowly despite the fact i have increased sensitivity and use enhanced precision while searching i found that another user in this thread said something about high cpu usage with smart gesture and so i checked it smart gesture can reach about 30 of cpu usage while scrolling twofinger so i’m thinking that the problem is not something with sensitivity etc but the fact that the cpu goes high have in mind that the notebook is a pretty strong one is this normal i’ve never seen it in another laptop should i use another smart gesture version or maybe try another driver any solutions should help alexander 16 april 2017 replythanks for make simple and actual asus support page  julie 16 april 2017 reply thanks for helping me
