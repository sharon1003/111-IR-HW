post hoc fallacy the post hoc ergo propter hoc after this therefore because of this fallacy is based upon the mistaken notion that simply because one thing happens after another the first event was a cause of the second event post hoc reasoning is the basis for many superstitions and erroneous beliefs many events follow sequential patterns without being causally related for example you have a cold so you drink fluids and two weeks later your cold goes away you have a headache so you stand on your head and six hours later your headache goes away you put acne medication on a pimple and three weeks later the pimple goes away you perform some task exceptionally well after forgetting to bathe so the next time you have to perform the same task you dont bathe a solar eclipse occurs so you beat your drums to make the gods spit back the sun the sun returns proving to you the efficacy of your action you use your dowsing stick and then you find water you imagine heads coming up on a coin toss and heads comes up you rub your lucky charm and what you wish for comes true you lose your lucky charm and you strike out six times you have a vision that a body is going to be found near water or in a field and later a body is found near water or in a field you have a dream that an airplane crashes and an airplane crashes the next day or crashed the night before however sequences dont establish a probability of causality any more than correlations do coincidences happen occurring after an event is not sufficient to establish that the prior event caused the later one to establish the probability of a causal connection between two events controls must be established to rule out other factors such as chance or some unknown causal factor anecdotes arent sufficient because they rely on intuition and subjective interpretation a controlled study is necessary to reduce the chance of error from selfdeceptionpost hoc parables andys story  for years i suffered a debilitating pain in my
