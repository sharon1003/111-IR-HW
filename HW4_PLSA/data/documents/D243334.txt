five boroughs located just west of long island is a city with 5 boroughs 59 community districts and hundreds of neighborhoods the five boroughs of new york new york city is one of the biggest cities in the world perhaps because it is actually made up of five smaller sections called boroughs at one time each borough had a completely separate government because it was considered a municipal corporation a municipal is a local governing body with its own set of governing officials in 1898 the separate governments were united as one the five boroughs kept their separate identities but became a part of new york city the five boroughs are manhattan brooklyn queens the bronx and staten island each borough has a borough president and the borough government operates out of a borough hall like a city hall that most people associate with city officials manhattan is the only exception the officials function out of the manhattan municipal building as of 1990 the borough president has very little power at one time each president had a voice in budget decisions within the city of new york it was argued in the u s supreme court that the practice was unconstitutional since each borough president got one vote the most densely populated boroughs got the same vote as the borough with the least amount of people it violated the 14th amendment the mayor of new york city makes all budget decisions for all the boroughs manhattan when people think new york they often think of manhattan the island of manhattan is the smallest of the five boroughs but has more people than the
