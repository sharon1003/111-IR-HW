prestressed concrete structures dr amlan k sengupta and prof devdas menon93 twoway slabs part i this section covers the following topics • • • •introduction analysis and design features in modeling and analysis distribution of moments to strips931 introduction the slabs are presented in two groups oneway slabs and twoway slabs the oneway slabs are presented in section 92 when a rectangular slab is supported on all the sides and the lengthtobreadth ratio is less than two it is considered to be a twoway slab the slab spans in both the orthogonal directions a circular slab is a twoway slab in general a slab which is not falling in the category of oneway slab is considered to be a twoway slab rectangular twoway slabs can be divided into the following types 1 flat plates these slabs do not have beams between the columns drop panels or column capitals usually there are spandrel beams at the edges 2 flat slabs these slabs do not have beams but have drop panels or column capitals 3 twoway slabs with beams there are beams between the columns beams are wide and shallow they are termed as band beams for long span construction there are ribs in both the spanning directions of the slab this type of slabs is called waffle slabs the slabs can be castinsitu castinplace else the slabs can be precast at ground level and lifted to the final height the later type of slabs is called lift slabs a slab in a framed building can be a twoway slab depending upon its lengthtobreadth l  b ratio twoway slabs are also present as mat raft foundation the following sketches show the plan of various cases of twoway slabs the spanning directions in each case are shown by the double headed arrows if the indian institute of technology madras prestressed concrete structures dr amlan k sengupta and prof devdas menona flat plateb flat slab bc twoway slab with beams figure 931ld waffle slab plans of twoway slabs the absence of beams in flat plates and flat slabs lead to the following advantages 1 formwork is simpler 2 reduced obstruction to service conduits 3 more flexibility in interior layout and future refurbishment twoway slabs can be posttensioned the main advantage of prestressing a slab is the increased spantodepth ratio as per aci 31802 building code requirements for structural concrete american concrete institute the limits of spantodepth ratios are as follows for floors for roofs 42 48 the values can be increased to 48 and 52 respectively if the deflection camber and vibration are not objectionable the following photographs show posttensioned flat plate and flat slab indian

analysis and design analysis the analysis of twoway slabs is given in section 31 is456  2000 under “flat slabs” the analysis is applicable to flat plates flat slabs and twoway slabs with deflecting indian institute of technology madras prestressed concrete structures dr amlan k sengupta and prof devdas menonbeams for twoway slabs with beams if the beams are sufficiently stiff then themethod based on moment coefficients given in annex d is456 – 2000 is applicable the direct design method of analysing a twoway slab is not recommended for prestressed slabs the equivalent frame method is recommended by aci 31802 it is given in subsection 315 is456  2000 this method is briefly covered in this section for flat plates and flat slabs the slab system is represented by a series of two dimensional equivalent frames for each spanning direction an equivalent frame along a column line is a slice of the building bound by the centrelines of the bays adjacent to the column line the width of the equivalent frame is divided into a column strip and two middle strips the column strip cs is the central half of the equivalent frame each middle strip ms consists of the remaining portions of two adjacent equivalent frames the following figure shows the division in to strips along one direction investigation is shown by the double headed arrow the direction under1 ms2 cs3 msl1l2 figure 933

an equivalent frame equivalent frame along column line 2indian institute of technology madras prestressed concrete structures dr amlan k sengupta and prof devdas menon figure 934elevation of an equivalent frame the analysis is done for each typical equivalent frame an equivalent frame is modelled by slabbeam members and equivalent columns the equivalent frame is analysed for gravity load and lateral load if required by computer or simplified hand calculations next the negative and positive moments at the critical sections of the slabbeam members are distributed along the transverse direction moments per unit width of a slab if the analysis is restricted to gravity loads each floor of the equivalent frame can be analysed separately with the columns assumed to be fixed at their remote ends as shown in the following figure the pattern loading is applied to calculate the moments for the critical load cases this is discussed later this provides the design figure 935simplified model of an equivalent frame the steps of analysis of a twoway slab are as follows 1 determine the factored negative mu– and positive moment mu demands at the critical sections in a slabbeam member from the analysis of an equivalent frame the values of mu– are calculated at the faces of the columns the values of muindian institute of technology madras prestressed concrete structures dr amlan k

for prestressing steel are same as that for oneway slab the profile of the tendons is selected similar to that for continuous beams than by tendon distribution the flexural capacity of prestressed slab is controlled by total amount of prestressing steel and prestress rather but the tendon distribution effects the load balancing some examples of tendon distribution are shown normal

devdas menon maximum spacing of tendons or groups of tendons should be limited to 8h or 15 m whichever is less here h is the thickness of the slab a minimum of two tendons shall be provided in each direction through the critical section for punching shear around a column the critical section for punching shear is described in section 94 twoway slabs part ii grouping of tendons is permitted in band beams a minimum amount of nonprestressed reinforcement is provided in each direction based on temperature and shrinkage requirement given as follows astmin  015 1000h for fe 250 grade of steel  012 1000h for fe 415 grade of steel the ducts for placing the individual strands are oval shaped to maintain the eccentricity reduce frictional losses and convenient placement of crossing ducts the ducts are not commonly grouted as the use of unbonded tendon is not detrimental in buildings the following photo shows the ducts for the prestressing tendons and the nonprestressed reinforcement in a twoway slab as per is456  2000 clause 26521 the minimum amount of reinforcement astmin in mm2 for unit width of slab is nonprestressed reinforcement oval shaped duct for prestressing tendon figure

and analysis the features in modelling and analysing an equivalent frame are discussed gross section versus cracked section for determining the stiffness of a slabbeam member the gross section can be considered in place of the cracked section this is to simplify the calculation of moment of inertia of the section equivalent column the actual column needs to be replaced by an equivalent column to consider the flexibility of the transverse beam in the rotation of the slab the portions of the slab in the ms rotate more than the portions in the cs because of the torsional deformation of the transverse beam column in the following figure the size of the arrows qualitatively represents the rotation of the slab note that the rotation is higher away from thec2c1upper columnh transverse beam
