see how close the numbers that actually fell are to the projection modelwe know michigan plays an honest gamewe also now know sum 13 will fall way more then sum 2 in a random distribution you have to have the bell curve we know there are more numbers adding up to 13 than 2  i will tie it all together i promise i have an associates degree in quality control spc or statistcal process control is what i did for 17 years until i got an exciting job in a market placeanyway this process is used in manufactoring to monitor specs on things like pistons brake parts  everythingso i know if 002 falls 47 times somethings wrongyou dont have to do the extensive tracking that i do  i just want you to understand the why i pick my numbers by the sums most of the sums i play will be between 5 and 22 the rest i ignore just narrowed my playing field again if i miss 002 no big deal i get most of my best hits on sums 10 thru 20 be back later with more let this sink in prep pray and stay out of the

but there more to it i start new charts every 30 draws and i use the last 10 draws for my new chart this is where knowing what fell and whats due comes in handy you get a feel for the numbers that you
