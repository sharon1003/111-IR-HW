years i have access to a 1998 chevy vortec 350 code name l31 i am wondering if this motor is a good base to start building upon any suggestions would be greatly appreciated post replytuffnuff moderator posts 7841joined 1209posted 030611 0945 amyes by all means get it if the price is right copypaste the vortec 5700 l31 is a v8 truck engine displacement is 57 l it is the last production generation i smallblock from chevrolet the cylinder heads feature combustion chambers very similar to those of the lt1 v8 but without the reverseflow cooling as such the l31 head is compatible with all older smallblocks and is a very popular upgrade it offers the performance of more expensive heads at a much lower cost it does however require a specific intake manifold a vortec head has four bolts attaching the intake manifold as opposed to the traditional six bolts per head the l31 was replaced by the 53 l 5300 lm7 the 2002 model year was the final year for the l31 57 l small block v8 whose origins date back to 1955 the vortec 5700 produces 255 hp 191 k w to 350 hp 261 k w at 4600 rpm and 330 ftlbf 448 n·m to 350 ftlbf 475 n·m of torque at 2800 rpm it is currently being produced as a crate engine for marine applications and automotive hobbyists as the ramjet 350 with minor modifications when the flag drops the bull t stops p engineer engine builder post reply1967c10i love my chevy chevetteposts 2joined 0311posted 030611 1015 amthats really god news i can get the motor for 30000 the seller also wants to sell me a comp cams thumpr cam and full roller valve train rpm airgap manifold double roller timing chain all from comp cams and a msd hei distributor msd 6a with an edlebrock 1405 600cfm carb all for 150000 does all this seem sound for now i plan to keep the bottom end stock and the heads stock but with the bee hive springs locks and roller tips am i on the right track with this the motor will eventually go into a 1967 chevy c10 pickup post replytuffnuff moderator posts 7841joined 1209posted 030611 1136 amall sounds good except the carb will be about 100 cfm short to feed your combo when the flag drops the bull t stops p engineer engine builder post reply

pmsorry about not responding sooner for some reason i could not log on my current user name i had to reregister in answer to your question i have the tr283 thumpr cam i was wondering if a holley 33109 750cfm carb with vacum advance would work for my application since someone posted that i was about 100 cgm short using an edelbrock 1405 600 cfm carb post replychevelle83i mow my lawn and find chevys posts 2280joined 1109posted 030611 1015 pmthe eddy 600 will work just fine it will just leave some power on the table as far as maximum power is concerned but eddy makes a 750 too the holley will be good as well post reply pontiacman2moderator posts 8956joined 0908posted 030711 0713 amok if i looked upthe right cam it has a 513498 lift and with work but will leave some power on the table also if using factory vortec heads you will need to have the guide bosses machined for proper clearance yes the holley 750 3310 willl work very well with this setup for peak performance but if peak performance is not a concern the edelbrock 600 will be ok professional hiperformance engine builder post reply67c10i love my chevy chevetteposts 9joined 0311posted 030711 1036 ami had no idea the guide bosses would require reworking for this application i contacted comp cams about this they informed me that their setup would not require more work on the heads i tend to trust you guys a little more beacause you folks live and breathe horsepower the kit the guy is trying to sell me comes with bee hive springstitanium locks push rods roller tips and roller rockers and the cam the other question i have for you guys is what should the timing be set to the car came equipped with fuel injection there seems to be no specs when using a carbd setup post reply pontiacman2moderator posts 8956joined 0908posted 030711 1143 amok the clearance issue on factory vortecs is the guide to retainer clearance they are only good to a max of 450 lift professional hiperformance engine builder post reply pontiacman2moderator posts 8956joined 0908posted 030711 1150 amthis leads us to valvesprings which require the most attention in a performance application since this is an oem iron head gm designed the valve guide to also serve as the inside diameter id locating device for the valvesprings the guides large diameter acts like a sleeve that keeps the singlewire valvespring located  properly the guide is also machined at the top to mount a positivestyle 0560inchdiameter valveguide seal all of this conspires to limit total valve lift to a safe figure between 0420 and 0430 inch the limitation is the clearance between the bottom of the retainer and the top of the valveguide seal accommodating more valve lift requires modifications to the valvespring seat and valveguide areas of the head the best route is to increase the springseat diameter from the standard 125 inches to 1440 inches both comp and crane offer tools that use a valveguide arbor to position the cutter the comp cams cutter increases the springseat diameter while simultaneously reducing the outside diameter od of the guide boss the crane tool also cuts the valveguideseal diameter at the same time comp sells a separate tool that cuts a new guide seal and reduces the guide height to create additional retainertoseal clearance both cutters machine the top of the guide down to a 0530inch diameter which is the standard size for positivetype aftermarket seals this requires purchasing new valveguide seals since the factory uses a 0560inch guide to locate the seals another way to go is to have a machine shop cut the guide boss diameter to around 0760 inch and reduce the seal height and use either the crane h11 tool steel spring pn 99846 or the comp spring pn 981 once these machining operations have been completed you have the choice of several aftermarket valvesprings to match your cam profile these machining operations will produce enough clearance to allow between 0525 and 0550inch valve lift before running into valvespring coilbind given a 1440inch valvespring seat diameter comp and crane offer several single and dual springs that will work with the stock valves professional hiperformance

reply67c10i love my chevy chevetteposts 9joined 0311posted 030811 0235 pmthanks a bunch fellas you dudes are awsome i should have joined the forum a long time ago i will go ahead with the purchase and post the motor once im done with it post reply dave632i mow my lawn and find chevys posts 2253joined 0708posted 030811 0244 pmthats great the ls series motors are becoming very popular with the hot rod set as they become more and more available the price for mods has come down more too there was an 53 ls put in a 72 nova in the april issue of chp it ran 85981 na which is about 13401350 in the 14 this is very respectable performance and they claimed that the salvage yard motortrans plus the aftermarket electronics to make it work came to only 2500  support american cars stomp a rice car today
