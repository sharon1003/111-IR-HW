does a credit check lower your credit score credit qa”does a credit check lower your credit score”i get this question all the time and like all things in the credit score realm it depends sigh…there are a number of different reasons to run a credit check and thus the confusion but we’ll get to the bottom of it i promise checking your own credit will not lower your credit scorelet’s knock out the easy ones first if you’re simply checking your own credit via a free credit score website or via the ftc’s free credit report program your credit score will not be affected in any way this means it won’t go up or down these consumer credit reports and scores allow you to see what’s up with your credit history but pose no harm to you because you’re not actually seeking new credit at least not right then and there think about it why would you be penalized just for checking your own credit report andor score s that wouldn’t make any sense if anything you should be commended for keeping an attentive eye on your credit history related to that you have a right to order a free credit report every 12 months from each of the three major credit bureaus when you order one of these free credit reports it actually breaks up your credit inquiries into two separate buckets hard pull vs soft pull you may have heard the term “hard pull” and “soft pull”a “hard pull” refers to credit inquiries that actually affect your credit score those which are initiated by the consumer and involve new credit try to keep these to a minimum and definitely avoid them before shopping for a home loan a “soft pull” on the other hand is innocuous and includes credit reports you pull yourself or those pulled by an employer or an insurance company these are harmless and won’t do anything to hurt you or your credit in conclusion you shouldn’t worry too much about the effect of credit inquiries things like paying bills on time and keeping your existing balances low are much more important and impact your credit score to a much greater degree as long as you practice moderation you should enjoy a solid credit score tip review the credit inquiries on your credit report to ensure you recognize them all if you see anything that doesn’t look familiar you could be the victim of identity theft if you suspect anything contact the creditor you don’t recognize for further information inquiries shared with others hardthese inquiries are the ones that you initiated typically in order to get some kind of credit such as a credit card auto loanlease mortgage cell phone etc they appear on your credit report and are visible to other prospective creditors and employers if and when they pull your credit report put simply they’re visible because they affect your credit in one way or another and creditors need to see them to make subsequent lending decisions inquiries shared only with you softthe other section you’ll see is the inquiries that do not hurt your credit and are visible for you only as a record of activities for example if you sign up for credit karma or credit sesame which are free credit score providers inquiries will show up on your credit report each month but won’t count against you in any way you may also see credit inquiries from insurance companies if you got a few quotes recently again these do not affect your credit score because they do not involve credit of any kind any preapproved offers you qualify will also be soft inquiries meaning they don’t count against you and occasional checkups from existing creditors also fall into this category as do background checks from employers it should even say explicitly on the credit report that “the following inquiries do not affect your credit score” they’re just there to let you know that a company is actively pulling your records other considerations now suppose you already have a credit card open with a company and they want to keep tabs on you if they do a credit check just to see how things are going in your life it won’t lower your credit score why because you didn’t initiate the request and you’re not actively looking for new credit they’re simply checking up on you the same is true of companies researching your credit profile and subsequently sending you socalled preapproved or prescreened offers it won’t hurt your credit score in all these instances you did nothing to prompt the credit check so you won’t be penalized in any way similarly if you apply for a job and your potential employer orders a credit report it won’t lower your credit score because no new credit is at stake they simply want to check out your financial background so again it won’t affect your credit score these types of inquiries do not hurt your credit score requests made by you for your credit report andor credit scores promotional inquiries made by lenders and credit card issuers to send preapproved offers credit checks initiated by insurance companies credit pulls from prospective employers to check your background existing account reviews credit card issuers check up on us from time to timethe only time your credit score could drop as a result of a credit check is when you apply for new credit examples include applying for any type of loan such as a mortgage auto loan auto lease a new credit card or an increased credit line with an existing card or loan these are the only instances when a credit check will lower your credit score as new credit or inquiries for new credit pose new risks regardless of how great of a borrower you’ve proven to be in the past in the eyes of creditors consumers who are actively seeking new credit pose a greater risk of default of course the stronger your credit profile the less impact these dare i say harmful credit checks will have on your credit score as a rule of thumb the more hard credit inquiries you have in a short period of time the more your score will drop so exercise moderation how long do inquiries stay on credit reports a reader once asked me “do credit inquiries ever go away” although there seems to be much dispute about this credit inquiries only remain on your credit report for two years but fico scores only factor in inquiries as part of their scoring methodology for the previous 12 months in other words even if they are present on your credit report they’re only meaningful from a creditscoring perspective for a single year the rest of the time they just serve as additional information to you and your creditors additionally fair isaac the founder of the fico score has improved its scoring model to distinguish rate shopping versus a consumer attempting to open a large number of different accounts the latter borrower would probably see their credit score drop because a series of new credit accounts tends to lead to greater credit risk but a consumer with multiple inquiries related to the same type of loan within a 1445 day shopping period will generally see no adverse effect to their credit score as only one inquiry should be counted against them in fact auto mortgage and student loan inquiries that occur 30 days prior to scoring don’t affect your fico score and all such inquiries that occur within a 45day window are treated as a single inquiry this isn’t a mix and match deal though…for example think of a person who shops with multiple lenders to obtain a home loan fico knows it can be a long process and doesn’t want to discourage consumers from comparison shopping so they won’t count all those inquiries against you separately how credit inquiries can hurt your credit score as alluded to above a credit inquiry can lower your credit score but the impact is generally rather inconsequential typically a single credit inquiry will take less than five points off your credit score but this can range depending upon the type of inquiry and the overall makeup of your credit profile if you have a limited credit history one inquiry will have a greater impact than a consumer with a solid 10year credit profile but a large number of different types of inquiries in a short time period can be a red flag for potential creditors and could result in a noticeably lower credit score and even if you do have a good credit score a large number of inquires in a short time span could cause a creditor to decline your application for fear that you’re getting in over your head that said don’t fret too much about pulling your own credit report every now and then as not all credit inquiries count against you if you order a credit report online from any of those “free credit report” sites it won’t be factored into your score because it’s not an application for credit it’s simply a checkup and doesn’t signal a greater credit risk for the consumer same goes for employee credit pulls and preapproved credit offers as a rule of thumb if the credit pull doesn’t involve new credit or wasn’t initiated by you it shouldn’t affect your credit score author colin robertson colin created this
