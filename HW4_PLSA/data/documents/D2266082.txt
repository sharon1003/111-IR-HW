bearing up what you need to know before you buy that next set of engine bearingstweet not all engine bearings are the same and price is not the best way to decide which bearings are best for your application a quick jog through this story will answer many unanswered questions story and photos by jeff smith it was a great day on the dyno our 502ci bigblock chevy was singing it had just picked up a solid 50 hp from a cam and valvespring swap and power was about to break into the 600 hp range we had previously run this engine with a supercharger and it had made an awesome 830 hp the next step was to tune this new normally aspirated package before bolting the blower back on the motor that’s when it all went sour a backup run on the dyno lost 40 hp and we knew something was wrong a quick check revealed shiny metal bits in the oil we’d lost at least one bearing – maybe more we cut the oil filter open and our suspicions were confirmed it was time to take the engine apart the teardown revealed that number two main had failed this was the second bigblock that we had worked on in less than a year that had killed number two main bearing and we began to suspect an assembly issue but a discussion with bearing expert bill mc knight of mahle clevite revealed some information that was so interesting and important for parttime engine builders that we felt we had to pass this along while we knew there was a difference in price between production style “p” bearings and their high performance cousins we didn’t know the whole story and if you build engines this is important information beyond just the fact that better bearings are more expensive and worth the extra investment we also learned new information about when production bearings are worthwhile – and when they aren’t the only right way to assemble an engine with new bearings is to not only choose the correct bearings but also spend the time to carefully measure everything with precision tools there are several different types of engine bearings and choosing the right one can make all the difference in the case of our bigblock this was a brand new zz502 crate engine from chevrolet performance rated at 500 hp we had bolted on a supercharger and pushed the power past 830 hp in performing our rat autopsy we learned that these crate engines are assembled using production style aluminum bimetal bearings the shell is steel but the bearing material itself is an aluminum alloy according to mc knight nearly all production line engines are now fitted with aluminum alloy bearings not just because they are inexpensive but also because european laws ban the sale of production car engines with lead alloy bearings this is understandable as it eliminates the potential for scrapped engine parts putting lead into landfills when engines are built along production engine assembly lines these are the bearings that are often employed mc knight said there is nothing wrong with using bimetal bearings in the zz502 application as long as the power remains around 600hp or less however when we pushed our engine past 830 hp crankshaft deflection even with the zz502’s forged steel crank can cause contact with the main bearings scat crankshaft owner tom lieb told us that when bigblock chevy bearing failures occur he most often sees them in mains 2 and 4 we also spoke with renowned engine builder jon kaase about this phenomenon and he believes this may be due to where the thrust bearing is located on a bigblock chevy because the thrust is located in the rearmost position leverage from increased power levels tends to load the number 2 main bearing to reinforce his point kaase points to the bigblock ford that rarely has main bearing problems kaase says this is because the ford places the thrust bearing in the center main which shortens the leverage arm and therefore reduces the bending moment that is applied to the crankshaft at high horsepower levels he says that he often sees production 429460 fords with 2bolt mains make over 900 hp with no problems regardless of why bigblock chevys tend to do this we wanted to know more about the difference between bimetal aluminum bearings and their high performance trimetal cousins we initially thought that aluminum bearings must be softer than trimetal bearings but the truth is exactly the opposite according to mc knight bimetal bearings have virtually the same load carrying capacity as trimetal versions but the aluminum alloy is much harder this is intentional because bimetal bearings are engineered to last decades in a production engine this durability is a great asset but it comes at a price for highoutput applications mc knight says engineers design the bearing softer to “wipe” when extreme loads push through the oil film between the bearing and the crankshaft journal when this wiping occurs the softer trimetal bearing will absorb the load and the bearing material will deflect or wear off harder bimetal bearings are less forgiving instead a portion of the bimetal bearing face can peel away and begin a microscopic microwelding process between the bearing and the crank journal microwelding can be described as high heat and load removing small bits of aluminum from the bearing surface once this process begins the crank quickly peels away portions of the bearing this is what we saw with the number two main the metal immediately progresses into adjacent rod bearings and is immediately destructive it’s important to mention here that this is not a condemnation of the zz502 crate engine or its aluminum bimetal bearings the bimetal bearings in that engine will last a long time at nearstock power levels chevy has tested this engine for durability and found the bearings are fine at that power level we pushed that engine over 50 percent past its intended power levels and abused it beyond its intended capabilities had we understood the risk with bimetal bearings we would have replaced them with trimetal versions and our sources all agree that the engine would have survived with no problem with perhaps only a mild wiping of the number two main rod and main bearings can be condensed into two basic categories – production style bimetal aluminum versions left and the more performance oriented trimetal bearings constructed of a leadcopper alloy with a very thin leadtin overlay right these different bearings may appear to perform the same job but their performance characteristics are completely different there are many companies making both stock replacement and high performance bearings with the major players being mahleclevite daido federalmogul speedpro and king among others in talking with king bearing’s ron sledge we discovered that king makes three different styles of bimetal bearing the standard replacement bimetal bearing uses an am suffix the si suffix bimetal employs 4 percent silicon and is suitable for daily driven high mileage engines and mild performance applications sledge said silicon works as a polishing agent for nodular cast crankshafts if you were to look at the bearing journal surface of a cast crankshaft under a microscope it is full of peaks and valleys nodular cast cranks contain tin ferrite pockets that are ruptured during grinding and polishing causing the formation of jagged edges the silicon in the si and hp materials acts as a polishing agent to round off the jagged edges the king hp suffix bearing is the performance version bimetal and could be used in a smallblock chevy for example making 550 hp or less according to sledge using the hp bimetal bearing will be an advantage in conformability above this power level you would want to use a trimetal bearing according to scat crankshaft owner tom lieb he really likes the king si bimetal bearing for nonracing mild performance cast cranks applications because with these bearings he has had far fewer problems than other bimetal bearings as soon as he converted to the king si bearing his bearingrelated crank issues dropped nearly to zero trimetal bearings so what is a trimetal bearing this style of bearing is not really new it has proven its design as an ultrahigh performance bearing for decades starting with a steel back for stability the base is a copperlead alloy as the second layer with a very soft electroplated leadtin alloy as the top layer this is a generic description with each company modifying this basic layout to a specific formula the two upper layers consist of very soft materials that will deform and accommodate deflection in the rotating journals that naturally occur in highlystressed engines this is important because during engine operation what keeps bearings alive is a thin film of oil that creates a hydrodynamic wedge of lubrication that both lubricates and cools the bearing while softer bearings are more likely to absorb crank deflection this comes at the price of a shorter overall lifespan compared to a bimetal bearing but in the case of high output performance engines their lifespan between rebuild is far shorter than a traditional production engine that could easily be asked to support 200000 miles if you are dealing with bearings from an unknown source many factory aluminum bearings are stamped with an “a” or “au” prefix that quickly informs you this is an aluminum or bimetal bearing as you may already know trimetal bearings come in many different and specific forms crankshaft companies have known for years that creating a large fillet radius between the crank journal and the vertical portion of the counterweight increases the crank’s strength this narrows the bearing surface area slightly requiring a narrower bearing most bearing companies refer to this style with an n somewhere in the part number the most common application for n bearings is for connecting rods these bearings come with a chamfer on one side that dictates an upper and lower marked insert this is critical because if these positions are reversed an upper bearing shell installed in a rod cap for example the chamfer will be located on the wrong side and the 90degree edge could contact the fillet area of the crank journal while this is rarely fatal to the bearing it’s an indication that the engine builder was not paying attention other important variations on the traditional trimetal performance bearing include under and oversize options that allow the builder to customize bearing clearances even halfshells can be used to make very slight bearing clearance adjustments coated bearings are another option available to the engine builder for example speedpro offers a duro shield coating that is only 00003inch thick but offers an added layer of protection this polymer coating has the ability to absorb oil to improve lubricity and potentially reduce friction there is far more information on bearings coatings and different chemistries relating to bearings but our main focus here is to identify the difference between trimetal and bimetal bearings you can decide whose product works best for your application talking with professional engine builders will often point you in a specific direction clearances the classic recommendation for rod and main bearing clearance really hasn’t changed much in the last 40 years the standard rule is 0001inch per one inch of journal diameter this is a standard that still works but with advances in oil quality and viscosity these recommendations are becoming more specific the most important factor to remember when establishing bearing clearances is to match your intended oil viscosity to a bearing clearance if the engine is already assembled then you are forced to choose the viscosity that best fits the existing clearance king bearing’s ron sledge has created a chart that lists clearance recommendations based on engine oil viscosity this is a generic chart and also refers to main bearing journal diameters less than three inches in diameter generally journal diameters larger than three inches require more clearance examples would be olds or pontiac engines with the larger main bearings these are speedpro performance trimetal high performance rod and main bearings some people mistakenly think there is something wrong with these bearings because of their odd coloration federalmogul does not flash coat its trimetal performance bearings which is why the bearing looks like this this is completely normal appearance for a trimetal bearing oil viscosity plays an important role in bearing clearance because tighter clearances will demand a thinner oil in order to provide the necessary protection another way to think about bearing clearance is to consider the three critical aspects of clearance bearing load capacity oil flow and oil temperature load capacity generally peaks with tighter clearances but minimal clearance reduces oil flow generally expressed in gallons per minute or gpm tighter bearing clearances also increase localized oil temperature since the oil flow has been reduced so clearances become a balancing act between all three components this generally falls as is indicated in king’s bearing clearance chart around 00020 to 00025inch as an acceptable clearance for street engines with the trend of high quality thinner viscosity race oils there is a solid case to be made for tighter clearances that can take advantage of slight power gains from reduced windage in the crankcase from less oil but also improved power from reduced pumping losses due to the lighter viscosity an oil viscosity test performed by steve brule at westech performance a few years ago found that high quality 0w20 race oil produced an average of 3 hp more compared to a straight 30w street oil and an average pressure drop of nearly 8 psi compared to a 20w50 race oil ironically the average power between the 0w20 and 20w50 oils was a mere 05 hp despite the difference in pressure so gains are small when contemplating power increases through oil viscosity oil pressure is another aspect of engine performance that is changing the old standby of 10 psi per 1000 rpm of engine speed is now considered to be outdated according to sledge nascar engines are now running 9000 –plus rpm with oil pressure in the 40 psi range performance bearings come in multiple sizes for performance applications often a 1x bearing can be used to add 0001inch additional clearance a 1 bearing will reduce the clearance by 0001inch when mixing shell halves for custom clearances always place the thicker shell half in the loaded side of the housing in the case of rod bearings this would be in the connecting rod side over and undersize bearings halves should only be used in conjunction with a standard bearing half never combine a 0001 with a 0001 half if you think about it pressure is just the indication of resistance to flow pressure is important but it’s clear that 50 psi for most street performance applications would be more than sufficient this also means that oil pressure at idle does not have to be 40plus psi at idle the engine only has to make enough power to spin itself and any attending accessory drives with this minimal load oil pressure at 10 to 20 psi would be more than sufficient this is why nearly all oe manufacturers are switching to 5w20 or 5w30 oil for production engines thinner oil requires less power and therefore results in better fuel economy and power we once asked kaase what the typical oil pressure was on an 800ci pro mod style mountain motor kaase says he gears his dry sump oil pressures for peak rpm and they fall wherever they may at idle often this means the engines may only make 5 psi of pressure at idle which he feels is more than sufficient conclusions we’ve only barely touched on several aspects of engine bearing applications and usage but perhaps we’ve piqued your interest and you can take the next few steps in determining what’s best for your specific application it should be obvious that the selection of a main or rod bearing for a dailydriven smallblock is going to be quite different than one for a 9000 rpm nhra competition eliminator drag race engine but at least now it’s clear that not all bearings are the same king bearing oil clearance chart oil viscosity rod bearing clearance main bearing clearance20w  5w20  – 00021  0002030w  5w30 00021 – 00026 00020 – 0002540w  10w40 00026 – 00031 00025 – 0003050w  20w50 00031 –  00030 – often after measuring a complete set of eight rod bearings you may find a set that is a little tighter clearance and one that’s a little looser than you’d like we have found that merely switching the loose for the tight and measuring again will bring both tolerances in closer to the desired clearance this can be attributed to minor housing bore differences and different crush characteristics between the rods if you look closely at a high performance set of rod bearings the inserts may be marked “upper” and “lower” this is because the bearing insert has been narrowed on one side to clear the radius against the cheek of the crank be careful to always place them in their proper position to prevent the bearing from rubbing on the crank fillet radius when inserted properly the narrow side of the bearing will be on the same side as the chamfer on the rod and cap when customizing bearing clearances you can mix halfshell thicker or thinner bearing halves to establish the desired clearance for example to decrease rod clearance by 00005inch use a 1 0001 less clearance in the rod and then measure the clearance again use only the same style bearings when mixing half sizes and never mix manufacturer bearings in the same housing bore most leading bearing companies now offer ¾ groove style main bearings this extends the bearing’s oil groove from the upper bearing past the parting line to ensure a better supply of oil to the loaded portion of the bearing in the cap full groove bearings should never be used in a performance application because this reduces bearing surface area and increases the load on the remaining portion of the bearing only measure bearing clearance 90 degrees to the parting line all engine bearings are designed with additional clearance closer to the bearing parting line this taper prevents bearing movement due to cap walk that could potentially wipe oil off the crank journal anytime a set of rod bolts are pressed into place the rods should be resized to accurately maintain not only the proper inside diameter but also concentricity changing from bolts to studs in main bearings will also change the clearance due to different load characteristics changing to main studs often does not require line honing but you should measure the clearance as it could change there are some enthusiasts who will argue this point but we don’t consider plastigage to be a precision measurement device this tool can be used when nothing else is available but in our experience this tool is extremely inconsistent with variations of well over 0001inch compared to using a calibrated dial bore gauge and a micrometer this is the aluminum main bearing we pulled from our bigblock chevy engine when it began to destroy the bearings note how a portion of the bearing is severely scratched this is where the aluminum alloy was pulled away by the crank that’s the metal we found in the oil a softer trimetal bearing would have been worn down but would not have dumped bearing material into the oil – unless it was severely distressed – at which point you have other
