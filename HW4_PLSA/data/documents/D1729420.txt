hearing loss references for conductive hearing loss the hearing loss entitlement eligibility guideline will apply to claims where the 2006 edition of the table of disabilities would apply refer to the tod transition protocols an application for entitlement for a hearing loss should properly be submitted as hearing loss regardless of the type s of loss please note entitlement should be granted for a chronic condition only for vac purposes chronic means that the condition has existed for at least 6 months signs and symptoms are generally expected to persist despite medical attention although they may wax and wane over the 6month period and thereafter definition there are two general types of hearing loss sensorineural sometimes called perceptive and conductive hearing loss sensorineural hearing loss is hearing loss due to a defect in the cochlea or the auditory nerve whereby nerve impulses from the cochlea to the brain are attenuated conductive hearing loss means the partial or complete loss of hearing due to defective sound conduction of the external auditory canal or of the middle ear a mixed hearing loss is a combination of sensorineural and conductive revised diagnostic standard updated february 2012for vac purposes normal hearing exists where there is decibel loss of 25 d b or less at all frequencies between 250 and 8000 hertz for vac purposesa hearing loss disability exists when there is a decibel sum hearing loss dshl 100 d b or greater at frequencies of 5001000 2000 and 3000 hz in either ear or 50 d b or more in both ears at 4000 hz for vac purposes a nondisabiling hearing loss exists when there is decibel loss greater than 25 d b at frequencies between 250 and 8000 hertz inclusively and this loss is not sufficient to meet vac s definition of a hearing loss disability a hearing loss disability can be considered to be partially caused by service factors when there is decibel loss greater than 25 d b evident on the discharge audiogram in at least one of the frequencies between 250 and 8000 hz inclusively and a hearing loss disability is established after discharge the presence of a hearing loss and the type of hearing loss may be determined from an audiogram diagnosis of the type of hearing loss may be made by a clinicallicensedcertifiedregistered audiologist or a qualified medical practitioner the cause of the hearing loss cannot be determined from an audiogram alone the history from the patient the physical examination and relevant test results must be considered along with the audiogram findings it is preferred that audiograms submitted to the department for entitlement or assessment purposes be performed by a clinicallicensedcertifiedregistered audiologist however audiograms submitted from other sources such as hearing instrument specialists his physicians or nurses may be considered by vac if they meet the following standards for an audiogram to be considered acceptable by the department the following criteria should be met the hearing should be tested in both ears at 250 500 1000 2000 3000 4000 6000 and 8000 htz air and bone conduction values in both ears should be recorded speech reception thresholds srts for each ear should be recorded an indication of reliability of the audiogram should be indicated a narrative description of the test results is also welcomed psychogenic deafness may be conscious feigned or unconscious the diagnosis can usually be confirmed by sophisticated audiometric testing including corticalevoked response audiometry audiograms that do not meet the above standards should be considered by the adjudicator on a casebycase basis the determination of reliability is based on the interpretation of information provided on the audiogram the age of the audiogram and its consistency with previous audiograms it is important to note that the literature indicates that american audiometric data collected prior to 19691970 may be based on the asa standard as late as 1977 it was recommended that audiogram blanks be labelled as ansi or iso to ensure that all hearing levels in a report were actually ansi or iso hearing and deafness 4 th ed p 287 to convert asa hearing losses to isoansi levels the following decibels are added frequency decibels added125 9250 15500 141000 101500 102000 853000 854000 66000 958000 115anatomy and physiology sounds are collected by the external ear auricle and transmitted down the external ear canal to set the eardrum in motion the eardrum separates the canal from the middle ear with its 3 ossicles  malleus hammer incus anvil and stapes stirrup the eardrums vibrations are picked up and amplified by the ossicles and conducted to the cochlea organ of hearing the whole system from the auricle to the stapes is the conducting apparatus of the ear any abnormality in the system from wax in the ear canal to fixation of the stapes by otosclerosis can cause a conductive hearing loss conductive hearing loss is the result of sound waves not being transmitted effectively to the inner ear because of some interference in the external canal the ear drum the ossicular chain the middle ear cavity the oval window the round window or the eustachian tube in pure conductive hearing loss there is no damage to the inner ear or the neural pathway the ossicles vibrations are transmitted indirectly to the fluid in the cochlea movement of the fluid stimulates the cochleas hair cells they transmit electrical impulses along the auditory nerve of hearing to the brain the whole system from the cochlea to the auditory cortex in the brain is the sensorineural apparatus any abnormality in these structures such as  cochlear damage or acoustic neuroma can cause a sensorineural hearing loss as a general rule sensorineural hearing loss affects mainly the high tones and conductive hearing loss the low tones the rule is not invariable early menieres disease classically causes a low tone sensorineural hearing loss otosclerosis causes a conductive hearing loss that may affect the high tones as well as the low tones a complete audiogram shows hearing by both air and bone conduction in a conductive hearing loss hearing by bone conduction is normal hearing by air conduction is diminished the air conduction graph is therefore at a lower level in the audiogram than the bone conduction graph the gap between the two graphs is known as the airbone gap in a sensorineural hearing loss air and bone conduction are affected equally the two graphs are at approximately the same level there is no airbone gap in a mixed hearing loss air and bone conduction are both affected but the loss by air is more severe than the loss by bone the air conduction graph is lower than the bone conduction graph there is an airbone gap clinical features two common causes of sensorineural hearing loss prominent in pension medicine are noise and age these factors initially cause a high tone hearing loss which gradually spreads to other frequencies it may be difficult to determine whether noise age or a combination of the two is to blame to cause a hearing loss noise has to be loud enough and of sufficient duration the louder the noise the shorter the time it will take to damage hearing both a single intense sound and repetitive sounds can cause a sensorineural hearing loss the hearing loss may be temporary temporary threshold shift with complete recovery of hearing in a few hours to a few weeks or permanent a single intense sudden sound can damage the ear before the aural reflex can act ie where sound is generated in a shorter time than 44 Â± 11 milliseconds for repetitive sounds the contraction of the stapedial muscles is maintained when repetition occurs less than once a second there is a clear tendency for the ear to be more tolerant of noise at the low frequencies as opposed to the middle and higher frequencies the ear appears to be particularly vulnerable to frequencies in the range of 2000 to 4000 hz or even 6000 hz these frequencies are likely to be generated in industrial settings by various hammering stamping pressing shipping and rivetting operations and in other settings by gunfire explosions and some types of aircraft noise the loudness level or intensity of noise measured in decibels and the length of exposure are critical continued exposure to noise above 85 db over time will cause hearing loss according to the national institute for occupational safety and health 1998 the maximum exposure time on a single episode at 85 db is 8 hours and at 110 db it is one minute and 29 seconds noise levels above 140 db can cause immediate hearing damage frequency measured in cycles per second or hertz hz is also important as high frequency noise can cause more damage than lowfrequency noise examples of approximate decibel d b levels are as follows85 handsaw95 electric drill100 factory machinery105 snow blower110 power saw120 pneumatic drills heavy machines chain saw120 jet plane at ramp130 jackhammer power drill air raid percussion section at symphony140 airplane taking off150 jet engine taking off artillery fire at 500 feet163 rifle166 handgun170 shotgun characteristically the first sign of noise damage appears as a dip or notch at one of the higher frequencies usually 4000 or 6000 hz the notching configuration is not however always present for example it may be obliterated by the effects of aging or continued exposure to noise with continued noise exposure the hearing loss becomes permanent because of irreparable damage to the cochleas hair cells as exposure continues more hair cells are damaged and the hearing loss although remaining most severe in the upper frequencies extends to the lower frequencies above a certain intensity noise becomes explosive and causes blasttype injuries it may rupture the eardrum causing a conductive hearing loss if no further damage has been done the hearing loss may be temporary if the eardrum heals complete restoration to normal is possible the blast may damage or dislocate the ossicles of the middle ear causing a conductive hearing loss that may be permanent unless the ear is successfully operated upon the blast may also tear the sensitive part of the cochlea the organ of corti from its moorings causing a sensorineural hearing loss that is permanent and irreparable any combination of these injuries may occur so that the hearing loss may be conductive sensorineural or mixed pension considerations sensorineural hearing loss causes and  or aggravation the timelines cited below are not binding each case should be adjudicated on the evidence provided and its own merits exposure to at least one episode of acoustic trauma just prior to clinical onset or aggravation acoustic trauma means a condition of sudden aural damage resulting from shortterm intense exposure or a single exposure to loud noise such as that made at close quarters byfireworkssmall arms firegunfireartillery fireexploding grenades mines or bombsblast injury most literature does not specify the range of noise levels likely to occur with any of these types of explosions noise levels are probably well in excess of 120 decibels extremely loud noises can rupture the ear drum and damage the ossicles less intense acoustic trauma may produce ear pain or a sensation of burning temporary threshold shift permanent hearing loss and tinnitus the severity of the loss varies with the magnitude of the explosion and proximity to the blast there is evidence to support the notion that a single exposure to acoustic trauma may possibly be sufficient to induce a state of permanent threshold shift this is however considered an unlikely event unless there is objective evidence of concomitant middle ear damage such as a ruptured ear drum or bleeding from the ear canal exposure to noise other than acoustic trauma during or just prior to clinical onset or aggravation consideration must be given to variables including but not limited to the followinglevel of the noise hazardcontinuity of noise hazardduration of noise hazardpresence or absence of adequate ear protectionlocation of noise hazard eg

temporal bone may produce chronic infection which may result in conductive hearing loss conductive hearing impairment due to secretory otitis media following radiotherapy is a consequence well known to radiation oncologists published studies show conflicting results with damage occurring immediately or subsequent to the radiation hearing loss may improve or may be permanent there are a number of variables which confound the effects of radiation but it has been demonstrated to cause dryness and scaling of the skin of the external auditory canal leading to build up of debris which may result in conductive hearing loss cholesteatoma at the time of clinical onset or aggravation inability to obtain appropriate clinical management see introduction to entitlement eligibility guidelines medical
