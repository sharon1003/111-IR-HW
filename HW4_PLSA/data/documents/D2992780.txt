elder scrolls online maintenance or server issues the elder scrolls online servers will go down for maintenance at scheduled periods and of course problems will take place that weren’t planned on occasion server stability wouldn’t have been helped by elder scrolls online releasing on ps4 and xbox one following a pc launch but the developers did increase server capacity in preparation if you loved skyrim then you will almost certainly enjoy playing either as dragonknight nightblade sorcerer or templar in elder scrolls online this open world experience might be a problem for those hating the subscription model and even those that don’t like playing online instead opting for the skyrim offline experience elder scrolls online servers down or problems on thursday april 12 2018 when the

wait for someone to work out wtf is going on richard g • 7 months agohas anyone experienced issues after updating the august 28 release annie • 6 months ago getting kicked off and ps4 network issues sucks big time michael burchett • 7 months agoit use to be once a month then once a week i mean if your gonna say maintence once a week then 3 days later say its maintence and a update how about save us our time and money for those that pay for the plus and do the update at the same time you already have it down you know me and several others do have a job to work and bills to pay so it sucks the few days we get to play were spent waiting for maintence i just dont get what your teams doing to have this much maintence needed most big games like this do a 10 minute reboot for the serverstrashcache all the above to keep it clean every 24hrs and once a month unless something horrible goes wrong keeping a check on any debugs faulty formuals for your vocations damage healing balance tweaks should remain once a month since they take so long sven • 7 months ago amen will • 7 months ago i agree archisman chatterjee • 7 months ago got booted for being inactive was getting food and now i cant log into na servers eu woks fine but all my stuff is in na was in stonefalls last when i got booted ayame yashida • 7 months ago since the maintenance its been so laggygale mckaig • 8 months ago the servers are continuously going down every other day overloaded or faulty who can know the world map shows everyone having an issue all over the world and the response from eso is issues resolved at this time wow they cant even acknowledge that they have a problem that is a priority in the normal world recognizing that you have a problem johny proctor • 8 months ago played 535 hours then after an update   connection to server timed out    tried all and still no joy but it works on my brothers computer in the next room   help alliyah brown • 8 months ago same here been playing for almost a year now constantly get time out errors its a nightmare to switch between characters yet my daughter an log in no problem fixed blade123 • 9 months ago as ive seen others mention my main issues are 1 lag time 2 being kicked offline all too often 3 inability to finish certain quests due to glitches cold winds skull for example lag time is especially bad in places like vivec city abahs landing mournhold and a couple of the other larger citiesgathering places i have the fastest internet service that xfinity offers in the denver co area so thats not an issue i love the game but hate the issues i just mentionedgale mckaig • 8 months ago thanks for sharing i was wondering about the internet speed thing their servers are down every other day now horrible lag textures dont load etc i wish i could understand why a company with that much money cant perform well nik hartsfield • 9 months ago apparently this downtime happens about once a month and it takes several hours im annoyed af but more than that i cant help but wonder what could possibly take that long that also needs to be done that often michael burchett • 7 months agomore like every 3 days i know this is 2 already this week trevor burden • 9 months ago played wow for 10 years and although they have weekly maintenance they at least give a start and finish time wit eso its a game of chance jordan parrish • 9 months ago way too much lag i have high speed internet and it still laggs nicki duzy • 9 months ago its been two weeks and every time i start to play the server kicks me off within 5 minutes my internet connection of fine so how do i fix the problem john c espinosa • 9 months ago june 21 i keep getting kicked off to log in screen then it wont log in zenimax gave their words of wisdom which

endless loading screen mombasa69 • 11 months ago i wonder if these long maintenance times and constant bugs are down to the fact eso uses that ancient and archaic bugged up hero engine the real scientific socialist • 11 months ago it was working yesterday but i guess i just have to wait fallen heros • 11 months ago eso is fun but it has some terrible launches if not the worst in all my years of playing when morrowind comes out expect the following 1 unable to connect 2 continuous disconnects 3 unable to connect 4 continuous disconnects 5 unable to connect 6 continuous disconnects expect this to last 34 months before the game is playable i remember the first launch and cyrodil was an epic failure jake miester • 11 months ago it says na servers are timed out help hardcore gamer991 • 11 months agoexperiencing horrible lag on both na and euro servers today makes game unplayable its not me nor my internet provider all my other online games run fine its on the zenimax end so glad i didnt buy the subscription too many problems when i am trying to play word of advice do not buy subscription you will be disappointed by the amount of server problems daniela s nassetti • 11 months
