resin bound gravel what is resin bound paving resin bound paving fixes together small stones with hightech resin to form a firm attractive surface it creates many small gaps that allow water to drain through into the ground this technology combines the best of other surfaces the drainage and appearance of loose gravel the durability and convenience of block paving longterm performance of block pavers contact us to find out more or call 01273 358177why choose resin bound paving when rainwater falls on a paved surface it needs to drain away conventional solid surfaces are impermeable water flows across the surface or forms pools adding to flood risk gravel surfaces avoid this problem water flows freely through the small stones and into the ground but gravel surfaces can be messy and difficult for pushchairs or wheelchairs resin bound paving combines the benefits of both options excellent rainwater drainage and a smart durable accessible smooth surface environmentally friendly reduced flood risk firm surface attractive finish easy maintenance choice of colours please take a look at our range to find out what colours and textures are available fantastic service and quality control from clearstone clearstone surfaces are individually handcrafted at every stage of the design and installation process we do our utmost to understand your specific needs and our attention to detail is second to none take a look at our case study page to read about our customers experience of working with clearstone and visit our gallery to view our extensive portfolio of driveway installations quality control because we control the process from start to finish you can be sure of a perfect finish“clearstone staff were brilliant we love them they were the best contractors we had on site”elizabeth baines homeowner“i’m absolutely delighted with our new driveway it cost me slightly more than block paving my driveway and our house stands out from other houses on the street” david ayling homeowner resin bound paving  the premium option the modern technology involved in resin bound paving calls for careful selection of the best materials and skilful installation by experts this means superior resin bound surfaces can cost more than other options but the results make this investment worthwhile cheaper options may involve nonexpert installation with a risk of later problems nonspecialist installers may use substandard materials that degrade or discolour in sunlight over time some contractors may offer resinbonded surfaces – cheaper than true resin bound paving despite the name resinbonded surfaces are very different to resin bound – they lack the permeability that allows rainwater to drain freely into the ground and have a very rough texture bound permeable smooth surface compliant with su ds regulations resin bound surfacing or ‘trowelled’ paving is made from a blend of aggregates coated with a clear uvstable polyurethane resin to ensure that each aggregate particle is completely coated in resin the two elements are combined in a forceaction mix process to form a coldpour mixture the mixture is then poured and handtrowelled to form a smooth colourconstant accurate surface with no loose stones it is recommended that a resin bound surface should be laid to a depth of 15mm for a pool surround footpath or terrace and 18mm for a driveway and car park resin bound surfacing is waterpermeable when laid on a an open surface asphalt bonded nonpermeable and rough surface by contrast resin bonded surfacing or ‘scattercoat’ paving is nonpermeable and must be laid on a nonporous fine wearing course asphalt or concrete base with resin bonded paving soakaways and channel drains must be installed to prevent runoff which could lead to flooding resin bonded surfacing is made by sprinkling loose aggregate onto resin however it’s not as durable as resin bound paving the bonded aggregate particles may loosen over time due to car tyres turning on the surface and it is not as easy to clean depending on the aggregate size 13mm the depth is generally 3mm technical information for more technical information about the difference between a resin ‘bound’ and a resin ‘bonded’ surface please download our explanation pdf
