how the aurora borealis form it begins with a solar flare the aurora borealis northern lights form when charged particles emitted from the sun during a solar flare penetrate the earths magnetic shield and collide with atoms and molecules in our atmosphere these collisions result in countless little bursts of light called photons which make up the aurora collisions with oxygen produce red and green auroras while nitrogen produces the pink and purple colors this reaction encircles the polar regions of the earth and occurs at an altitude of 40400 miles 65650 km in a zone called the auroral oval when  where the aurora borealis most commonly occur between 60°75° latitude but during great geomagnetic storms the auroral oval expands equatorially and can reach 30° latitude or further in the northern hemisphere they are called the aurora borealis northern lights and in the southern hemisphere aurora australis southern lights an auroral display might be observed any night from dusk until dawn as long as it is dark which excludes alaskan summer nights mayjuly the best time to view them is between midnight and 2 am there is an 11year solar cycle on average that controls the tempo of the aurora the most recent peak in the cycle occurred in 2014 the next peak is predicted for around 2025but do not despair there will be plenty of auroras between now  zen share follow us site map ordering pricing  information online orders return  refund policy privacy and cookie policy contact us19072504711email us todd salat shots 645 g st suite 100 798 anchorage ak 99501gallery outlets copyright © 2018 todd salat  aurora hunter ® is a registered trademark
