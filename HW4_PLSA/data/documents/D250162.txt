in the buylocal movement comment by emily bamforth clevelandcomebamforthclevelandcom cleveland ohio  the idea seems fairly simple  spend money locally support the local economy but it might not be quite that easy the buy local movement is one that is driving consumer choices seventy percent of adults say they are more likely to visit a restaurant that offers locally produced food items according to the national restaurant association in addition eightythree percent of young adults say they are more trusting of a business if it is socially and economically responsible according to cone communications the buy local movement is complicated there are many different ethical environmental and economic considerations to make when making the decision to place a focus on purchasing from local businesses keep it in the pool there are studies that show that local businesses circulate more money back into the local economy one study focused on salt lake city utah found that local retailers return a total of 52 percent of their revenue to the local economy whereas national chains only return 14 percent but thinking only about the local economy could be dangerous economic impact studies ignore the opportunity cost of the dollar said jayson lusk a professor and willard sparks endowed chair of agribusiness in the department of agricultural economics at the university of oklahoma theres a question of whether or not we want to subsidize this kind of buying he said normally the way an economist would try to answer these questions is asking where is the failure isolating economies may lead to consumers being given less choices as well as trade being upset for example if northeast ohio decided to only support local goods a bunch of produce would become unavailable like pineapple or guava the united states would lose a lot of products that it needs or that are of higher quality if customers only consumed americanmade products the rising tide you can see where your money is going buying locally can help local farmers and business owners get more money in their pocket as well as enabling consumers to communicate with the creators of their products a farmer will be a marketer a distributor and a processor said erika meschkat a program coordinator at the ohio state extension for cuyahoga county theyre going to be able to expand their acreage and scaling up will create a ripple in the economy less distance and middlemen between producer and consumer also allows for more clarity for the purchaser on where their goods are coming from and how theyre made but buying locally may not fiscally be the best idea the local foods movement is mainly accessible to the upper middleclass but some individuals may be priced out of being able to buy foods grown organically or locally lusk along with franklin norwood an associate professor in the agricultural economics at the university of oklahoma wrote an article for the library of economics and liberty about the fallacies of the locavore lifestyle a major point they raise is the issue of comparative advantage or buying products that are going to be more advantageous economically to the consumer the buying local concept assumes that if you import something that that money is lost and never comes back norwood said raises all ships buying locally could be a job creator buying from local businesses puts money in owners hands which they could use to expand this would allow for more jobs to be created in the local economy anything about buying local kind of makes sense said randy carpenter the senior director of corporate communications and public relations for the council of smaller enterprises cose its all part of that local ecosystem but just because its local doesnt mean its more ethical the tie between social responsibility and local buying is one that needs to be examined closely norwood said is it more ethical because its local maybe maybe not norwood said its so hard to figure out what components are ethical or not ethical this could include farming practices how a product is created or how the business treats its workers bottom line do what works best for you the buy local movement is another consumer choice that people can make when it comes to ticking items off their tobuy list with a number of considerations to make the best plan of action is to weigh the options its all very personal meschkat said i do think theres a place for nonlocal food in peoples diets i wouldnt say everybody should eat strictly local food but there is a definite benefit to the popularization of the local food movement education it makes people more interested in their food choices norwood said it made me more deliberate about my food choices thats an aspect of local foods that i didnt recognize when it comes to supporting the local economy however norwood said the movement might be faulty theres certainly no guarantee he said it doesnt necessarily increase the wealth of a region  employment and wealth are two different things view comments
