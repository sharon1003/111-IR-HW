home  how to disable or delay the lock screen in windows 8how to disable or delay the lock screen in windows 8posted on november 15 2013 by vonnie — 12 comments there’s a large part of my heart that feels like microsoft neglected nontouch screen users with windows 8 yes i get it touch is purported to become increasing ubiquitous however i like my nontouch laptop just fine for people like us it’s disconcerting to have to jump through hoops to make our computers work the way we want if you’re in a bad mood i’m convinced that your bilious disposition is a function of everything microsoft took away in windows 8 but it doesn’t have to be all bad with a few nimble clicks we can easily disable the lock screen or if i can’t induce you to completely forsake the lock screen i’ll show you how to increase how long it takes before the screen locks on your computer when it’s idle let’s talk about disabling the lock screen we’ll set it up so when windows wakes up it zips right to the password input screen and completely avoids that annoying tablet biased screen…disabling the lock screen we can make windows comply with our wishes by kicking open the local group policy editor and enabling the do not display lock screen attribute press the windows key  r to bust open the run dialog box then type thisgpeditmsc welcome to the local group policy editor this program is what microsoft calls a mmc snapin and it gives you a single interface to a myriad of configuration goodies i encourage you to explore all the stuff you can change here after you read this post to disable the lock screen click through the following folders in the left pane computer configuration administrative templates control panel personalization and then double click do not display lock screen in the properties screen change the radio button from not configured to enabled click ok and you’re done give it a quick test press the windows key  l and you should see the password input box instead of that inane lock screen if you don’t have the group policy editor i don’t think windows 8 core has it you can accomplish the same magic with the registry editor from the start screen type it out and press enterregedit when it launches the user account control box pops into your face click yes now click file and choose export so you can save a copy of the registry it’s really important to do this every time you make a registry change because if you don’t know what you’re doing you can really break things save the export to a jump drive and follow me in the left pane navigate to computerhkeylocalmachinesoftwarepoliciesmicrosoftwindows now right click that windows key choose new and pick key from menu name it personalization next right click an empty area of the right pane and choose new and choose dword 32bit valuename it no lock screenand doubleclick it and change the value from 0 to 1 click ok and that will do it for you it should look like the graphic below delaying the lock screen to increase the time it takes the lock screen to appears on your idle computer just right click the desktop choose personalize and pick screen saver in the screen saver settings box change the wait time to a higher value check on resume display logon screen and choose ok that’s itabout vonnie connect with vonnie on twitter‹ how to disable the trackpad on your windows 7 laptop how to

the joys of windows 81fox helms • 3 years ago here is a much easier and more effective way to do it if youre using a laptopclick on the battery icon in the task tray at the bottom right of your screen select more power options this should bring you to a control panel window make sure hp recommended is selected and click on the link to the right that says change plan settings where it says put the computer to sleep change both drop downs to never then click save changes and youre done now you can leave your laptop idle for as long as you want and you will still return to an unlocked laptopbob peck • 3 years ago thanks vonnie i had found several instructions on this but my system wont recognize the gpeditmsc command and evidently doesnt have a local group policy editor and my registry didnt have a personalization key your instructions to create a new key did it seems it would have been simple for microsoft to have put an option for this somewhere in the control panel i could have saved millions of us an hour each searching the internet for a solutionpscottcummins • 4 years ago thanks so much for this you really saved my hide vonnie i wish you were president of microsoft relating their arcane ways of doing things in a common sense howpeopleactuallythinkandtalk manner seems to have escaped the bazillion people working there bob peck • 3 years ago agreed  vonnie for presidentdragonnightfire • 4 years ago it works with windows 81 but you have to reboot in order for any registry changes to take affect
