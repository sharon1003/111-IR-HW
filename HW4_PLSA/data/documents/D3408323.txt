asked questions about html5 video i’ve been fasting once per month for 5 days since my first water fast experiment in june 2015 if you are new to fasting you can get all the why and how basic details in that post the results from my 5 day fast cycles have been so positive that i couldn’t help but wonder if more is better when it comes to fasting this led me to ask“will i benefit from a 10 day fast programmed into my life once per quarter or twice per year”to get an answer to that i broke that down into the following questions i was going to try to answer with this first 10 day fast can i remain productive during a 10 day fast 10 days is a big chunk of time to strike off from work and life – far too big for my taste let’s be sure i’m not throwing away the equivalent of 40 productive days a year with this habitwould my mental performance suffer perhaps leading subtly to worse decisions or perhaps just slower thinking would my energy levels remain the same or decrease would there be a change in how many hours i could comfortably work per day how about concentration focus and drive is “10 day fasting” every quarter sustainable specifically where i’m doing monthly cycles of 5 day fasts in between would i double the weight loss of a 5 day fast and thus make it difficult to recover the weight within the following month the question here does weight loss follow a linear path based on number of days fasted would a 10 day water fast be as easy psychologically and physiologically as the 5 day water fasts or would i hate it  nothing we hate is going to get done repeatedlyis there any downside impact on “adrenal health” or cortisol regulation from fasting this is a question i’ve been attempting to answer since i started long duration fastingto try to answer these questions i tracked cognitive performance hormones metabolism and weight throughout the fast i also committed to following a normal rhythm of life and work during the fast this time i would run life as usual and let the chips fall where they may – i would see if the fast got in the way  note please do not take this as advice to do this at home yourself – i’m not a doctor and would be extremely upset if you hurt yourself – please be cautious with fasting the outcome we’ll get to in the results in a second but but first “the why”…why do a 10 day fast we’ve covered the benefits and whys of fasting well in previous episodes however as a quick reminder here’s the list anticancer leveraging the metabolic theory of cancer and dr thomas seyfried’s work fasting may be an effective tactic to reduce our future risk of cancer immune system effectiveness cyclic fasting has been shown to regenerate immune system cells which deteriorate ‘naturally’ as we age or via environmental or other insults thus it may reduce or stave off some of this natural deterioration and keep us healthier a stronger body lean body mass gains including bone density increase and muscle mass increase have also been tracked in studies and myself body fat removal fasting or cycles of fasting can be a useful tactic for removing unwanted excess body fat the 10 day water fast results metabolism on 10 day fast looks similar to 5 day fast in 5 day fasts i consistently see glucose drop to between 50 and 60 mgd l and ketones rise to between 5 and 7 mmoll in the additional 5 days it seems you shouldn’t expect any big change my numbers came back largely the same my ‘switch time’ from glucose to ketone metabolism continues to edge forward to happen slightly earlier with each fast i do this time just past the 48 hour mark the switch took place – my blood ketones jumped up and glucose dropped down to their fasting equilibrium levels my metabolism had switched to ketone burning a few interesting points there was a slight glucose upwards blip on days 6 and 7 where it rose back up to between 60 and 70 mgd l this was most likely caused by the sleep disruption i experienced from day 5  see sleep details  low quality sleep tends to impair glucose regulation – thus higher but still low glucose on day 7 and 9 i got several “hi” errors for my ketone readings meaning that my ketones were over 8 mmoll the upper limit of the ketone meter’s range for the first 3 days post fast days 10 to 13 my ketones were still spiking high in the evenings and quite erratic – this was most likely an anomaly this time around due to my postfast rookie mistake despite the glucose uptick on day 5 i stayed well within the therapeutic range to provide anticancer benefits outlined by dr thomas seyfried see explanation via my interview with him in episode 16  so long as you remain under a glucose ketone index of 1 you are assumed to be within the therapeutic range as per chart below where i’m shown to have had a complete 8 days of therapeutic anticancer action weight loss how much  how long to gain it back over the 10 days i lost a total of 5kg ll lbs of weight the weight loss was at a consistent daily rate as usual except for days 8 and 9 where it stalled at a weight loss plateau before a further drop on the morning of the last day i regained all the lost weight by the 18th day after the end of the fast – and this was despite some digestion restartup issues for the first 3 days post fast  see the postfast rookie mistake for the details  so the weight was really recovered via 15 days of normal eating testosterone on a fast big drop  libido changes it makes sense that you shouldn’t expect to be on top of your ‘libido’ game while fasting when food is scarce we should have evolutionarily had more important things on our mind – like finding food to survive this was certainly part of my experience the longer the fast the less interest i had in women or sex by day 5 my testosterone levels dutch test – see in labs had dropped below the 20 to 40 year old male reference range a couple of studies i found corroborated this with testosterone dropping significantly during fasts and then rebounding strongly with refeeding 1 2 the takeaway not a good idea to fast on honeymoons or dates the day after ending the fast – great idea is it ok to fast with adrenal fatigue in previous fasting episodes i’ve noted that i’m working on “low free cortisol” levels that i’ve been tracking for a couple of years a situation that i expect based on symptoms i now understand dates back to as much as 10 years ago one of my concerns with repeated fasting considered a stressor was that it may not necessarily help with this situation – when you look at it through the lens of “adrenal fatigue” specifically i was referring to the idea that low free cortisol  “adrenal fatigue” thus adding more stress could exacerbate the issue reasoning that the adrenal glands are already overstretched in a normal everyday scenario without that added stressor in this fast i learned that there’s less reason for concern than i’d initially considered you need a bit of background to understand why historically people from the functional medicine realm have referred to “adrenal fatigue” as a state of fatigue of the adrenal glands whereby you typically have low energy in the afternoons this can happen to me at times it is documented and diagnosed via 4point free cortisol salivary tests like the one from biohealth that i’ve done previously see the results from previous adrenal labs in this episode  however that name doesn’t have a very accurate definition or explanation the term is used quite vaguely for the most part we can’t scan an adrenal gland and see it in a withered state for example we don’t have a specific test that can show the state of ‘adrenal gland fatigue’ that ties it back to the adrenal gland itself so a new term that is surfacing for the situation of low free cortisol is “cortisol dysregulation” as a result it provides at least a ‘less wrong’ definition cortisol isn’t normal it’s lower than it should be – and thus is driving some fatigue symptoms it’s dysregulated another term you may have heard is hpa axis dysregulation the dutch test i used to track my hormones is useful where it comes to investigating and better understanding cortisol metabolism as it looks at both free and metabolized cortisol metabolized cortisol is a proxy for total cortisol output the traditional salivary tests used look only at free cortisol levels thus dutch enables you to assess whether your total levels of cortisol are low the adrenal output is lower or if it’s just free cortisol that is low and total cortisol is normal as you can see below my total cortisol metabolized cortisol is right in the middle of the normal reference range metabolized cortisol levels baseline and fastedso in my case it turns out that i have above average metabolized cortisol levels – so in fact total cortisol output is well within the normal range it’s just my free cortisol levels that continue to come back below the reference range now crosschecked with two labs dutch test  biohealth 201  i don’t have reduced adrenal output i have normal adrenal output – which would fit the old definition “adrenal fatigue” that’s good news nonetheless the low free cortisol has to be troubleshot the most likely explanation behind this is that i’ve been subjected to a long term stressor and my body has compensated to lower free cortisol levels that maps to other information – that underlying stress is most likely high ongoing inflammation levels that i have documented over several years now24 hour free cortisol levels baseline and fastedthe takeaway rather than just relying on propping up my adrenals with adaptogens it’s pretty clear that the end game is to continue to explore and resolve all causes of stress inflammation is my obvious first target although it’s another reminder to keep up my lifestyle stress management practices adaptogens meditation circadian rhythm and sleep note for those who like to dig into the data – here’s an explanation of the cortisol results from the dutch test did mental performance keep up during the fast although i’ve always “felt productive” when fasting i wasn’t as sure that my mental performance was the same this time round i planned to try to capture this information properly unfortunately the results weren’t very clear i used quantified mind the tool we covered in episode 33 to track my cognitive performance in terms of working memory and attention control the main issue i was advised to eliminate by yoni donner founder of quantified mind was the practice effect as we perform any mental test repeatedly we get better – to understand if a fast was impacting me cognitively i needed to try to eliminate that to do this i used the same test repeatedly during the few months before the fast due to travel this wasn’t as consistent as i would have liked the idea is that eventually you peak out and any practice based improvements will have dried up or be minimal as you can see in the data above it looks like there were some pretty strong practice effects taking place throughout and after the fast the fasting period is shaded out in blue as a result i’ll be continuing to use the same test panel in future fasts and in between to see if i can separate these out with continued repetition i should be able to isolate any fasting effects the 10day fast experience with repeated cycles of fasting i have become a lot more comfortable with “how it feels” – both body and mind do feel different on the water fast – the first experience i was cautious due to this – not knowing if i had new limitations that i shouldn’t cross now that i have got used to fasting i basically run life as usual i don’t restrict my activity level or my schedule or need to plan for it in this fast of course i committed to making this a goal in itself to understand if fasting limits me as a result during the 10 day fast i was out meeting friends business contacts – and even went on a date to an art exhibition nonetheless there are things to note…physical weakness i experienced less of the feeling of physical weakness than in previous fasts – a heaviness or lack of refined motor control of the arms and legs i tested this a bit further on day 2 with one set of 55 push ups my current 1 set max this didn’t feel much different to doing it in a nonfasted state during this fast as i was going about my days i had times when i actually felt ‘physically strong’ and was naturally walking around at a rapid pace this was more so on the last 5 days of the fast so that difference may simply be related to the fast being longer in many ways the last 10 days were more physically comfortable than the first 5 days sleep – my next challenge on most of my fasts the biggest downside is sleep disruption after a few days on the fast i tend to start to have interrupted sleep this fast was no exception from day 5 i began to get night wakings as early as a couple of hours after going to sleep after some of these i wouldn’t be able to get back to sleep for hours the exception was the last night – on day 10 – i had perfect sleep longer duration and deeper than usual judging by the drowsy feeling combined with how refreshed i felt in the morning sleep disruption and night wakings are shown to impair glucose metabolism so it’s the likely cause of the slight rise in glucose i experienced on day 5 and 6 also for future fasts i’ll be making sleep a priority to investigate track and optimize the mind retreat the mental experience of fasting for 10 days allowed me to appreciate more clearly aspects that i’d noticed in shorter fasts fasting promotes a less rushed more practical and more bigger picture thinking state of mind for me the contrast of this with the typical more frenetic ‘getting things done’ focus of life is very attractive in my mind it presents a great counter balance to keep your decisions in check once a month it enables you to look at life work from this other perspective once per month if you’re doing the cyclic fasting and that strikes me as a good thing for decision making this was far more noticeable on the 10 day fast some of this may be related to the drop in testosterone and libido i tracked the postfast rookie mistake if you’re thinking of undertaking a 10 day water fast yourself this is possibly the most important section – pay attention – i made the mistake and paid for it for 3 days after the fast i suffered from gut and toilet problems severe pain the first night to discomfort and the inability to keep anything actually inside me for the 3 following days it was a simple mistake i assumed that what works postfast for 5 days should be okay for 10 days despite having spoken with people having done 10 or more day fasts that advised caution the biggest difference between the 5 and 10 day fast is how you start to refeed i prepare and eat a couple of bowls of bone broth after my 5 day fasts without issue i’ve found it to be a great high micronutrient way to ease back into eating however with the 10 day fast this turned out to be a disaster my body simply was not able to deal with high levels of fat found in bone broth my appetite didn’t return as a result either so i was having to push myself to squeeze in small meals after 3 days of failing to get my digestion back to normality with a variety of food combinations i thought would work vegetable soup scrambled eggs etc i had to rethink my strategy i resorted to drinking exclusively blended green vegetable smoothies the turnaround was amazing all my digestion issues disappeared literally with the first couple of glasses and my digestion issues were completely resolved within the next 24 hours i kept that program up for a few more days nonetheless to make sure i was past the issues so my strong recommendation to anyone trying this – and myself for future long duration fasts – will be to start with exclusively vegetable smoothies for the first 24 hours as a minimum better 48 hours that should lay the digestive foundation to be able to move back to your usual eating patterns symptoms – the back rash i’ve experienced some slight rashes during fasts before with this longer fast it was a lot more extreme by day 10 my whole back was covered with a rash of spots – just the back it was quite stunning – it made me think back to the time i caught chicken pox this rash disappeared just as quick within a couple of few days of refeeding it was completely gone again the takeaways so coming back to the questions we want to answer can i remain productive during a 10 day fast would my mental performance suffer perhaps leading subtly to worse decisions or perhaps just slower thinking answer it’s not clear as yet it doesn’t look like there was any drastic mental performance impact on working memory or attention control future testing will need to be done with future fasts to further validate would my energy levels remain the same or decrease would there be a change in how many hours i could comfortably work per day answer there was no noticeable big change in energy levels or hours worked during the fast if anything i felt a little more wired and thus had to reduce my intake of caffeine how about concentration focus and drive answer testosterone is often associated with these attributes in men low testosterone tends to reduce these attributes however while my testosterone dropped during the fast that’s not something i experienced in a future 10 day fast i’ll track testosterone on the last day day 10 to see if the hormonal impact is greater than the mid fast impact day 5 is “10 day fasting” every quarter sustainable specifically where i’m doing monthly cycles of 5 day fasts in between would i double the weight loss of a 5 day fast and thus make it difficult to recover the weight within the following month answer weight loss wasn’t exactly linear – there was a leveling off at one point so weight loss per day was slightly less than with that i’ve experienced with the 5 day fast the weight was easily regained within 15 days – so there doesn’t look to be an issue with not being able to maintain my equilibrium weight when i introduce 10 day fasts every quarter in between the monthly cyclic 5 day fasts would a 10 day water fast be as easy psychologically and physiologically as the 5 day water fasts or would i hate it answer if anything the 10 day fast was easier and got easier as i got into it this could be due to my growing experience with fasting – “practice effects” or that fasts do get easier the longer you’re on them i think it’s probably a bit of both of these is there any downside impact on “adrenal health” or cortisol regulation from fasting this is a question i’ve been attempting to answer since i started long duration fasting answer my total cortisol and 24hr free cortisol were slightly lower on day 5 of the fast compared with baseline despite having done many fasts my 24hr free cortisol levels have not dropped from the original values i tracked a year previously – they’re stable my total cortisol is also well within normal output ranges so my inclination is to say no i’d like to check in a future 10 day fast the cortisol metabolism on day 10 to see if there is a ‘declining slide’ in cortisol output over longer duration fasts episode question are you convinced about the rewards of water fasting to try it yourself yet if not what else would you need to know to get you there let me know in the comments tracking biomarkers blood ketones betahydroxybutyrate  βhydroxybutyrate blood ketones are the gold standard for measuring your state of ketosis during the fast ketones are expected to peak in the range of between 6 and 8 mmoll dominic d’agostino mentions that metabolic acidosis with values over 5 mmoll place an additional burden of processing on your body so in non fasting states keeping values between 1 and 5 mmoll may be optimum blood glucose mgdl a measure of the level of glucose in the blood at one point in time values of between 50mgd l and 60mgd l are standard for fasts nonfasting values should be below 80mgd l ideally and at least 92mgd l glucoseketone index gki the ratio between the concentration of glucose in the blood to ketone bodies in the blood the calculation is glucose mmol ketone mmol dr seyfried created the index as a better way to assess metabolic status therapeutic efficacy is considered best with index values approaching 10 or below patients with chronic disease like cancer have consistent index values of 50 or more weight lbs standard scales measurement of weight in morning without clothes to avoid biases lab tests devices and apps blood ketone glucose monitors the precision xtra in the u s or freestyle optium neo in the uk are the current recommended monitors you’ll need lancets ketone strips and glucose strips also dutch dried urine test for comprehensive hormones this advanced hormone test panel from precision analytical is currently the most comprehensive and convenient test looking at cortisol metabolism and sex hormones i used it to track baseline and fasting hormones you can download my complete lab test results here baseline test results  day 5 of fast test results quantified mind the free online tool used to track cognitive performance during the fast – you can learn more about using the tool in this episode with its creator yoni donner i used two short tests yoni recommended to use for a mental performance checkin requiring a minimum of time 5 minutes color word inhibition a test that measures attention control via the stroop effect selfpaced 2back a version of the nback game used to assess working memory muse calm mentioned as one of the better return on effort items discovered through the quantified body’s exploration so far interview with the founder ariel garten in previous episode here tools  tactics fasting protocols water fast “water fasts” are the standard fast protocol used in most of the research studies including those looking at cancer inhibition or therapy for cancer patients people are more or less extreme with the definition of what a water fast consists of i personally am looking for the ‘biological effects’ or results i’m not concerned with sticking to purely water unless that’s what is required to gain those results so my version in this fast includes some supplement support which should not interfere with the beneficial fasting mechanisms – see below in supplements for details5 day water fast a minimum of 3 days is required to flip most people’s metabolic switch between glucose and ketone metabolism and attain the benefits of the fast for this reason a good place to start with water fasting is 5 days which incorporates 2 days of therapy time ie after the 3 day lead time to switch the metabolism you can see this effect taking place in my first 5day water fast selfexperiment the 5 day fast is also manageable on a cyclic monthly basis 25 days of normal life and 5 days of fasting per month10 day water fast to provide a deeper dose of therapy ie 7 days people are extending their fasting times to 10 days or beyond as per my interview with dr thomas seyfried this may be more effective with respect to the anticancer effects depending on your risk profile this may be something you consider doing from time to time fast mimicking diet fmd a diet designed by researcher valter longo to maximize activation of the beneficial fasting mechanisms while still allowing you to eat to an extent the details of this type of fast were covered in my fmd selfexperiment in episode 31 supplements my goal with this fast was to support my body without interfering with the beneficial fasting mechanisms and to stay productive throughout work wise and socially so this is actually what i did mineral supports this was the main supplementation i took covering a broad spectrum of minerals real salt i sprinkled real salt into the filtered water i was drinking throughout the fast quinton hypertonic a seawater electrolytes solution with a broad spectrum of minerals pure encapsulations minerals 650 capsules containing a broad spectrum of minerals both of the above recommended to me by chris shade from this episodeancient minerals magnesium spray typically i apply this to my skin daily after showers for absorption via that route however i’ve also started to spray it into my drinking water along with the real salt and continued this during the fast note spraying the oil in drinking water was a tip from andrew scarborough in an upcoming interview – episode 44 drinks besides water i also consumed some other drinks during the fast primarily for productivity purposes my usual routine is to have a coffee in the morning with the obvious caffeine jolt – so i kept to that usual routine just keeping it to simple no calorie versions black coffee for the first 5 days i took a black coffee in the morning however i typically found that i naturally didn’t finish it as the first continued i increasingly felt the caffeine from this single coffee was too much of a stimulant the effect seemed to be magnified so half way through i switched to…teas mostly green tea also some rooibos and camomile tea i found the green tea didn’t overstimulate as much although i was still maxed out on 1 or 2 cups more than that and i got the jitters personal note background on using minerals in fast there was another more personal reason i included a good amount of mineral supplementation during the fast since the episode with chris shade i’ve been following his mercury and heavy metals removal protocol part of that protocol requires that you take a break from time to time to halt the process and remineralize the body since a side effect of the protocol is removing needed minerals along with the heavy metals i wasn’t going to be following the shade protocol during the 10 day water fast i stop all other experiments and protocols while fasting so it made sense for efficiency to use that time for remineralization other people books  resources people dr thomas seyfried see episode 16 for a discussion of his theories and work dominic d’agostino dominic has led some of the research into the benefits of ketone bodies and metabolic therapies he is now turning much of his research effort towards cancer similarly to thomas seyfried
