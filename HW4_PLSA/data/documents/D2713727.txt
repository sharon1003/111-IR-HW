ever seen on grosse pointe little league diamonds as a 12yearold he famously found the upper deck at old tiger stadium now the legend of prince fielder appears to be ending early too according to multiple reports fielder’s career is over at the age of 32 following a second surgery on his neck the texas rangers and fielder will hold a news conference wednesday making it official fielder will not retire per se because doing so would forfeit the money he’s still owed on the mammoth nineyear 214million contract he signed with the tigers prior to the 2012 season instead fielder will reveal doctors won’t give him the clearance to play again a second neck surgery has further limited his flexibility and range of motion fielder still is owed about 104 million through the 2020 season with the tigers responsible for about 24 million of that as part of the terms of the fielderian kinsler trade on nov 20 2013 texas will recoup about half of its responsibility through insurance the tigers had insurance when fielder played in detroit but according to a source in the front office that policy gives the tigers no relief on their bill which was 6 million due to the rangers each year from 201620 fielder who grew up in metro detroit when his father cecil was a star player for the tigers — they were even in a popular mc donald’s commercial together — will finish with 319 majorleague home runs coincidentally that’s the same number cecil retired with after 13 seasons including seven with the tigers only barry and bobby bonds 1094 and ken griffey jr and sr 782 had more combined home runs among fatherson duos in the major leagues the tigers signed fielder in a wildly popular move jan 24 2012 just days after they learned slugger victor martinez would be lost for the entire 2012 season after suffering a knee injury during a workout at home in florida after the martinez injury thengeneral manager dave dombrowski told the media fielder wasn’t a fit that was until ilitch picked up the phone and said essentially “sign prince”it was the latest in a line of bold moves by mike ilitch though this one was among the most special for the billionaire owner who always had a special bond with cecil fielder and always wanted prince fielder“it’s always been on my mind over the years” ilitch said during the introductory press conference “i go by my instincts and my instincts told me this is going to be fine i know what prince can do”ilitch even thought the tigers would land fielder in the 2002 draft but the milwaukee brewers took him with the seventh overall pick the tigers selecting one pick later settled for a shortstop named scott moore fielder was impactful in the lineup for the tigers with 30 home runs and 108 rbis the first season in detroit then 25 homers and 106 rbis his second as he and miguel cabrera combined for one of the most potent 34 combinations in baseball fielder though floundered in the playoffs in detroit with two key baserunning blunders standing out he was thrown out at home in game 2 of the 2012 world series though that was more on third base coach gene lamont then in game 6 of the 2013 american league championship series in boston he was caught in a pivotal rundown between third base and home and tagged out as he memorably bellyflopped back toward — but well short of — third base he batted 196 with one home run in five postseason series with detroit and fell out of favor among fans following the 2013 alcs loss after which fielder quickly dismissed the loss in a nonchalant way — “i’ve got kids” — while fans still were crushed the tigers dealt him to the rangers in the november 2013 blockbuster saddening his good buddy cabrera who immediately started sending out a string of photos of himself and fielder on social media personally the trade seemed a good one for fielder who was in the middle of divorce proceedings during his final season in detroit but reconciled with his wife chanel after moving to texas professionally things weren’t as good fielder never missed a game in detroit — he played 547 consecutive games from 201014 but wearing a new number 84 — which some saw as a dig at the tigers who haven’t won a world series since 1984 — fielder then missed most of his first season with the rangers to have neck surgery he rebounded in 2015 with 23 home runs and 98 rbis to earn al comeback player of the year honors this year though was a disaster as he never got going with the bat and had just a 626 ops his career mark is 887 through 89 games before deciding to shut it down again and undergo a second neck surgery it turns out that was one neck surgery too many kinsler 34 meanwhile has been a wildly welcome piece for the tigers he made an allstar team his first season with detroit while having one of his best seasons yet in the major leagues this year with 21 home runs 62 rbis and a teamleading 48 war kinsler has one guaranteed year left on his contract for 11 million the tigers have a 12 million option
