how to teach long division in this article i explain how to teach long division in several steps instead of showing the whole algorithm to the students at once we truly take it step by step before a child is ready to learn long division heshe has to knowmultiplication tables at least fairly wellbasic division concept based on multiplication tables for example 28 ÷ 7 or 56 ÷ 8basic division with remainders for example 54 ÷ 7 or 23 ÷ 5one reason why long division is difficult long division is an algorithm that repeats the basic steps of 1 divide 2 multiply 3 subtract 4 drop down the next digit of these steps 2 and 3 can become difficult and confusing to students because they dont seemingly have to do with division —they have to do with finding the remainder in fact to point that out i like to combine them into a single multiply  subtract step to avoid the confusion i advocate teaching long division in such a fashion that children are not exposed to all of those steps at first instead you can teach it in several steps step 1 division is even in all the digits here students practice just the dividing part step 2 a remainder in the ones now students practice the  multiply  subtract  part and connect that with finding the remainder step 3 a remainder in the tens students now use the whole algorithm including dropping down the next digit using 2digit dividends step 4 a remainder in any of the place values students practice the whole algorithm using longer dividends step 1 division is even in all the digits we divide numbers where each of the hundreds tens and ones digits are evenly divisible by the divisor the goal in this first easy step is to get students used to two things to get used to the long division corner so that the quotient is written on top to get used to asking how many times does the divisor go into the various digits of the dividend example problems for this step follow students should check each division by multiplicationa48 4b36 6 0c48 0 4 0in this step students also learn to look at the first two digits of the dividend if the divisor does not go into the first digith t o042 4 8h t o0 6 242 4 84 does not go into 2 you can put zero in the quotient in the hundreds place or omit it but 4 does go into 24 six times put 6 in the quotient explanation the 2 of 248 is of course 200 in reality if you divided 200 by 4 the result would be less than 100 so that is why the quotient wont have any whole hundreds but then you combine the 2 hundreds with the 4 tens that makes 24 tens and you can divide 24 tens by 4 the result 6 tens goes as part of the quotient check the final answer 4 × 62  248 more example problems follow divide check your answer by multiplying the quotient and the divisora31 2 3b42 8 4c63 6 0d82 4 8step 2 a remainder in the ones now there is a remainder in the ones units thousands hundreds and tens digits still divide evenly by the divisor first students can solve the remainder mentally and simply write the remainder right after the quotienth t o0 4 1 r141 6 54 does not go into 1 hundred so combine the 1 hundred with the 6 tens 1604 goes into 16 four times4 goes into 5 once leaving a remainder of 1th h t o0 4 0 0 r783 2 0 78 does not go into 3 of the thousands so combine the 3 thousands with the 2 hundreds 32008 goes into 32 four times 3200 ÷ 8  400 8 goes into 0 zero times tens 8 goes into 7 zero times and leaves a remainder of 7 next students learn to find the remainder using the process of multiply  subtract this is a very important step the multiply  subtract part is often very confusing to students so here we practice it in the easiest possible place in the very end of the division in the ones colum instead of in the tens or hundreds column of course this assumes that students have already learned to find the remainder in easy division problems that are based on the multiplication tables such as 45 ÷ 7 or 18 ÷ 5 in the problems before you just wrote down the remainder of the ones usually we write down the subtraction that actually finds the remainder look carefullyh t o0 6 142 4 7− 43when dividing the ones 4 goes into 7 one time multiply 1 × 4  4 write that four under the 7 and subract this finds us the remainder of 3 check 4 × 61  3  247th h t o0 4 0 241 6 0 9− 81when dividing the ones 4 goes into 9 two times multiply 2 × 4  8 write that eight under the 9 and subract this finds us the remainder of 1 check 4 × 402  1  1609here are some example problems now the students check the answer by multiplying the divisor times the quotient and then adding the remaindera31 2 8b39 5c64 2 6 7d42 8 4 5step 3 a remainder in the tens in this step students practice for the first time all the basic steps of long division algorithm divide multiply  subtract drop down the next digit we use twodigit numbers to keep it simple multiply  subtract has to do with finding the remainder and after finding a remainder we combine that with the next unit we are getting ready to divide dropping down the digit an example1 divide 2 multiply  subtract 3 drop down the next digitt o225 8two goes into 5 two times or 5 tens ÷ 2  2 whole tens  but there is a remaindert o225 8 41to find it multiply 2 × 2  4 write that 4 under the five and subtract to find the remainder of 1 tent o2 925 8 4 ↓1 8next drop down the 8 of the ones next to the leftover 1 ten you combine the remainder ten with 8 ones and get 181 divide 2 multiply  subtract 3 drop down the next digitt o2 925 8 41 8divide 2 into 18 place 9 into the quotientt o2 925 8 41 81 80multiply 9 × 2  18 write that 18 under the 18 and subtractt o2 925 8 41 81 80the division is over since there are no more digits in the dividend the quotient is 29 step 4 a remainder in any of the place values after the previous step has been mastered students then practice long division with three and fourdigit numbers where they will have to go through the basic steps several times1 divide 2 multiply  subtract 3 drop down the next digith

presents quite a complex thing for students to learn so in this case i dont see a problem with students first learning the algorithmic steps the how and later delving into the why trying to do both simultaneously may prove to be too much to some however once the student has a basic mastery of how to do long division it is time to also study what it is based on to learn more about that please see
