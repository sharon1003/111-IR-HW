of that matters because this product is a true miracle i love putting the product on at night and then waking up noticing all of the corrections it made to make skin while i slept consistent use will help keep away cystic acne as well worth every pennybrittanycorin14february 24 2018i s clinical proheal serum advance my dark spots are beginning to fade in the first few weeks of using it will continue to usefebruary 15 2018feels great but smells funny i love the way the product feels but it smells kind of like burnt wood february 07 2018clarify and sculpt this is my favorite is clinical serum its not as aggressive as the active serum but it still retexturizes and sculpts and has more of a healing factor that reduces rosacea i highly recommend itfebruary 07 2018not worth it at first i thought this product was working then i started to have dermatitis and my face became super red and more inflamed feel as though it cause cystic acne expensive product and not good results unfortunately november 29 2017just ok i have been using this product for a month and while it hasn’t caused any skin issues or irritation it hasn’t done anything special either so for that i rate this product 3 stars  november 03 2017i s clinical proheal serum advancei decided to try this serum to try to diminish redness flakiness and help with perioral dermatitis it did help with redness and flakiness which was great but unfortunately it made my perioral dermatitis flare up pretty badly after consistent use i think it may be great for others if you have other types of eczemadermatitis
