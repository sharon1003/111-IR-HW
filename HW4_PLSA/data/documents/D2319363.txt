span 1215 years a panther is actually a jaguar or a leopard black panther world map it turns out many of us have even the most basic of panther facts wrong we tend to assume that a panther is an entirely separate species of big cat however when we discuss panther facts we usually actually mean either jaguar or leopard facts depending on the geographic location this is because a panther is defined as a melanistic color variant of other species in the panthera genus which includes tigers lions jaguars and leopards this color variant usually means that the cat is black or dark brown since melanism is the development of melanin a darkcolored pigment in the skin a panther is therefore usually either a black leopard in asia and africa known as panthera pardus or a black jaguar in the americas known as panthera onca a panther’s black skin is genetic melanism can be a useful evolutionary process panther facts show that the darker individuals in a species are often better camouflaged and therefore more likely to survive and reproduce this is particularly true in certain natural conditions for example in regions of dense forest with little light where instances of melanism are more common in the panthera onca the type of panther that comes from the jaguar species melanism is therefore conferred through a dominant gene this means that black jaguars can have either black or spotted cubs but normal jaguars only produce regular spotted cubs panthers are native to 3 different continents since panthers come from different species of big cat there is a wide variety of panther facts relating to the environments which they can inhabit black leopards are common in africa and asia they are found in locations with dense vegetation such as the slopes of african mountain ranges mount kenya for example and tropical forests in areas of china nepal sri lanka malaysia and indonesia black jaguars on the other hand prefer wet lowlands and savannahs as well as rainforests they are found mainly in central and south america for example in the amazon rainforest panthers were once present in north america but have not officially resided on the continent for a long time there are however frequent but unconfirmed sightings of panthers in north america the panther is a stealthy hunter dark fur is a great camouflage for panther panthers are carnivorous and generally prey upon small to mediumsized herbivores although exactly which species depends on the environment they are in animals which can form a part of their diet include antelope deer warthog tapir wild boar rabbits and birds there are many panther facts relating to this animal’s formidable hunting prowess one of the biggest factors that distinguishes panthers from other big cats is their stealth panthers are nocturnal so hunt at night their dark fur allows them to seamlessly camouflage with their surroundings while their excellent eyesight and sense of smell help them to locate prey panthers generally hunt on the ground but have been known to ambush prey from trees panthers are incredibly quick and strong as well as their camouflage ability there are many other panther facts which add up to make this big cat one fearsome predator panthers can run at speeds of up to 35 mph helping them to catch up with fast prey such as deer and antelope they are also incredibly agile and are able to leap up to 20 ft in pursuit of their prey another one of the more unique panther facts relates to their climbing ability of all the big cats panthers are some of the very best at climbing they often use trees to their advantage whether for hiding in for safety or for watching and ambushing prey in addition their strong jaws enable them to drag heavy prey into the branches of trees in order to feed safely panthers only socialize during mating season there are some intriguing panther facts relating to their behavior the panther is a very solitary animal and usually lives hunts and travels alone the one exception to this rule is during the mating season when she is ready to mate the female panther will leave scent markings for the male to follow and also makes a sawing sound to let him know where she is after they have mated the pair will rarely stay together for more than a few days the age of sexual maturity for the female panther is usually around 2 years and she will have her first litter at around 2 12 years old the male panther is also capable of mating at the age of 2 but because of fierce competition from older males does not usually have the opportunity until he is 3 or 4 years old it is common for fights to break out among male panthers during mating season panthers are pregnant for 3 months the gestation period for a female panther is around 3 months and results in a litter of 24 cubs being born panthers usually give birth in a safe den the male plays no part in the raising of panther cubs which stay with their mother for almost 2 years when they are very young cubs are small and vulnerable and are blind for the first 2 weeks of their lives during this time predator attacks upon the den can threaten their lives particularly when the mother is out hunting after a few months however the cubs are ready to accompany their mother one of the more extraordinary panther facts regards just how quickly these young panthers learn after just 23 months the cubs learn to hunt and by the age of 9 months they are able to bring down mediumsized prey panther cubs are not always born to panther parents however since the panther color variant is caused by a dominant gene in jaguars and a recessive gene in leopards in either case it can occur in litters of normal jaguar or leopard cubs this means that a leopard mother for example could give birth to a litter of both normal spotted leopards and black leopards panthers panthers are extremely rare panther population one of the more somber panther facts is that these animals are extremely rare this is partly because of genetics but also because these magnificent creatures and their habitats are at risk increasingly so in recent times human activity such as industrial deforestation is greatly reducing the amount of territory available for these big cats to live on furthermore the hunting of panthers for their fur or for other trophies has caused a vast decline in their numbers along with those of regular leopards and jaguars panthers are now so rare and so stealthy that they are rarely seen by humans at all for this reason they are known as the ghosts of the forest panthers are now considered to be endangered since although they are not a distinct species both leopards and jaguars are considered to be threatened lorenz oken was the first to describe the panthera species there are many interesting historical panther facts it is believed that the genus panthera originally evolved in asia although its exact roots remain unclear members of this genus probably diverged from their subfamily felinae around 610 million years ago during the last two centuries we have learned more and more biological panther facts which have helped to classify these creatures in 1816 the german naturalist lorenz oken considering the felidae family as a whole distinguished the panthera genus as separate in 1816 the british taxonomist reginald pocock extended and refined these classifications concluding that the genus contained jaguars leopards tigers and lions he came to this conclusion after studying skulls and skins in london’s natural history museum a panther’s markings are visible through its black coat since panthers are defined by the melanin in their skin when we think of panther facts we tend to imagine a large black or dark brown cat this is accurate unless you look very closely on closer examination panthers have the same markings as their leopard and jaguar peers with the pattern visible through the darkness of the coat this effect is known as “ghost striping” and has a similar appearance to printed silk mystery surrounds the ‘north american black panther’while there are many interesting panther facts these animals also inspire a large amount of speculation in north america for example there have been many sightings of black cats through the ages which believers claim are melanistic cougars however no black cougar or mountain lion has ever been photographed shot or bred in north america and experts generally agree that it does not exist any such reports are attributed to mistaken identity or mistakes about the size of the creature this makes the north american black panther a cryptid that is an animal whose existence is not proven or an animal known to exist but alleged to be in an unexpected place there have been ‘big black cat’ sightings in unlikely places us cougar sightings map these unconfirmed – but regular – reports of black cat sightings in strange places are not just confined to north america in great britain there are over a 1000 reports of large black cat sightings each year while experts remain skeptical about the existence of a panther population in britain there is an argument that many exotic animals may survive in the british countryside as a result of the dangerous wild animals act of 1976 this act placed heavy restrictions on the ownership of exotic pets and could have meant many large cats were released into the wild at once in australia too there are many rumors of big cat populations the blue mountains panther for example is one of these phantom cats many argue that this panther is descended from escapees of a zoo or circus there is another theory that black panthers were used as military mascots for american soldiers in world war ii who were stationed in australia believers argue that the mascot panthers escaped and began to live in the australian wild panthers are excellent swimmers one of the more surprising panther facts tells us just how much these creatures like water unlike most domestic pet cats the panthera pardus descended from leopards is not a fan of the water but it is a very different story for the panthera onca these black jaguars love to swim and their preferred habitat includes flooded forests and swampy wetlands but more than this they also swim recreationally and can spend a significant portion of their time cooling off swimming playing and relaxing in water in ancient mythology the panther was multicolored forget joseph’s technicolor dream coat it was the panther who had the most impressive hide in ancient times when searching for panther facts in the realms of mythology we can find many interesting interpretations of this fearsome beast and its behavior in various european mythologies the panther was a multicolored beast that feasted on the flesh of many creatures then retreated to a cave to sleep for 3 days when the beast awoke it would let out a roar and a sweet smelling odor would fill the air drawing all nearby creatures to the panther’s lair so that it could feast once again only the dragon was immune to the panther’s sweetsmelling but deadly breath glasgow zoo had a cobweb panther since panthers are rare and magnificent any panther in captivity is a popular sight but there are panther facts relating to one special former inhabitant of glasgow zoo that are quite extraordinary in the 1980s the zoo acquired a black leopard that was 10 years of age this panther had a condition known as vitiligo which caused her black fur to be covered with thin white hairs this made the panther look as if she had become tangled in fine cobwebs ‘cobweb panther’ as she was consequently nicknamed became famous she was a popular exhibit in britain before being moved to madrid there are ‘panthers’ in baseball football basketball and ice hockey there are many panther facts relating to the use of the name and the idea of this creature in the world of sport the panther is one of the most popular and enduring symbols in united states sports with teams in various sporting disciplines incorporating the panther into their name and as a mascot such teams include the pittsburg panthers athletic teams carolina panthers in football florida panthers in ice hockey and the milwaukee panthers in basketball the use of the panther as a symbol is hardly surprising these animals have many qualities which are important in sport including strength agility endurance ingenuity and competitiveness the florida panther is not a real panther florida panther range – historic and current when it comes to panther facts there can be confusion about what exactly counts as a panther and this is often a linguistic issue the florida panther for example is actually a kind of cougar which lives in the swamps and forests of florida the species is known by many names including mountain lion cougar and puma in southern florida however locals exclusively call it a panther this is not very surprising since the word “panther” has a complicated history there are many variations from the old french pantere to the latin panthera the latin word pardus means leopard but throughout history the words panthera and pardus were used often interchangeably since the panther itself is not a distinct species and the word “panther” is used in various circumstances it is not surprising that most people have some of their panther facts mixed upthe love of lola and diablo created the jaglion one of the more heartwarming and also bizarre panther facts relates to how jazhara the panther and her brother tsunami came into being at canada’s bear creek wildlife sanctuary a lioness named lola and a black jaguar named diablo were acquired within weeks of each other and were raised in close quarters attempts to separate the two as they got older resulted in both animals exhibiting signs of distress − lola even refused to eat the couple were housed together again and the result was something that many who knew their panther facts didn’t believe was possible two jaglion cubs were born in 2006 a male tsunami who is tancolored and spotted and a female jazhara who is a charcoal colored panther panther facts – facts about panthers summary there are many intriguing panther facts about these magnificent and secretive creatures a panther is a melanistic color variant of other species of big cat usually a leopard or a jaguar they are black or dark brown in color and inhabit forests wetlands and grasslands panthers are very rare and are also stealthy and solitary creatures meaning that humans do not generally come into direct contact with them they are expert hunters using their impressive climbing jumping and running skills to hunt down medium to largesized herbivores the panther inspires a great deal of speculation in us perhaps because of its secretive and mysterious nature frequent panther sightings are reported all around the world even where no panthers are proven to live no related posts comments
