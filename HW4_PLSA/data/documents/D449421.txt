hours to 72 hours and obs practitioners were required to report two additional adverse events unplanned emergency department visits within seventy–two hours of officebased surgery and unscheduled assignment to observation services within a hospital occurring within seventy–two hours of officebased surgery3 what is officebased surgery public health law phl §§ 230d defines officebased surgery as any surgical or other invasive procedure requiring general anesthesia moderate sedation or deep sedation and any liposuction procedure where such surgical or other invasive procedure or liposuction is performed by a licensee in a location other than a hospital as such term is defined in article twentyeight of this chapter excluding minor procedures and procedures requiring minimal sedation see definitions of sedation at question 8 below for the purposes of obs the doh has adopted the following definition of invasive procedures invasive procedures are procedures performed for diagnostic or treatment purposes which involve puncture penetration or incision of the skin insertion of an instrument through the skin or a natural orifice or insertion of foreign material other than medication into the body invasive procedures include but are not limited to the injection of contrast materials such as used for an mri or ct scans when these imaging procedures are accompanied by moderate or deep sedation major upper or lower extremity nerve blocks neuraxial or general anesthesia the obs law initially defined licensee as an individual licensed or otherwise authorized under articles one hundred thirtyone or one hundred thirtyoneb of the education law individuals licensed under these laws include physicians physician assistants and specialist assistants in 2012 the definition of licensees in the obs law was expanded to include podiatrists licensed under article one hundred fortyone of education law and privileged by the state education department to perform ankle surgery a phl article 28 facility refers to licensed hospitals which are established operated and regulated under public health law article 28 and the doh regulations in title 10 of the codes rules and regulations of the state of new york the term hospital as defined in phl § 2801 1 includes acute care or general hospitals nursing homes diagnostic and treatment centers and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers article 28 licensed facilities are not subject to the obs law and accredited obs practices are not subject to phl article 28 the obs law defines minor procedures as  i procedures that can be performed safely with a minimum of discomfort where the likelihood of complications requiring hospitalization is minimal ii procedures performed with local or topical anesthesia or iii liposuction with removal of less than 500 ml of fat under unsupplemented local anesthesia any invasive or surgical procedure performed by a physician or a podiatrist performing ankle surgery requiring more than minimal sedation andor local or topical anesthesia to complete or attain sufficient patient comfort does not meet the criteria for the minor procedure exemption as defined in the obs statute and should therefore be performed in an article 28 licensed facility or an accredited obs practice in addition neither neuraxial anesthesia nor major upper or lower extremity nerve blocks are equivalent to the local or topical anesthesia exemption identified in the definition of minor procedure and should therefore be performed in an article 28 licensed facility or an accredited obs practice officebased surgery procedures4 can you give examples of procedures that are within the definition of obs examples of procedures that are obs include but are not limited to upper endoscopy colonoscopy rhinoplasty mammoplasty lithotripsy or vascular access related procedures when accompanied by moderate or deep sedation major upper or lower extremity nerve blocks neuraxial or general anesthesia most procedures like botulinum toxin injections and minor integumentary procedures are performed with minimal or no sedation and therefore can be performed in offices not requiring obs accreditation generally magnetic resonance imaging mri procedures are not subject to this law however mris and other imaging studies that involve administration of intravenous contrast must be performed in an accredited obs office if the patient involved receives moderate or deep sedation major upper or lower extremity nerve blocks neuraxial or general anesthesia5 are there any limits on the types or complexity of procedures that can be performed in an officebased surgery setting as previously noted liposuction is the only procedure specifically mentioned in the obs law general limits on the types and complexity of procedures that can be performed in an obs setting are determined by the ability to 1 perform the procedure ssurgery s safely with minimum discomfort 2 respond to known proceduralsurgical and sedationanesthesia related complications appropriately in a timely manner and 3 where the likelihood of complications requiring hospitalization is minimal the safety of performing specific procedure s on a specific patient is driven by each individual patients health status medical history and risks procedures that may be safe and appropriate for one patient in an obs setting may not be for another patient with a different past medical history and risks as noted above any invasive or surgical procedure performed by a physician or a podiatrist performing ankle surgery requiring more than minimal sedation andor local or topical anesthesia to complete or attain sufficient patient comfort does not meet the criteria for the minor procedure exemption defined in the obs statute and should therefore be performed in an article 28 licensed facility or an accredited obs practice the obs law does not place time limits on operative or postprocedure time for patients undergoing obs procedures however doh obs advisors recommend that obs procedures be limited to those with an expected operativeprocedural time of less than six hours and that obs patients requiring the services of the postanesthesia care unit longer than six hours be transferred to a higher level of care6 do i need to get obs accredited in order to provide officebased ultrarapid opiate detoxification the nys department of health together with nys office of alcoholism and substance abuse services oasas and the new york city department of health and mental hygiene nyc dohmh have issued an advisory stating that ultrarapid opiate detoxification urod also known as anesthesia assisted rapid opiate detoxification aarod is not a safe modality for the treatment of opiate dependence and advises practitioners against its use7 what procedures are excluded from obs phl § 230d identifies that obs does not include minor procedures and procedures accompanied by minimal sedation the statute defines minor procedures as i procedures that can be performed with a minimum of discomfort where the likelihood of complications requiring hospitalization is minimal and ii procedures performed with local or topical anesthesia or iii liposuction with removal of less than 500 ml of fat under unsupplemented local anesthesia except for liposuction the law does not mention any procedure by name the determination of whether a particular procedure is obs is based on whether or not a surgical or invasive procedure is accompanied by moderate or deeper sedation major upper or lower extremity nerve blocks neuraxial or general anesthesia please note the sedation level is based on the effect of the medication s on the patient and is not related to any particular drug dose or route of administration see question 8 for definitions of sedation officebased surgery sedationanesthesia8 what is meant by the term sedation phl § 230d identifies the first four 4 levels of sedation listed below consistent with the definitions of the american society of anesthesiologists asa when moderate sedation deep sedation major upper or lower nerve blocks neuraxial or general anesthesia is provided in conjunction with performance of an invasive or surgical medical procedure or ankle surgery performed by a privileged podiatrist the office should be obs accredited procedures performed with minimal sedation do not require accreditation the levels of sedation used in obs which require accreditation are moderate sedationanalgesia – a druginduced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation no interventions are required to maintain a patent airway and spontaneous ventilation is adequate cardiovascular function is usually maintained without assistance deep sedationanalgesia – is a druginduced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation the ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impaired patients may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate cardiovascular function is usually maintained without assistance general anesthesia – is a druginduced loss of consciousness during which patients are not arousable even by painful stimulation the ability to independently maintain ventilatory function is often impaired patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airway and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous ventilation or druginduced depression of neuromuscular function cardiovascular function may be impaired neuraxial anesthesia is a form of regional anesthesia in which pain sensation is modified or blocked by administration of medication into the epidural space or spinal canal major upper and lower extremity nerve blocks are types of regional anesthesia in which pain sensation is modified or blocked to a large area of the extremity by the administration of medication around the nerves supplying that region of the extremity  reflex withdrawal from a painful stimulus is not considered a purposeful response it is the intended impactlevel of sedation of the patient that determines the need for accreditation and provision of care consistent with asa standards please note that neither specific medications nor specific routes of administration are mentioned in the statute or the asa definitions health care professionals subject to the obs laws9 what health care professions are subject to the obs laws presently phl § 230d applies to physicians physician assistants and specialist assistants as of february 17 2014 the obs law also applies to podiatrists privileged by the state education department to perform ankle surgery this law does not apply to procedures performed by dentists podiatrists not performing ankle surgery or other health care professionals education law and regulation identify the training and certification requirements that must be followed by dentists in order for them to prescribe andor administer moderate or deep sedation in addition the state education department has issued officebased surgery and conscious sedation guidelines that apply to podiatrists these can be found athttpwwwopnysedgovprofdentdentlichtmdentanes and httpwwwopnysedgovprofpodpodiatryguidesedationhtm there are practitioners who are dually licensed as both dentists and physicians all physicians are affected by this law and therefore a dually licensed mddds or mddmd when performing procedures that fall within the scope of practice of medicine in conjunction with the identified levels and types of sedationanesthesia discussed above may only perform these procedures in an obs accredited practice and follow reporting requirements a dually licensed mddds or mddmd when performing procedures that fall within the scope of practice of dentistry is not required to accredit their practice officebased surgery accreditation10 who are the accrediting agencies determined by the commissioner and how can i contact them the determined accrediting agencies are american association for accreditation of ambulatory surgery facilities aaaasf 5101 washington street suite 2f gurnee il

il 60181wwwjointcommissionorg11 how were the nationally recognized accrediting agencies determined the accrediting agencies were chosen through a process which involved a written application and interview designated agencies were chosen based on their standards experience and accreditation processes in selecting the accrediting agencies doh required that the agencies have standards in various relevant categories each of the designated accrediting agencies demonstrated to the satisfaction of doh that they had appropriate standards and acceptable processes in place for evaluating compliance with those standards standards of the agencies that were determined by doh to accredit obs practices are not identical it should be noted however that nys has patient safety legislation that requires licensed practitioners to follow specific infection control practices that are somewhat more specific than the infection control standards of the obs accrediting agencies for further information see the link belowhttpwwwhealthnygovprofessionalsdiseasesreportingcommunicableinfection12 what must be accredited private practices that perform officebased surgery as defined by phl § 230d must be obs accredited by one of doh designated accrediting agencies see faq question  10 multiple aspects of practices seeking to provide officebased surgery are evaluated and surveyed as part of the accreditation process including but not limited to the legal structure of the practice the education training and licensure of physicians podiatrists and other health care practitioners providing care to patients policies procedures and protocols used to guide selection and care of patients and operations of the practice physical plant and equipment used in the care of patients etc all office locations of the obs practice must be accredited and anyall new locations where obs will be performed must be accredited before any obs procedures are performed13 are there architectural requirements for officebased practices obs practices must follow the accrediting agencys standards and expectations for physical plant requirements these requirements include standards for procedure rooms the need for soiled and clean utility space standards for preop and recovery sterilization facilities emergency power oxygen suction and gas among other things additionally localities have occupancy requirements based upon the type of occupancies that set standards for building construction fire and life safety the localmunicipal requirements may have limitations on the number of persons rendered incapable of taking action for selfpreservation under emergency conditions without assistance from others or are under the effects of deep sedation or general anesthesia at any one time14 applicants for obs accreditation are asked about their organizational structure why are those questions asked the accrediting agencies ask those questions to verify that practices seeking obs accreditation are structured as an entity that is legally authorized to practice medicine or podiatry in the state of new york in new york state physicians may conduct the private practice of medicine when they are one of the following sole practitioner professional corporation all of the shareholders officers and directors must be physicians professional limited liability company all of the members and managers must be physicians or university faculty practice corporation all of the officers and directors must be physicians general partnership all of the partners must be physicians registered limited liability partnership all of the partners must be physicians likewise a podiatry practice seeking accreditation must be structured as an entity that is legally authorized to practice podiatry15 can a licensee perform a single surgical procedure involving moderate or deeper sedation without becoming accredited no if the plan is to perform an invasive or surgical procedure while administering moderate or deep sedation major upper or lower extremity nerve blocks neuraxial or general anesthesia then accreditation is required prior to the performance of the procedure practices in the process of attaining obs accreditation may not perform procedures involving the noted types or levels of sedation or anesthesia prior to receiving official notification of obs accreditation from a doh designated accrediting agency16 under what circumstances does an accredited obs practice need to contact their accrediting agency each accrediting agency has standards that address when a practice must contact them a few examples include when it is time to seek reaccreditation or to submit changesupdates regarding the practice such as when new licensees physicians or podiatrists or services are added and when a new office location is being established17 can an accredited obs practice sell or give away their accreditation no an accredited obs practice cannot sell or give away their accreditation18 do the obs laws apply to practices referred to as urgent care if the practice is not a licensed public health law article 28 facility eg a diagnostic and treatment center clinic ambulatory surgery center or hospital and the private medical practice provides urgent care that involves invasive or surgical procedures performed with more than minimal sedation it is performing officebased surgery and is subject to the obs laws19 is a physician who performs officebased surgery and practices in a university faculty practice corporation subject to the obs laws yes the definition of officebased surgery in public health law § 230d 1 h states in pertinent part that the law applies when liposuction or any surgical or invasive procedure requiring at least a moderate level of sedation is performed in a location other than a hospital as such term is defined in article twentyeight of this chapter a university faculty practice corporation is a notforprofit corporation organized under section 1412 of the notforprofit corporation law that is affiliated with but not part of a hospital established under article twentyeight of the public health law because the corporation is not part of the hospital with which it is affiliated its offices constitute locations other than a hospital therefore obs performed by faculty practice corporations must be in compliance with the obs laws including obs accreditation we are aware that there are instances in which there is a university faculty practice plan without this corporate structure in those instances in which the practices are structured as separate professional corporations those professional corporations that perform obs will need to be accredited in those circumstances in which the practices are not structured as separate entities those practices within the school that perform obs will need to be accredited as the specialty practice of x school or college20 must tissue banks become accredited under the obs law yes in some circumstances tissue banks are regulated under public health law phl article 43b and must be licensed by the commissioner of health through the wadsworth centers blood and tissue resources program tissue banks operating out of physician offices that collect tissue such as oocytes andor transplant tissue under moderate or deep sedation major upper or lower extremity nerve blocks neuraxial or general anesthesia must become accredited pursuant to the obs law tissue bank licensure does not supplant the accreditation requirement21 will the department of health provide a list of obs accredited practices on the doh web site how do i find out if an obs practice is accredited the doh web site posts a list of accredited obs practices identifying the

federal or state guidelines addressing the issue of advance directives in obs practices federal law requires all providers including physicians in private practice which would include obs practices to ask their patients whether they have any advance directives – mainly a health care proxy if the patient requests information on advance directives the providers should be prepared to either give them such information or refer them to the doh web site which has this information wwwhealthnygov  the doh advises persons who have completed a health care proxy form to bring a copy with them if they are having any type of obs procedure the obs practice should reiterate this as part of their preop instructions if the patient does not have a completed health care proxy form and would like to complete one before surgery the obs practice should either have the forms routinely available or should download a form from the doh web site the patient can then complete the form and obs staff can witness the patients signature there is no legal prohibition on staff members of a physician practice or an article 28 facility from witnessing a patients health care proxy the only person s who are legally

sharing their accredited space with a physician or other licensed practitioner then the practice should be careful to ensure that it is not subject to enforcement action as a scofflaw article 28 facility34 can an accredited officebased surgery practice be located at the same site as a licensed ambulatory surgery center no an article 28 licensed facility such as an asc may not share space with an obs practice the colocation of an asc and an obs practice at the same site is inconsistent with article 28 and title 10 nycrr § 4012 approval of an asc and issuance of an operating certificate pursuant to the article 28 and related doh regulations is site specific the approved operator must have exclusive site control and responsibility for phl and regulatory compliance by the licensed facility the operator may not share site control with an entity not licensed under phl article 28 such as a private practice colocation by an asc and an obs practice would also conflict with phl § 230d 1 h which defines officebased surgery as any surgical or other invasive procedure requiring general anesthesia…where such surgical or other invasive procedure or liposuction is performed by a licensee in a location other than a hospital as such term is defined in article twentyeight of this chapter the statutory definition of office based surgery is indicative of a legislative intent that an obs practice is located at a site other than an article 28 site reimbursement35 does obs accreditation qualify a private obs practice to receive a facility fee phl § 230d does not address or require reimbursement of an obs facility fee accreditation status does not require a third party insurer to pay a facility fee an obs practice is not a health care facility under phl article 28 or as

professional misconduct36 an anesthesiologist is engaged to administer moderate sedation to patients undergoing invasive or surgical procedure s is the anesthesiologist required to assure that heshe is practicing in an accredited practice or potentially be found guilty of professional misconduct yes the practitioner should determine the accreditation status of a practice prior to administering anesthesia or becoming affiliated with the practice if practicing in a non officebased surgery accredited office practice that is performing procedures meeting the definition of officebased surgery the anesthesiologist and the proceduralists are subject to charges of professional misconduct physicians practicing as anesthesiologists in private offices where invasive or surgical procedures involving moderate sedation deep sedation major upper or lower extremity nerve blocks neuraxial or general anesthesia are being performed must practice in an accredited officebased surgery practice unless the procedure is not within the definition of officebased surgery or the procedure is to be performed in a setting not required to have officebased surgery accreditation ie an ambulatory
