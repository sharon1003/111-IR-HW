weeks out at four days postop you are still a cocktail of drugs and anesthesia and gas so that is what you will be feeling right now once you start sipping anything stronger than clear liquids you will most definitely be able totell when enough is enough for me i felt that with clears too i suppose every persons signal is different but for me that early out it was very painful pressure in the spot where the new stomach is if i took too large a gulp i would feel that same pain but instead it would be in my esophagus if you are worried that you will find a way to cheat the sleeve because there is no real dumping dont worry pain is a very good behavior modifier and once you are on solids there is the risk of sliming a hideous experience i recently had with a food i have already eaten postop crafty christie bariatric master lapband patients621177 posts posted september 4 2010okay firstly my friend i want you to hear this you did not fail at the band the band failed you you did not fail at diets diets failed you this is important because you are placing blame and guilt on yourself that you do not deserve secondly i was also very hungry the first two weeks after my sleeve it seems hit or miss some people deal with hunger and some dont my hubby and i both did so did my friend who is almost 3 weeks post op right now its okay it sucks but you will get through it while you are in this liquids phase you wont feel too much restriction unless you chug stuff which you probably wont huh0 once you get on soft foods you will start to feel it and even more so on solid foods if you eat a bite too many you will feel pressure in your chest like a bad heartburn or just a major pressure in your sternum its very uncomfortable and once you have felt it a few times you learn to stop eating before you get to that point the nutritionists and nurses in our surgeons office stress you do not want to feel that you want to stop eating before you feel it you will experience it most in the first couple of weeks on solid foods when you are learning i have only felt it once in the past month and a half when i accidentally ate too much turkey it was only 2 oz i can usually eat more than that thats the other thing is different foods will make you feel different you cant always eat the same amount even if it seems similar chicken and turkey pretty similar but it affected me differently also 2 oz of chicken might fit comfortably today and not tomorrow so treat every meal like its the first and proceed carefully hang in there the hunger gets better promisecarrie junior

4 2010well i wouldnt say get used to it in a week or two it will be much better little steve guru in training lapband patients3282 posts posted september 4 2010your stomach has stretch receptors so when food touches them a message is sent to the brain telling you to stop eating i believe you just have to relearn what full iswhen i am eating i can go from hungry to the i dont want any more very quickly i have to stop right then or i get the cant move for a week feeling for me its very obvious easy to anticipate and satisfying i also still get hungry and eat every 23 hrs but for some reason and without trying i no longer crave junk foodredheadedpamela newbie gastric sleeve patients08 posts posted september 5 2010thanks so much for the good words i guess i just thought it would be more drastic than this and yes i guess once i did sort of chug some liquids and it felt funny in one spot for a second like one cramp of gas i have a 36 bouggi sp that stick they use for sizing your stomach to stitch around but i really wanted a 32 but doc wouldnt do it said he used to use 32 and people couldnt swallow ive heard this sleeve gets to feeling more and more natural in the weeks to follow but right now i can still swig 3 or 4 swallows of water from a bottle of water just like ive always been able to lets see maybe ill lose a lot of weight in my arms and legs

not being a success with the band nuh uh we needed these surgeries for a reason when you have something that is way too easy to cheat you better believe most of us will be cheating i love the idea with the sleeve of only eating 2oz of meat and that will be it it will be such a blessingthinoneday sleeve believer lapband patients4226254 posts posted september 6 2010redheadedpamela said bloated too of course there must be something im not getting when i had the lapband i knew if i overate or came close to it because it would come back up but what happens with the sleeve what feelings do you get when you know you shouldnt eat anymore i am so scared that i will fail at this too pam trust me you will know  you get this weird extremely full like you ate the whole turkey dinner feeling after about 4 oz of solid food   the bad thing however is that you can wait for about 2 hours and then eat again  this can go on forever this is where you have to relearn your bad habits   after you eat your meal you have be strong enough to wait until the next meal  if you feel hungry inbetween meals you need to drink water crystal light diet cokes or whatever but dont snack   after a while you can throw in a fresh peeled fruit   im 8 months out and have to so watch what im doing   its so easy to go back to bad habits right now im fighting night eating  its tough but im winning the battle   havent gained anything thank god but the weight loss is really slow   good luckouroborous superfreak lapband patients5182152 posts posted september 8 2010first 32 fr bougie to 36 fr bougie is an almost imperceptible difference trust me going from a 32 to a 36 didnt sabotage your weight loss second the sensation of hunger is very different for everyone  both presleeve and postsleeve one thing thats really hit me is that im hungry a lot these days but i just dont eat that much its like ive learned to turn it off or at least down i have to remind myself to eat and thats newid recommend that you not worry about it too much from what ive seen of the sleeve you will lose weight has there been a single person on here whos had the sleeve who hasnt lost a significant amount of weight it will surprise you the rate that it comes off then plateaus then comes off again it will surprise you how much your relationship to food and yes you have a relationship to food will change just focus on getting well right now  follow the doctors orders to the letter sip water whenever you can walk as much as you can try to wean off of the pain meds and really listen to the new sensations in your body you will literally have to relearn how to eat and drink all over again but the payoff is worth it maddie bariatric master gastric sleeve patients91761 posts posted september 8 2010i see you have
