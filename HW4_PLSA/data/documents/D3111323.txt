property damage liability rather than separate limits which would then pay up to a single maximum amount for all damages caused by one accident regardless of how many persons are injured eg 100000 300000 or 500000 b property damage liability although the requirement for third party property damage liability coverage is currently 10000 many cars today are worth far more given the high cost of automobile replacement andor repair the purchase of property damage liability limits higher than the required minimum limit of 10000 should be considered by insureds property damage limits of 15000 25000 50000 and higher are generally available for an additional premium c additional pip nofault benefits it is often smart to buy more nofault protection over the basic 50000 minimum coverage limit of nofault benefits required by law because of nofaultâ€™s costeffective design extended nofault benefits represent a relatively inexpensive option for a modest additional premium optional coverages are available that will pay more than the required basic nofault benefits explained in minimum auto insurance requirements consumers now have two choices you may purchase additional pip coverage to raise the overall limit of nofault benefits available in case of an accident up to 100000 or higher and in the process increase the potential maximum amounts of lost earnings payments other necessary

economic loss coverage by an additional 25000 when the basic limit of 50000 has been reached on a claim this 25000 can be designated by the injured person to be applied specifically to payments for loss of earnings from work wage loss for rehabilitation or to all elements of basic economic loss neither of these two additional nofault coverage options lengthens the threeyear limit within which wage loss benefits are payable the availability of these nofault options makes optional medical payments coverage see below no longer as important as it had been because that coverage except for funeral expenses responds only if nofault does not cover the situation or after nofault benefits when applicable are first exhausted d supplementary uninsuredunderinsured motorists sum coverage as
