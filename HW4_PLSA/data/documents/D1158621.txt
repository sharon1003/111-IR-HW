the firm alicia tells her to undercut kurt so she can represent her client peter as best as possible after everything that happened between kurt and diane in the last episode dianes hesitation is understandable and as she argues kurt cant be undercut diane tells alicia to have peter fire her and then alicia taps lucca for kurts crossexamination and she doesnt throw her boss husband any

to talk to him alicia and will had such bad history with missed calls and voicemails the season one finale wills death will the same be true for her and jason the series last scene is eerily similar to its first peter at a press conference announcing his resignation and his plea deal and thanking everyone for their support most importantly his wife alicia then thinks she sees jason and runs into the back hallway only to find a random man and then to find diane and just like she once slapped peter in the pilot diane slaps her good really good alicia is at once emotional but then resolute and
