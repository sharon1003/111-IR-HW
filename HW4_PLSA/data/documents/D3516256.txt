time ever i will not be flying non stop i dont know how to choose from the many layover options available for my rt ny to albuquerque flights the layovers range from 30 minutes to 3 12 hours in cities as diverse as baltimore minneapolis and atlanta how much time is needed how can you even know that when you dont know how close the gates are what happens if the first flight is delayed causing you to miss the second flight does the airline put you on the next flight out if the next flight is the next day do they put you in a hotel your help is appreciated report inappropriate content110 of 10

one ticket with a connection or are you talking about two independent tickets one ticket with a connectionif the airline offers itit is legal on your owntwo ticketsleave time on one ticket i personally dont like the flights that cut it to close  30 minutes you may make it but your luggage may not also if the airline decides you missed the flight because you dallied you are on your own pick one with 4560 minutes go directly from the first plane to the second and youll be okay if you miss the flight because of the airlinethey are responsible for you you will be put on the first

connections just book something with a longer connection i would imagine you would have options from nycabq on united or frontier through denver delta through either atlanta or minneapolis continental through houston if those are your choices msp or den would offer the easiest connection as youll nearly always stay on the same concourse atlanta or houston would potentially be the most complex for you good luck report inappropriate contentgaryfam new york level contributor287 posts4 reviews save reply3 re how much time to allow for layover mar 6 2011 848 amthis will be one ticket one airline with a connection due to my intense dislike of the md80 and my refusal to fly regional airlines after that flight to buffalo ditched 2 years ago with pilots who had too little experience  too little sleep it looks like i am limited to delta and southwest delta has an 8 am flight out of jfk that has a 1 hr 28 minute layover in minneapolis that sounds like a reasonable time and i found a southwest flight home that has a stop but does not require a plane change  so that is definitely my first choice for that leg of the trip for the future it looks like i should become more aware of layover practices what happens if the connection is missed due to a delayed first flight and you have to wait till the next day thanks for your help report inappropriate content gopbibangkok destination

to a delayed first flight and you have to wait till the next day commonly if the reason for the missed connection is the carriers direct fault and as a result you are a forced overnight many will put you up at a hotel at their expense but each airline is different youd have to read your specific airlines contract of carriage to see exactly what you are entitled to naturally they can exceed these entitlements but cannot go lower than that travel safereport inappropriate contenttat1964pittsburgh level contributor34 posts4 reviews save reply5 re how much time to allow for layover mar 8 2011 312 pmwhile it is true that if you miss a flight because of issues with the airline they will put you up at a hotel you are still not going to be where you paid to be my wife and i just got back from a trip to houston where we missed our connection due to plane issues they did put us on the next flight lucky for us that flight wasnt full but we were two hours later getting to houston than we wanted to be we also had that happen to us on our honeymoon and were not lucky enough to get on the only other flight leaving that day we will always allow for at least 2 hours between flights because the only plane that takes off on time is the one you are going to be late for report inappropriate contentgaryfam new york level contributor287 posts4 reviews save reply6 re how much time to allow for layover mar 8 2011 631 pmtat1964  the only plane that takes off on time is the one you are going to be late for i like that line so do you think that the 1 hr 28 minute layover i will have in minneapolis on my outbound delta flight wont be enough i specifically chose this flight because another poster told me which airports to avoid and which would be an easier connection i was planning on booking tonight coming home i am opting for a southwest flight because it is direct and i will not have to make a connection when it makes its stop travel time is much shorter and it leaves at a sane hour too i just wish that more nonstop flights were offered these days report inappropriate content tumbleweedand cactus park city utah destination expertfor utah winter sports level contributor19750

connection in msp do note though if you dont like flying regional carriers you might be further challenged other than southwest i would be really surprised if you had a connection routing that didnt have a regional carrier operating at least one of the segments  especially into a market like abq look at the flight numbers and the itinerary which will tell you whos actually flying the segment

flight legs most search engines do that unless there are no connections for a particular routing i checked faretex flight search system and there are definitely lots of possible connections and you do not need to think if you have enough time or not the system does this for youif the flight search system gives you the flights with connections the mct minimum connecting time is usually met so you

carefully and yes many of the legs were flown by regional carriers or on planes i dont like but i found several that met my specifications and those were the ones i booked the delta flights are on an airbus and a 737 and are both delta flights not regionals southwest has all 737s and doesnt seem to link up with any regional carriers faretex  i only looked at flight combos that came up on my searches of nyc to abq  i did not attempt to put the legs of the trip together on my own the system gave me some connection times of 30 minutes that was just too short for me even a delay getting a gate after the first flight lands could scuttle that connection let alone bad weather here or at the layover airport i have now booked my flights and i will keep my fingers and toes crossed thanks to
