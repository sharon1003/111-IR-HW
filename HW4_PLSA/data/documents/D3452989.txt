printer name mean 3m see if this works  make sure mac address filtering isnt enabled on the router that can prevent devices joining a network im assuming the printer has a control panel and neither the router or the printer support wps pairing if they do post back cos that can make it very easy youll need to know the wifi encryption method your router is set to and your wifi password this may not be the exact sequence as the menus on printers vary from make to make but the process seems to be similar across brands press the menu button on the printer and select network select wlan and it should offer a setup wizard or similar from there is should display your network select it encryption type select it youll then need to input your password normally by using the updown and leftright arrows ok it when done and voila hopefully youll be connected then on the mac in system preferences print scan you should be able to add the printer sometimes but not always ive found that ive had to
