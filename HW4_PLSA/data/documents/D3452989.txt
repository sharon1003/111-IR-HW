lock symbol indicates that the permissions on the photos are set for your access only the lock padlock overlay icon appears for filesfolders which are private but located under a nonprivate directory if a standard user tries to access the folder with a lock icon they will get a popup that says “you don’t currently have permission to access this folder click on continue to permanently get access to this folder”there are two ways of removing the lock icon method 1 a right click on the folder and click on “properties” b go to the tab “sharing” c click on “share” d select the usergroup from the dropdown eg everyone if you want to share it with everyone and then click on share to remove the lock from the folder the usergroup “everyone” will have access to the folder then the folder no longer has special permissions and windows 7 will therefore remove the lock icon method 2 a right click on the folder and click on“properties” b go to the tab “security” c click on the “advanced” button at the bottom d click on “change permission” e select your user account and check the option “include inheritable permissions from this object’s parent” f click on apply to remove the lock icon the lock icon will be removed because the folder now inherits the permission of the parent folder if that folder does not have any special permissions you will successfully remove the lock from the folder for

a network im assuming the printer has a control panel and neither the router or the printer support wps pairing if they do post back cos that can make it very easy youll need to know the wifi encryption method your router is set to and your wifi password this may not be the exact sequence as the menus on printers vary from make to make but the process seems to be similar across brands press the menu button on the printer and select network select wlan and it should offer a setup wizard or similar from there is should display your network select it encryption type select it youll then need to input your password normally by using the updown and leftright arrows ok it when done and voila hopefully youll be connected then on the mac in system preferences print scan you should be able to add the printer sometimes but not always ive found that ive had to connect the printer via usb cable during the process of setting up then once connect via wifi unplugged it read all 7 posts
