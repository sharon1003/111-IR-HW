in example sc3 we proceeded through all ten of the vector space properties before believing that a subset was a subspace but six of the properties were easy to prove and we can lean on some of the properties of the vector space the superset to make the other four easier here is a theorem that will make it easier to test if a subset is a vector space a shortcut if there ever was one theorem tss testing subsets for subspaces suppose that v is a vector space and w is a subset of v w ⊆ v endow w with the same operations as v then w is a subspace if and only if three conditions are met w is nonempty w ≠ ∅  if x ∈ w and y ∈ w then x  y ∈ w  if α ∈ c and x ∈ w then α x ∈ w  proof so just three conditions plus being a subset of a known vector space gets us all ten properties fabulous this theorem can be paraphrased by saying that a subspace is “a nonempty subset of a vector space that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication”you might want to go back and rework example sc3 in light of this result perhaps seeing where we can now economize or where the work done in the example mirrored the proof and where it did not we will press on and apply this theorem in a slightly more abstract setting example sp4 a subspace of p 4much of the power of theorem tss is that we can easily establish new vector spaces if we can locate them as subsets of other vector spaces such as the vector spaces presented in subsection vs evs it can be as instructive to consider some subsets that are not subspaces since theorem tss is an equivalence see proof technique e we can be assured that a subset is not a subspace if it violates one of the three conditions and in any example of interest this will not be the “nonempty” condition however since a subspace has to be a vector space in its own right we can also search for a violation of any one of the ten defining properties in definition vs or any inherent property of a vector space such as those given by the basic theorems of subsection vs vsp notice also that a violation need only be for a specific vector or pair of vectors example nsc2z a nonsubspace in c 2 zero vector example nsc2a a nonsubspace in c 2 additive closure example nsc2s a nonsubspace in c 2 scalar multiplication closure there are two examples of subspaces that are trivial suppose that v is any vector space then v is a subset of itself and is a vector space by definition s v qualifies as a subspace of itself the set containing just the zero vector z   0  is also a subspace as can be seen by applying theorem tss or by simple modifications of the techniques hinted at in example vss since these subspaces are so obvious and therefore not too interesting we will refer to them as being trivial definition ts trivial subspaces given the vector space v the subspaces v and  0 are each called atrivial subspace we can also use theorem tss to prove more general statements about subspaces as illustrated in the next theorem theorem nsms null space of a matrix is a subspace suppose that a is an m × n matrix then the null space of a n  a is a subspace of c n proof here is an example where we can exercise theorem nsms example rsns recasting a subspace as a null space
