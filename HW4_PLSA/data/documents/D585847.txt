raccoon control information fig 1 the distinctively marked raccoon  procyon lotor with water identification the raccoon procyon lotor also called “coon” is a stocky mammal about 2 to 3 feet 61 to 91 cm long weighing 10 to 30 pounds 45 to 135 kg rarely 40 to 50 pounds 18 to 225 kg it is distinctively marked with a prominent black “mask” over the eyes and a heavily furred ringed tail fig 1 the animal is a grizzled saltandpepper gray and black above although some individuals are strongly washed with yellow raccoons from the prairie areas of the western great plains are paler in color than those from eastern portions of the region fig 2 distribution of the raccoon in north america range the raccoon is found throughout the united states with the exception of the higher elevations of mountainous regions and some areas of the arid southwest fig 2 raccoons are more common in the wooded eastern portions of the united states than in the more arid western plains habitat raccoons prefer hardwood forest areas near water although commonly found in association with water and trees raccoons occur in many areas of the western united states around farmsteads and livestock watering areas far from naturally occurring bodies of permanent water raccoons den in hollow trees ground burrows brush piles muskrat houses barns and abandoned buildings dense clumps of cattail haystacks or rock crevices general biology reproduction and behavior raccoons are omnivorous eating both plant and animal foods plant foods include all types of fruits berries nuts acorns corn and other types of grain animal foods are crayfish clams fish frogs snails insects turtles and their eggs mice rabbits muskrats and the eggs and young of groundnesting birds and waterfowl contrary to popular myth raccoons do not always wash their food before eating although they frequently play with their food in water raccoons breed mainly in february or march but matings may occur from december through june depending on latitude the gestation period is about 63 days most litters are born in april or may but some latebreeding females may not give birth until june july or august only 1 litter of young is raised per year average litter size is 3 to 5 the young first open their eyes at about 3 weeks of age young raccoons are weaned sometime between 2 and 4 months of age raccoons are nocturnal adult males occupy areas of about 3 to 20 square miles 8 to 52 km 2  compared to about 1 to 6 square miles 3 to 16 km 2 for females adult males tend to be territorial and their ranges overlap very little raccoons do not truly hibernate but they do “hole up” in dens and become inactive during severe winter weather in the southern united states they may be inactive for only a day or two at a time whereas in the north this period of inactivity may extend for weeks or months in northern areas raccoons may lose up to half their fall body weight during winter as they utilize stored body fat raccoon populations consist of a high proportion of young animals with onehalf to threefourths of fall populations normally composed of animals less than 1 year in age raccoons may live as long as 12 years in the wild but such animals are extremely rare usually less than half of the females will breed the year after their birth whereas most adult females normally breed every year family groups of raccoons usually remain together for the first year and the young will often den for the winter with the adult female the family gradually separates during the following spring and the young become independent damage and damage identification raccoons may cause damage or nuisance problems in a variety of ways and their distinctive tracks fig 3 often provide evidence of their involvement in damage situations raccoons occasionally kill poultry and leave distinctive signs the heads of adult birds are usually bitten off and left some distance from the body the crop and breast may be torn and chewed the entrails sometimes eaten and bits of flesh left near water young poultry in pens or cages may be killed or injured by raccoons reaching through the wire and attempting to pull the birds back through the mesh legs or feet of the young birds may be missing eggs may be removed completely from nests or eaten on the spot with only the heavily cracked shell remaining the lines of fracture will normally be along the long axis of the egg and the nest materials are often disturbed raccoons can also destroy bird nests in artificial nesting structures such as bluebird and wood duck nest boxes raccoons can cause considerable damage to garden or truck crops particularly sweet corn raccoon damage to sweet corn is characterized by many partially eaten ears with the husks pulled back stalks may also be broken as raccoons climb to get at the ears raccoons damage watermelons by digging a small hole in the melon and then raking out the contents with a front paw raccoons cause damage or nuisance problems around houses and outbuildings when they seek to gain entrance to attics or chimneys or when they raid garbage in search of food in many urban or suburban areas raccoons are learning that uncapped chimneys make very adequate substitutes for more traditional hollow trees for use as denning sites particularly in spring in extreme cases raccoons may tear off shingles or facia boards in order to gain access to an attic or wall space raccoons also can be a considerable nuisance when they roll up freshly laid sod in search of earthworms and grubs they may return repeatedly and roll up extensive areas of sod on successive nights this behavior is particularly common in mid to late summer as young raccoons are learning to forage for themselves and during periods of dry weather when other food sources may be less available the incidence of reported rabies in raccoons and other wildlife has increased dramatically over the past 30 years raccoons have recently been identified as the major wildlife host of rabies in the united states primarily due to increased prevalence in the eastern united states legal status raccoons are protected furbearers in most states with seasons established for running hunting or trapping most states however have provisions for landowners to control furbearers that are damaging their property check with your state wildlife agency before using any lethal controls damage prevention and control methods exclusion exclusion if feasible is usually the best method of coping with raccoon damage fig 6 a cap or exclusion device will keep raccoons and other animals out of chimneys these are available commercially and should be made of heavy material tightly clamp or fasten them to chimneys to prevent raccoons from pulling or tearing them off poultry damage generally can be prevented by excluding the raccoons with tightly covered doors and windows on buildings or meshwire fences with an overhang surrounding poultry yards raccoons are excellent climbers and are capable of gaining access by climbing conventional fences or by using overhanging limbs to bypass the fence a “hot wire” from an electric fence charger at the top of the fence will greatly increase the effectiveness of a fence for excluding raccoons fig 5 wrapping a ripening ear of sweet corn with reinforced filament tape as shown can reduce raccoon damage by 70 to 80 it is important that each loop of the tape be wrapped over itself so that it forms a closed loop that cannot be ripped open by the raccoon damage to sweet corn or watermelons can most effectively be stopped by excluding raccoons with a single or double hotwire arrangement fig 4 the fence should be turned on in the evening before dusk and turned off after daybreak electric fences should be used with care and appropriate caution signs installed wrapping filament tape around ripening ears of corn fig 5 or placing plastic bags over the ears is an effective method of reducing raccoon damage to sweet corn in general tape or fencing is more effective than bagging when using tape it is important to apply the type with glassyarn filaments embedded within so that the raccoons cannot tear through the tape taping is more laborintensive than fencing but may be more practical and acceptable for small backyard gardens store garbage in metal or tough plastic containers with tightfitting lids to discourage raccoons from raiding garbage cans if lids do not fit tightly it may be necessary to wire weight or clamp them down to prevent raccoons from lifting the lid to get at garbage secure cans to a rack or tie them to a support to prevent raccoons from tipping them over prevent raccoon access to chimneys by securely fastening a commercial cap of sheet metal and heavy screen over the top of the chimney fig 6 raccoon access to rooftops can be limited by removing overhanging branches and by wrapping and nailing sheets of slick metal at least 3 feet 90 cm square around corners of buildings this prevents raccoons from being able to get a toehold for climbing fig 7 while this method may be practical for outbuildings it is unsightly and generally unacceptable for homes it is more practical to cover chimneys or other areas attracting raccoons to the rooftop or to remove the offending individual animals than to completely exclude them from the roof homeowners attempting to exclude or remove raccoons in the spring and summer should be aware of the possibility that young may also be present do not complete exclusion procedures until you are certain that all raccoons have been removed from or have left the exclusion area raccoons frequently will use uncapped chimneys as natal den sites raising the young on the smoke shelf or the top of the fireplace box until weaning homeowners with the patience to wait out several weeks of scratching rustling and chirring sounds will normally be rewarded by the mother raccoon moving the young from the chimney at the time she begins to wean them homeowners with less patience can often contact a pest removal or chimney sweep service to physically remove the raccoons in either case raccoon exclusion procedures should be completed immediately after the animals have left or been removed habitat modification there are no practical means of modifying habitat to reduce raccoon depredations other than removing any obvious sources of food or shelter which may be attracting the raccoons to the premises raccoons forage over wide areas and anything other than local habitat modification to reduce raccoon numbers is not a desirable technique for reducing damage raccoons sometimes will roll up freshly laid sod in search of worms or grubs if sodded areas are not extensive it may be possible to pin the rolls down with long wire pins wooden stakes or nylon netting until the grass can take root especially if the damage is restricted to only a portion of the yard such as a shaded area where the grass is slower to take root in more rural areas use of electric fences may be effective see section on exclusion because the sodturning behavior is most prevalent in midto late summer when family groups of raccoons are learning to forage homeowners may be able to avoid problems by having the sod installed in spring or early summer in most cases however removal of the problem raccoons is usually necessary frightening although several techniques have been used to frighten away raccoons particularly in sweet corn patches none has been proven to be effective over a long period of time these techniques have included the use of lights radios dogs scarecrows plastic or cloth streamers aluminum pie pans tin can lids and plastic windmills all of these may have some temporary effectiveness in deterring raccoons but none will provide adequate longterm protection in most situations repellents toxicants and fumigants there are no repellents toxicants or fumigants currently registered for raccoon control trapping raccoons are relatively easy to catch in traps but it takes a sturdy trap to hold one for homeowners with pets a live or cagetype trap fig 8 is usually the preferable alternative to a leghold trap traps should be at least 10 x 12 x 32 inches 254 x 305 x 813 cm and wellconstructed with heavy materials they can be baited with canned fishflavored cat food sardines fish or chicken place a pile of bait behind the treadle and scatter a few small bits of bait outside the opening of the trap and just inside the entrance traps with a single door should be placed with the back against a wall tree or other object the back portion of the trap should be tightly screened with onehalf inch 13 cm or smaller mesh wire to prevent raccoons from reaching through the wire to pull out the bait conibear®type bodygripping traps are effective for raccoons and can be used in natural or artificial cubbies or boxes because these traps do not allow for selective release of nontarget catches they should not be used in areas where risk of nontarget capture is high box or leghold traps should be used in those situations instead it is possible however to use bodygripping traps in boxes or on leaning poles so that they are inaccessible to dogs figs 9 and 10 check local state laws for restrictions regarding use of conibear®type traps out of water raccoons also can be captured in foothold traps use a no 1 or no 1 12 coilspring or stoploss trap fastened to a drag such as a tree limb 6 to 8 feet 18 to 24 m long for water sets use a drowning wire that leads to deep water the dp trap and egg trap are new footholding devices that are highly selective dogproof and show promise for reducing traprelated injury they are available from trapping supply outlets fig 8 a cagetype live trap although bulky and expensive is often the best choice for removing raccoons near houses or buildings where there is a likelihood of capturing dogs or cats fig 9 a “raccoon box” is suspended 6 inches above the ground and is equipped with a conibear®type trap suspended at this level this set is dogproof the “pocket set” is very effective for raccoons and is made along the water’s edge where at least a slight bank is present fig 11 dig a hole 3 to 6 inches 76 to 152 cm in diameter horizontally back into the bank at least 10 to 12 inches 254 to 305 cm the bottom 2 inches 51 cm of the hole should be below the water level place a bait or lure fish frog anise oil honey in the back of the hole above the water level set the trap a no 1 or 1 12 coilspring doublejaw or stoploss is recommended below the water level in front of or just inside the opening the trap should be tied to a movable drag or attached with a oneway slide to a drowning wire leading to deep water dirthole sets fig 12 are effective for raccoons place a bait or lure in a small hole and conceal the trap under a light covering of soil in front of the hole a no 1 or 1 12 coilspring trap is recommended for this set it is important to use a small piece of clean cloth light plastic or a wad of dry grass to prevent soil from getting under the round pan of the trap and keeping it from going down if this precaution is not taken the trap may not go off shooting raccoons are seldom seen during the day because of their nocturnal habits shooting raccoons can be effective at night with proper lighting trained dogs can be used to tree the raccoons first a 22caliber rifle will effectively kill treed raccoons many states have restrictions on the use of artificial light to spot and shoot raccoons at night and shooting is prohibited in most towns and cities it is advisable to check with state and local authorities before using any lethal controls for raccoons economics of damage and control statistics are unavailable on the amount of economic damage caused by raccoons but the damage may be offset by their positive economic and aesthetic values in 1982 to 1983 raccoons were by far the most valuable furbearer to hunters and trappers in the united states an estimated 48 million raccoons worth 88 million were harvested raccoons also provide recreation for hunters trappers and people who enjoy watching them although raccoon damage and nuisance problems can be locally severe widespread raccoon control programs authorities before using any lethal conare not justifiable except perhaps to prevent the spread of raccoon rabies from a costbenefit and ecological standpoint prevention practices and specific control of problem individuals or localized populations are the most desirable alternatives acknowledgments although information
