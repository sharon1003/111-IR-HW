chemistry inorganic chemistry molecular structure electronic configuration aufbau principle aufbau principle antoine lavoisier discovered that an element as a basic substance could not be further broken down into 1789 further in 1805 john dalton proposed that each element consists of atoms of a single unique type many scientists contributed in revealing the presence of charged particles in an atom the atom is a basic unit of matter that consists of a nucleus at the centre surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged particles known as electrons the atomic nucleus contains positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons if we follow the rutherford’s model the matter would not exist in the form that we know according to the physics of that time the planetary model of an atom should have an extremely short lifetime but it‘s not like this we know that matter is stable and there should be some correction in his model in order to find out those corrections neils bohr put forward the some postulates about the model of an atom in the knowledge of the emission spectrum of hydrogen the distribution of electrons in an atom can be represented with the help of electronic configuration that is a sequence of atomic orbitals according to increasing order of their energy there are some rules which are used to assign the position of electrons in atomic orbitals let’s discuss aufbau rule for writing the electronic configuration of atom aufbau principle definitionaccording to aufbau principle as protons are added to the nucleus the electrons are successively added to orbitals of increasing energy beginning with the lowest energy orbitals and continue doing so until all electrons are accommodated electronic configuration back to top according to the increasing order of orbital energy the following order is observed 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p 6s 4f 5d 6p 7s it is very important to remember that the energy level sequence follows up to orbital 3p and thereafter orbital 4s comes instead of orbital 3d in fact the orbital energy basically is ascertained by the quantum numbers n and l alongwith the help of an bohr burys rule n  l according to thisneutral atoms exhibiting lower energy have the lower orbital value of n  l compared to the orbital with higher n l value orbitals having same n  l would show lower energy only when the orbital has lower n value for example 3sorbital n  l  3  0  3 possesses lower energy than 3p n  l  3  1  4 orbital for instance the 2porbital would show n  l  2  1  3 while the 3sorbital would give us n  l  3  0  3 now as we can see both have the same n  l value but since 2porbital has n value lower than the other therefore it will have lower energy  rule ii this aufbau rule helps us to identify the orbitals with higher n value but lower l value having lesser energy than the orbitals with lower n value with higher l value for instance let us consider 4s and 3dorbitals in 3dorbital n  l the value  3  2  5 in 4sorbital n  l the value  4  0  4 therefore 4sorbital has lower energy compared to 3dorbital the energy level sequence could be easily recalled with a systematic diagram as given below from the figure the following sequence is observed for orbitals in the increasing energy 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p 6s 4f 5d 6p 7s the complete electronic configuration of an atom can be written bydetermine the total number of electrons present in an atom from the respective atomic number fill electrons in correct order to the sublevels for writing the electronic configuration we must know about quantum numbers shells sub shells and orbitals the principal quantum number “n” can take on the values 1 2 3 4 5 6   which is associated with principle energy level these energy levels are known as shell hence shell 1 has n1 shell 2 has n2 etc and so on each shell has certain number of sub shells each sub shell is associated with one or more number of orbitals principle quantum number number of sub shells the sub shells labels1 1 s2 2 s p3 3 s p d4 4 s p d f remember that you can fill maximum two electrons in each orbital hence 2 electrons in s sub level 6 to each p sub level 10 to each d sub level and 14 to each f sub level now there must be some rule to direct the filling of electron in different sub level to get correct electronic configuration aufbau principle is the guideline for writing the correct electronic configuration of elements→ read more aufbau rule back to top aufbau rule is a set of rules for writing the electronic configuration first lower energy orbitals occupy with electrons then higher energy ones if an empty lower energy orbital is present electron cannot move to higher energy orbital the energy of various orbitals is given below 1s  2s  2p  3s  3p  4s  4p  5s  4d  5p  6s  4f  5d  6p  7s  5f  6d  7p  8s  it’s difficult to memorize correct order of energy level so it’s better to use the memory aid shown below to remind correct order of filling sub levels for writing the correct order first write the possible sub levels for each energy level in organized rows and columns remember that every principal energy level has an s orbital while second principal energy and all higher energy levels have a p sub level the d sub levels start on the third principal energy level the f sub levels start on the fourth principal energy level etc start from the top arrow follow the arrows one by one in the given direction and write the sub levels as you pass through them the other rule is pauli exclusion principle given by austrian physicist wolfgang pauli in 1925 states that no two electrons can have same quantum number for example if n l and m are the same and the spin quantum number must be different such that the electrons have opposite spins in other words only two electrons can be accommodated in one orbital because they have opposite spin 12  12 respectively hund rule of maximum multiplicity which is given by german physicist friedrich hund in 1927 states that if two or more orbitals of equal energy are available electrons will occupy them individually before filling them in pairs for example in electronic configuration of carbon atomic number6  the valence electron fill in next orbital of 2p instead of pairing with previous electron hence electronic configuration must be 1s 2 2s 2  2p x 1 2p y 1  and 1s 2  2s 2  2px 2 is incorrect in electronic configuration electrons are always filled in order of increasing n1 for the same value of n1 the orbital with the lower n has to fill first here n is the principal quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number for example in sulfur atomic number 16 the last electron will fill in 3p not in 4s the nl value for 3p and 4s is 4 but the n value for 3p is 3 but for 4s it is 4 hence valence electron will fill in 3p not in 4s atom always want to make such type of electronic configuration in which there are maximum number of half filled and full filled orbitals such type of orbitals are stable becausein full filled and half filled orbital electrons are distributed symmetrically there is a possibility of transition between electrons in equal energy orbitals this transition releases some amount of energy which stabilizes the system the coupling of oppositely spin electrons provides stability to system for example the valance electron in copper atomic number 29 must fill in 4s orbital with 3d 9 4s 2 valance electronic configuration but for getting stable configuration one electron transfer from 4s to 3d and form 3d 10 4s 2 valence shell configuration which is stable due to fulfilled 3d and 4s orbitals hyperconjugation valence electrons periodic table related topics chemistry help chemistry tutor
