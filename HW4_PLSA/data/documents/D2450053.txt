what definitionthe simple idea that electron groups which we define as lone pairs single bonds multiple bonds and even single electrons repel one another through coulombic forces repulsions between electron groups determine molecuular geometry termwhich occupies more space a bonding pair or a nonbonding pair of electrons definitiona nonbonding pair termtetrahedral geometry is like how many balloons tied together definitionfour balloons termfive electron groups around a central atom assume a  bipyramidal geometry definitiontrigonal termsix electron groups around a central atom assume a  geometry like that of  balloons together definitionoctahedral geometry six balloons termin a five electron group with lone pairs is the axial or the equatorial position more favorable for lone pair electrons why definitionthe equatorial position because it has only 2 90 degree interactions with bonding pairs termwhat 5 things count as a single electron group definitiona lone pair a single bond a double bond a triple bond or a single electron termall   on the central atom determine the shape of a molecule according to the vsepr theory definitionelectron groups termwhat degree do three bonding pairs have between them definition120 degree termhow many degrees between hydrogen would ch4 assume since it has no lone pairs definition1095term lone pair s is  to 107 degrees in nh3definitionone

groups what are the angles definitiona trigonal bypyramid one on top one on bottom three around axis 90 degrees from the top or bottom to the axial groups and 120 degrees for in between the axial groups termwhat does tetrahedral geometry look like how many electron groups is this definitiona molecule with four or more electron groups would have tetrahedral geometry there is one group at the top of the central atom and three groups that are at 1095 degree angles around the axis in the lower portion termwhat kind of geometry would six electron groups make what would it look like what is the degree in between all of the balloons definitionoctahedral geometry it would have one group on top one on bottom and four around the central axis 90 degrees term vsepr stands for definitionvalence shell electron pair repulsion termtwo lone pairs in h20 would be what degree for the actual molecular geometry definition1045 degree termin sf4 it creates what molecular geometry because of the equatorial lone pair it has 5 electron groupsdefinitionseesaw termin br f3 two of the five electron groups around the central atom are lone pairs what positions would the lone pairs occupy and why what is the electron geometry of this structure and what is the molecular geometry definitionthey are in the equatorial positions this minimizes 90 degree interactions the electron geometry is trigonal bipyramidal and the molecular geometry is tshaped termin br f5 there are six electron groups because of a lone pair what is the electron geometry and the molecular geometry definitionthe electron geometry is octahedral and the molecular geometry is square pyramidal termwhen two of the six electron groups around the central atom are lone pairs what positions do the lone pairs occupy what is the electron  molecular geometry definitionthe occupy the axial positions electron geometry is octahedral and molecular geometry is square planar termthree electron groups around a central atom is what electron  molecular geometries definitiontrigonal planar trigonal planar termis a molecule polar or nonpolar if 2 polar bonds are bent definitionpolar you iextend a vector between them termis a molecule nonpolar or polar if it has three identical polar bonds at 120 degrees from each other definitionnon nonpolar termif the dipole moments of four identical polar bonds in a tetrahedral arrangement cancel is it polar or nonpolar definitionnonpolar termthe dipole moments of three polar bonds in a trigonal pyramidal arrangement 1095 degrees from eachother will cancel or not cancel therefore it is polar or nonpolar definitionthey will not cancel and result in a dipole moment vector it is polar termdipole moment definitiona measure of the separation of positive and negative charge in a molecule termelectronegativity definitionthe ability of an atom to attract electrons to itself in a covalent bondtermenthalpy definitionthe sum of the internal energy of a system and the product of its pressure and volume the energy associated with the breaking and forming of bonds in a chemical reaction termarrange the electron group repulsions from order of greatest to smallest

polar definition1 draw a lewis structure for the molecule and determine the molecular geometry 2 determine whether the molecule contains polar bonds 3 determine whether the polar bonds add together to form a net dipole moment termwhy do oil and water not mix definitionwater is polar so its molecules interact strongly with one another and clump together termis oh polar or nonpolar will it attract water definition oh is polar and yes termvalence bond theory definitionan advanced model of chemical bonding in which electrons reside in quantummechanical orbitals localized on individual atoms that are a hybridized blend of standard atomic orbitals chemical bonds result from an overlap of these orbitals termthe interaction energy is usually  or stablizing when the interacting atomic orbitals contain a total of two electrons that can spinpair what theory does this come from definitionnegative energy valence bond theory terma chemical bond result from the overlap of what what kind of pairing do they do what is the less common kind of overlap definitiona chemical bond result from the overlap of two half filled orbitals with spin pairing of the two valence electrons or less commonly
