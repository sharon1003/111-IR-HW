acrylic epoxy or polyester resins and pigments it is most frequently used for seamless countertop installations solid surface top seamless integral kitchen sink integral cove slash with wall panel solid surface was first introduced by du pont in 1967 under the name of corian since the expiration of their patent other manufacturers have also introduced their brands as well contents  hide 1

nonporous lowmaintenance material used for surfaces such as countertops it can mimic the appearance of granite marble stone and other naturally occurring materials and can be joined nearly invisibly by a trained craftsman typically manufactured in sheet form for fabrication into finished countertops solid surface can also be cast into a variety of shapes including sinks shower pans and bathtubs sheet goods can also be heated and bent into threedimensional shapes using a process called thermoforming which adds to the versatility of the product color and design flexibility are key factors when choosing engineered composites over natural stone in a residential setting solid surface can be used as kitchen countertops bathroom vanity tops and shower and tub surrounds countertop fabricators typically join solid surface sheets into desired shapes using a twopart adhesive after which the cured joint is machined flat the same method is used to build up edge thickness which can be profiled using tools and techniques similar to those used to work hardwoods a major appeal of solid surface is its impermeability solid surface sinks can be joined to the countertop surface with no gaps which eliminates areas for water to collect and bacteria to grow integral backsplashes can also be created that follow the contours of the wall “seamlessly” and without gaps should the material become scratched or broken solid surface can in most cases be repaired quickly by a certified solid surface repair company or trained fabricator cracked sinks can be replaced as well because the surface is solid throughout a countertop that has undergone years of wear and tear can be refinished the installed product is available in a variety of finishes ranging from matte to highgloss although most manufacturers recommend a matte or satin finish for ease of maintenance availability  editsolid surface is available in hundreds of colors and visual textures ranging from solid colors to sparkling marbleized or granite effect dozens of multinational companies manufacture solid surface sheet goods and sinks for the world market and hundreds of smaller regional manufacturers produce for local markets although solid surface faces competition from natural stone and engineered stonequartz surfacing the material is popular in asia particularly in residential new construction an emerging market for solid surface is in commercial and industrial settings where its nonporous characteristics combined with durability renewability and formability make it the material of choice for many designers and architects also appealing is the wide range of colors and textures as well as the ability to customcolor the material for large projects hospitals in particular employ large amounts of solid surface for sinks showers nursing stations and wall cladding because its seamless properties eliminate gaps and crevices that harbor harmful bacteria manufacture  editsolid surface is manufactured by mixing acrylic epoxide or polyester resin with powdered bauxite filler and pigments the material chemically cures and is heated to 60°c or more cured material is then cut in sheets or shapes and sanded on one or both sides depending the brand used sometimes the material is brought to 160°c and cooled to improve its heat resistance acrylicmodified polyester solid surface can be mixed one sheet at a time using different formulations effects and appearances acrylicmodified polyester solid surface can be injected into molds to produce various solid decorative design figures solidsurface manufacturing companies may be members of the trade organizations american composites manufacturers association isfa international surface fabricators association and icpa international cast polymer association 1 these organizations identify the product under the brand of master cast engineered composites fabrication  edita surface fabricator shapes and installs functional and decorative surfaces usually in buildings surface fabrication as a distinct professional enterprise usually involves complex tasks of surface shaping a leading case is countertop fabrication materials  editfor interior spaces surfaces include solid coverings or decking for floors or walls and countertops for kitchens bathrooms and workspaces natural surfaces are composed of naturally occurring materials like wood stone mineral clay gum and resin synthetic surfaces contain in addition to any natural materials manmade substances such as metal alloys or polymers solid surfaces are synthetic surfaces manufactured from polymeric materials tools  edittools of surface fabrication include routers drills templates clamps ovens suction cup grips and table saws larger surface fabricators may also use cnc routers for all but the simplest jobs surface fabrication usually takes place in the workshop after which the finished product is assembled and installed at the work site installation of multipart surfaces such as l and u shaped countertops often involves complex work with specialized tools to create a seamless result applications  editsolid surfaces is used in the following environment kitchenbathroom

public buildings displays in museums facades meeting tables etc hospitals laboratory countertops decontamination sinks endoscopy etc solid surface is priced to compete with natural stone or quartz surfacing it is available in many colors and patterns the material can be formed to shape which makes it appealing to commercial and industrial designers specialist fabricators possess the skills and knowledge necessary to provide advice and customer service certain highheat applications anything above 400 f 200 c are discouraged due to the danger of cracking because scratches in solid surface appear white to the human eye most dark colors are not recommended for high use areas related materials  editengineered stone uses quartz powder and pigments and generally requires different tools
