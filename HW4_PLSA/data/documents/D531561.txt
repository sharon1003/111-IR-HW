oreos or mrs fields’ white chocolate macadamia nut cookies on this diet no you’re going to be eating the concoctions of dr siegal a physician who specializes in hypothyroidism and obesity and who also likes to sell weight loss books and snacks however his proprietary hungercontrolling cookies are a dietdeceiving indulgence they look like bricks of fibercoated oats sweetened with prunes although they may make you less hungry the doctor also advises combining them with a restricted calorie diet which as we all know is the main way you’re going to lose weight i also like how he has trademarked the term “let’s face it hunger wrecks diets” uh so do cookies10 the subway diet ever since i worked in a building where the women’s restroom abutted a subway sandwich shop i have had an almost pavlovian reaction to thought of eating one of their subs it reminds me of the toilet and makes me want to gag so although i know many people like subway eating them twice a day for a year like the guy on the subway commercials who lost 245 pounds seems inconceivable and it seems like i could save a whole lot of money by just making my own sandwiches and maybe going for a jog now and again9 the cereal diet this is similar to the subway diet in that you’re supposed to supplant two meals a day with the same thing—in this case cereal from special k to raisin bran many cereal boxes now claim you can “lose six in two”— that is lose six pounds in two weeks of course the premise is the same when people have to measure the amount they are eating they end up eating fewer calories so they lose weight and it’s not like these cereals are health food or anything the third ingredient in special k is sugar it’s the second ingredient in allbran and the last thing you want to be eating too much of is allbran—it’s not weight you’d lose but the contents of your bowels8 cabbage soup diet mmmm … cabbage good on st patrick’s day not so good every day unless you’re trying to lose up to ten pounds in a single week then maybe cabbage doesn’t sound so bad anymore but being light headed weak and suffering from decreased concentration as some diet participants have reported does not to mention the inordinate amount of flatulence you are bound to have on a cabbage laden diet slim but stinky7 slim fast first a subway sandwich then cereal now a slim fast shake or food item the basic premise is the same replace two meals with any of the above you lose weight and the maker of said item makes a lot of money that is until you grow so bored and tired of eating the exact same thing for two meals a day you quit and realize that—wow—there are a lot of other foods out there that cost a lot less say fruits and vegetables6 blood type diet according to this diet different blood types should eat different foods if you’re group o you’re a hunter and should eat meat if you’re a you’re a cultivator and are best as a vegetarian b a nomad eat dairy the rare ab blood type should eat—you guessed it—a combination of the foods recommended for groups a and b if this sounds more like the plot of a bad high school play than a diet that’s because there’s really no evidence that your blood type has any influence on your weight or overall health look past the a’s b’s and o’s and you’ll see this a fad diet that doesn’t make much sense5 russian air force diet this diet does not require you to stand in the bread line but it does require you to survive on near starvation levels of food originally developed in the former soviet union to keep soldiers fit you are allowed to put herbs salt pepper vinegar worcestershire sauce mustard and ketchup on all your meals but about those meals … breakfast is coffee only lunch two eggs a tomato and dinner allows you to feast on a sliver of meat and a salad yes you will lose weight yes you will feel like you’ve enlisted and yes you will feel like you are back in the ussr4 the threeday diethot dog diet these diets are similar because both recommend eating franks for dinner you also get to eat one cup of vanilla ice cream and one tablespoon of peanut butter in the course of this diet as well as other strictly measured amounts of food the result of losing ten pounds over the course of three days is due to severe calorie restriction even if your calories are coming from precisely measured hotdogs and after the three days regain3 the apple cider vinegar diet yummy—nothing like throwing back a few teaspoons of vinegar to get your gut prepared for a meal talk about an appetite suppressant this diet relies on the premise that apple cider vinegar taken fifteen minutes before a meal will decrease hunger and curb the urge to nibble shrug it wont hurt however there’s no real evidence that apple cider vinegar can actually help you lose weight but you know what will reducing portions and exercising like most of the proponents of this fad also tell you to do will2 the writing diet i can’t seem to figure out why we writers aren’t all size twos because according to julia cameron’s book the writing diet write yourself rightsized we should be the premise for this toogoodtobetrue diet is that people overeat not out of hunger but because of emotion by writing daily we tap into our emotions and put them on the page instead of in our mouths while i can concede that having your hands on a keyboard will prevent them from grabbing a bag of doritos i can’t figure out how sitting on your butt is supposed to make it smaller and the number one most ridiculous diet …1 the cotton ball diet nope that’s not a typo believe it or not this is a thing it apparently was started by some starving emaciated models to help them curb their appetite so they didn’t eat more than a couple of carrot sticks a day unfortunately it appears to have caught on like wildfire among young girls longing to be supermodel thin here’s how this ridiculous “diet” is supposed to work and the for love of all that is good in this world do not try this at home these misguided young women take a cotton ball give it a quick dunk into a liquid like orange juice and swallow it a couple of those in your tummy supposedly fools your body into thinking it’s full the result you lose weight  oh and possibly die because let’s face it this isn’t really a diet it’s a recipe for disaster and possibly death1 tweet share pin stumble bio latest posts healthier
