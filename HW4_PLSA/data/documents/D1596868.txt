was revealed to be infertile in season sevens symphony of illumination the mother being dead by the time ted tells their life story was an extremely popular theory when the series aired especially due to future teds increasingly serious tone as the seasons continue past candidates this is a list of people who in the past were potential candidates for being the mother however due to new information released later during the series these people have been excluded from being potential candidates please note that only those who had a realistic chance of being the mother are included in this list such as those that have been in serious longterm relationships with ted teds love solutions match during matchmaker ted has a date with teds love solutions match as they share a lot of similar interests and she wants the same things out of life as ted does however ted realizes that he doesnt want perfect he wants robin and stands her up on their date to pursue robin instead ted says shes 28 but tracy turned 21 during the events of the pilot so it is very unlikely they are the same person coincidentally tracy was 28 years old when she met ted robin scherbatsky in the pilot it was shown that ted wanted to get married and loved robin so it was implied that she would be the mother however at the end of the episode future ted reveals that that girl turned out to be aunt robin not the mother in symphony of illumination it is revealed that robin cannot have children so she could not be the mother lastly in the magicians code  part two it is shown that robin is the bride at barneys wedding eliminating any possibilities of her being the mother relationship with robin so far every step that has brought ted closer to meeting the mother has been indirectly connected to robin in some way in season 1 teds attraction to robin prevented him from having a longterm relationship with several women most notably victoria  nothing good happens after 2 a min season 2 robin and ted began dating taking ted off the market for awhile in season 3 robin and ted have split up causing ted to rebound get a tattoo and then have it removed by his dermatologist and later girlfriend and fiancée

into stella and tony who offers ted a teaching position at a local college which he accepts which leads him to meeting cindy the mothers roommate  right place right time as fast as she can  the leap  girls versus suitsin season 6 robin encourages ted to break up with zoey knowing that the arcadian s fate would kill their relationship regardless of what happened  landmarksin season 7 ted cancels his deal with robin to get married at 40 saying that it is holding him back teds obsession with robin also prevents him from seeing other women robin is revealed to be the bride at the wedding where ted meets the mother  no pressure the magicians code  part two in season 8 when ted proposes to victoria a few months after they got back together she makes him decide between marrying her or keeping his friendship with robin ted chooses his friendship with robin and as a result ted and victoria break up  the autumn of breakupsa chance meeting with cindy leads ted to hire the mothers band for barney and robins wedding  band or dj after barney and robins wedding reception ted is at the farhampton train station because he plans on moving to chicago to not be around robin and barney after they get married and meets the mother at the train station  farhampton something new in season 9 barney reveals that robin dared him to pick up a woman who was later revealed to be the mother the mother figured out he was in love with robin and encouraged him to propose to her if robin didnt dare barney in the first place they would never have gotten married and ted may still be alone  platonishin the end of the aisle just as robin tried to run off on her wedding she bumps into the mother as the latter was setting up on the stage robin admitted to the mother her doubts about pushing through with marrying barney the mother then advises robin that taking three deep breaths before making a decision could change everything robin follows it and upon opening her eyes she sees barney who talks about his vow to her and they share a kiss if robin didnt physically bump into the mother the former would have continued running off thus jeopardising the wedding and teds chances of meeting the latter in last forever  part two robin lists teds relationship with tracy as one of the reasons she doesnt hang out with the gang anymore robin reunites with the gang for ted and tracys wedding at tracys encouragement teds kids comment on how the story about how he met tracy focused more on his feelings for robin they conclude that after all these years their father subconsciously still has feelings for robin and they reveal they have noticed romantic tension still existing between them with his childrens blessing he decides to pursue robin again victoria due to the seriousness of their relationship it was suspected victoria would be the mother but as was said earlier in lucky penny future ted states that he had not yet met the mother since ted met victoria months prior to this episode its clear victoria is not the mother victoria leaves her fiancée at the altar for ted and they started dating again in season 8 2 however due to his continued friendship with robin they break up again its likely that if how i met your mother had not been renewed for a second season victoria would have been a fallback option and become the mother stella zinman stella was a likely candidate to be the mother due to the seriousness of her relationship with ted culminating with their engagement and subsequent wedding plans in ten sessions stella tells ted that the last party shed been to was on st patricks day whereas in the previous episode no tomorrow he reveals to his kids that their mother was at a same party that he was on st patricks day however stella left him on their wedding day to be with her exboyfriend and father of her daughter tony grafanello once again if how i met your mother had ended after season 3 stella would likely have been a fallback option similar to victoria and she would have been the mother although stellas daughter lucy not being present while ted is talking to his kids was an early indication stella was not the mother since lucy would have been in her early 30s in 2030 in a hypothetical flash forward ted pictures his kids with stella as being blonde haired zoey pierson zoey was never a possibility to be the mother since it had been stated before ted met her that the day he met his wife was the day of a wedding further down the road zoey is further confirmed as not the mother when ted reveals to wendy the waitress when they cross paths in 2021 that his and zoeys relationship ended badly and that hes since married and had children carly whittaker until ring up it was speculated that the mother could be barney s halfsister carly as this would have literally made robin and barney aunt and uncle to teds future children not much was known about her except that she was currently attending college mentioned by barneys father jerome whittaker in legendaddy thus she may have been in the economics class ted accidentally went into as his first first day as a professor carlys family also lived ten minutes away from teds house ted meets carly in season 8 and briefly dates her without knowing shes barneys sister episode appearances note any episode prior to something new the mother was played by stunt actresses her first official appearance is in the aforementioned episode lucky penny wait for it no tomorrow girls versus suits no pressure farhampton band or dj the time travelers something new first full appearance  series regular after this episodethe locket coming back the lighthouse platonish bass player wanted unpause how your mother met me rally vesuvius gary blauman the end of the aisle last forever  part one last forever  part two notes and trivia the name tracy literally means domain belonging to thrace tracys name came from an english surname derived from the name of a norman french baron and this through a place name meaning domain belonging to thracius thracius is latin and means from thrace where thrace was a region located in southwestern europe currently divided between greece turkey and bulgaria like barney and robin she doesnt age in any of her future appearances this may be due to her death leading ted to have an idealised view of her in his mind and his distance from robin and barney after they marry she graduated with an economics degree from columbia university in 2012 in all of her future appearances except for rally gary blauman and last forever she is at the farhampton inn in rally she is first seen in the back of a limo with ted and again with him at their house on new years day in gary blauman she is on her first date with ted in new york the flashforward of rally

2020 to take a photo of ted with all his friends including robin who she personally encouraged to attend despite robin initially declining the last 20 seconds of the song on tedmosbyisajerkcom sounds like gibberish but if played backwards it plays  wendy the waitress is the mother of the goat carter bays joked that nora was the mother before her appearance in something new  the mother has been played by a variety of stunt actresses including jennifer birmingham and pamela fryman 3 4on the season six dvd set there is a special feature called what we know about your mother in it future ted

wouldnt have had much luck with an orchid id have given her lilacs her favoritewhich just just happened to be the first flower i ever gave herthe very moment we met this did not actually occur ted and the mother met at the train station after barney and robins wedding and bonded over their shared experience with the yellow umbrella josh radnor stated he wanted the mother to be played by an unknown actress “i don’t think it should be any sort of stunt casting i think it would be more interesting to have this fresh exciting face that ted has never seen before and neither have people who watch the show” 5when future ted was imagining what his kids would look like if he married stella they had blond hair the mother has brown hair in all episodes involving flashforwards to barney and robins wedding ted is seen wearing a lilac boutonniere on the suit he wears to the wedding a lilac is the flower he gives to the mother the very moment they meet according to the season 6 dvd set special

response to the question do you have any hunches on who the mother is  she says there was a time when we were told who it was and to never give the information out 6however cristin milioti was cast in the spring of 2013 it is possible lyndsy meant the person ted ends up with was robin due to the fact she and david had already filmed their part in the series finale 6 years prior tracy met all of teds friends prior to barney and robins wedding and met robin mere minutes before the ceremony all his friends were helped by tracy in some form barney is the first to meet tracy in platonish she sees
