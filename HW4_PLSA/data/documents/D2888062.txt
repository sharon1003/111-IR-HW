alcohol as disinfectantsalcohols are effective disinfectants for many reasons they evaporate quickly without leaving a residue they are capable of dissolving lipids which makes them effective against lipidwrapped viral cells such as hiv and hepatitis a they are inexpensive and relatively easy to handle although their vapors are flammable ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are both members of the alcohol family and have similar disinfectant properties ethanol is the type of alcohol present in alcoholic beverages isopropyl alcohol is also known as isopropanol 2propanol or rubbing alcohol when used as disinfectants both are typically at a concentration of 70 percent in water ethanolethanol also known as pure grain alcohol ethyl alcohol or drinking alcohol is one of the most widely used recreational substances it is present in alcoholic beverages and has been consumed since ancient times as a disinfectant it works by denaturing proteins and dissolving lipids effectively destroying many types of bacterial and viral cells it is ineffective against spores ethanol is typically used in concentrations of 70 percent because higher concentrations evaporate too quickly and lower concentrations arent as effective isopropyl alcoholisopropyl alcohol often called ipa or isopropanol is similar in function and structure to ethanol it evaporates at a similar rate and destroys bacterial and viral cells by the same mechanism however it is not as effective at dehydrating living tissue and so is a better solution for disinfecting skin than ethanol differencesethanols chemical formula is c2h5oh isopropyl alcohol is c3h8o both can be produced by fermentation although the fermenting agent for isopropyl alcohol is a bacterium rather than a yeast isopropanol is converted into acetone in the liver which makes it extremely toxic whereas ethanol has no lasting shortterm toxic effects ethanol dehydrates cells more readily conclusionfor disinfecting surfaces ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are nearly equally efficient ethanol may be used in purely surfacecleaning applications but isopropyl alcohol can also double as antiseptic and is often used in hospitals both are most effective at 70 percent concentration and can be used to clean small tools if they are immersed for about 10 minutes both evaporate quickly without leaving a residue and are effective for cleaning optic drives and computer components as of the date of preparation of this document the foregoing information is believed to be accurate and is provided in good faith however no warranty or representation with respect to such information is intended or given
