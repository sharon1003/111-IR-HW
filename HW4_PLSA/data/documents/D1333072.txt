edit article how to cook breakfast sausage five methods panfried boiled and fried baked broiled reheated community qabreakfast sausages are available as links patties or rolls and can be cooked in a variety of ways while the instructions for each cooking process remain the same from form to form exact cooking times may vary slightly ingredients makes 4 to 6 servings12 breakfast sausage links or 6 breakfast sausage patties or 16oz 450g breakfast sausage roll sliced14 cup 60 ml water boiled method onlymethod1 panfried1 heat a nonstick skillet place a medium nonstick skillet on the stove over mediumlow heat let it warm up for 1 or 2 minutes note that you should not add any extra oil or fat to the pan the fat inside the sausage should render as it cooks providing all the grease needed for the frying process if you can check the temperature of the skillet note that the temperature should reach 350 degrees fahrenheit 180 degrees celsius before you continue2 add the sausage arrange the sausage links or patties in the hot skillet keep the sausage in a single layer you can cook both links and patties using this method the cooking times vary slightly but otherwise the process remains the same you can also cook breakfast roll sausage using this method if you slice the sausage roll into 12 inch 125 cm patties beforehand 1 treat these patties as you would treat preformed breakfast patties3 panfry until cooked through cook sausage links for 12 to 16 minutes 2 cook sausage patties for 10 to 12 minutes 3regardless of which form you choose youll need to turn the sausage frequently as it cooks to promote even browning on all sides add an additional 2 minutes if you use frozen breakfast sausage instead of thawed sausage the sausages should be browned all the way through and the internal temperature should read a minimum of 160 degrees fahrenheit 70 degrees celsius4 drain and serve remove the sausage from the hot skillet and transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels drain off the excess grease for 1 or 2 minutes then serve the sausage while its still hot store leftover sausages in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 days you can also freeze the leftovers for up to 30 days method2 boiled and fried1 combine the sausage and water place the sausage links in a deep medium skillet pour 14 cup 60 ml of water into the skillet as well 4the water level should not be high enough to completely cover the sausages while you can technically cook any type of breakfast sausage using this method its best to use it for skinless or fresh links this method may not be as effective for links with skin or sausage patties2 cook off the water place the skillet on the stove over mediumhigh heat simmer the sausage for 6 to 7 minutes or until the water evaporates continue cooking as long as it takes for the water to naturally evaporate do not drain off any of the water similarly do not add more water if it evaporates faster than anticipated do not cover the pan since doing so may slow or prevent the steam from escaping slowing the overall cooking process as a result3 fry the sausage for 6 to 7 minutes reduce the heat to mediumlow and continue cooking the sausages uncovered for another 6 to 7 minutes or until theyre cooked through use tongs to periodically turn the sausage links as they cook doing so should promote even browning on all sides note that you should not add any extra oil or fat during the frying part of this process the fat rendered from the sausages should be enough to cook them when ready the sausages should be brown throughout and the juices should run clear if you check the internal temperature the center of the thickest sausage should be a minimum of 160 degrees fahrenheit 70 degrees celsius4 drain and serve remove the sausages from the skillet and set them onto several layers of paper towel to drain after 1 or 2 minutes transfer the sausages to individual serving plates and enjoy any cooked sausages you dont use immediately should be refrigerated for 1 or 2 days or frozen for up to 30 days method3 baked1 preheat the oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit 200 degrees celsius meanwhile prepare a shallow baking pan or baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper 5the parchment paper prevents the sausages from sticking while also absorbing some of the excess fat that renders off during the cooking process if you cannot use parchment paper place a metal cooling or baking rack on top of the baking sheet instead the rack will allow the excess fat to drip off during the cooking process preventing the sausages from baking in that fat2 arrange the sausages on the pan line up the sausages on the baking sheet arranging them in a single layer and leaving at least 1 inch 25 cm of space between them you can cook breakfast sausage links and breakfast sausage patties using this method the exact baking times may vary but the overall process should remain the same for both types roll breakfast sausage can be cooked using this method as well slice the roll into 12 inch 125 cm patties and treat those patties as you would treat the preformed version3 bake until cooked through place the sausages in the preheated oven cook sausage patties for 15 to 16 minutes cook sausage links for 20 to 25 minutes both links and patties should be turned once halfway through the cooking process to promote even browning on both sides when ready the sausages should be browned throughout and the juices should run clear the internal temperature at the center of each portion should be a minimum of 160 degrees fahrenheit 70 degrees celsius4 serve warm remove the sausages from the oven and transfer them to individual serving plates enjoy them while theyre still hot if the sausages are still too greasy for your liking after removing them from the oven you can blot away any excess grease using clean paper towels any unused sausage can be refrigerated for 1 or 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month method4 broiled1 preheat the broiler turn the broiler on and allow it to warm up for about 3 to 5 minutes most broilers only have an “on” and “off” setting but some also have “low” and “high” settings for the latter preheat the broiler on “low”2 place the sausage near the heat arrange the sausages in a single layer on a broiler pan place the pan in the preheated broiler 4 to 6 inches 10 to 15 cm away from the top heating element 6if you do not have a broiler pan place a metal coolingcooking rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet and use that instead you need to use something that allows the fat to drain as the sausages cook so you should avoid using a flat baking sheet on its own both sausage links and sausage patties can be cooked using this method for sausage links place the rack 4 to 5 inches 10 to 125 cm away from the heating element for sausage patties keep the rack 6 inches 15 cm away from the same element for roll breakfast sausage slice the roll into 12 inch 125 cm thick portions and treat each portion as though it were a preformed patty3 broil for 6 minutes broil the sausages for 3 minutes then turn them over to the other side continue cooking for another 3 minutes or until the juices run clear and the centers are no longer pink this amount of time should work for both breakfast patties and breakfast links but links may benefit from more frequent cooking and in some instances may cook a little faster than patties the internal temperature of both links and patties should reach at least 160 degrees fahrenheit 70 degrees celsius before you remove the sausages from the broiler4 serve warm remove the sausages from the broiler and transfer them to individual serving plates enjoy them while theyre still hot if you do not eat the sausages immediately refrigerate them for 1 or 2 days or freeze them for as long as 1 month method5 reheated1 reheat cooked sausages in the microwave to reheat precooked sausages microwave them on full power for 10 to 15 seconds per portion this method can be used for both sausages cooked at home or precooked packaged sausages it also works with both links and patties arrange the sausages in a single layer over a microwavesafe plate lined with paper towels cover them with an additional paper towel to reduce splatter microwave thawed sausages for about 10 seconds per link or patty for frozen sausages reheat them for 15 seconds per link or patty note that exact cooking times may vary depending on the power output of your microwave2 alternatively reheat cooked sausages on the stove warm the sausages through for 8 to 10 minutes using medium heat as with the microwave method you can use this method for nearly any type of precooked breakfast sausage links or patties homecooked or packagedcooked thawed or frozen place the links or patties in single layer in a cool nonstick pan cover the pan and set it on the stove over medium heat reheat the sausages for 8 minutes if previously thawed or 10 minutes from frozen you should not need to turn the sausages while they reheat when ready the sausages should be warmed throughout3 finished youre helping people by reading wiki howwiki hows mission is to help people learn and we really hope
