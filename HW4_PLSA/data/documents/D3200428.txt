home  college discussion  transfer students  uc transfers we are excited to announce a new role on college confidential the forum champion read all about it and apply now new discussion cal grant a vs cal grant bkkiiji registered user posts 583member04262009 at 1211 pm edited july 2010 in uc transfers award status cal grant a  qualified  not awarded cal grant b  awarded cal grant c  not awarded so apparently i qualified for both a and b but the system picked b for me and not a with the reason that its more advantageous for me to get b does anyone know why this is how much does cal grant b give to a junior year transfer student per year post edited by kkiiji on july 2010reply« 1 2 3 »replies to cal grant a vs cal grant b1pinkerfloyd registered user posts 1486senior member04262009 at 1214 pmwhere do you see this info did you get an email from cal grant notifying you that your cal grant has been processed reply2loopincposts 362member04262009 at 1215 pm hey i know why you need to log on to your cal grant site and see which college has it been mentioned if they have mentioned some college other than ucla most commonly usc you need to call them up and have it fixed i have usc on my info so i havent received anything but i plan to call them up the first thing once i hear from ucla reply3kkiiji registered user posts 583member04262009 at 1220 pm i saw it on the webgrant site where you login linked to your fafsa app httpsmygrantinfocsaccagov this was for ucsd but no award details came with it im just curious as to what the difference is the explanations i found online didnt help much something about freshmen getting 1551 only with cal grant b but im no freshmen reply4tiberius registered user posts 597member04262009 at 1240 pm ive been accepted to ucla and most likely will attend but have not heard from berkeley yet ive been awarded cal grant a but i need to fill out additional information i am asked what schools i expect to attend for the 0910 school year would it be fine if i listed both ucla and berkeley or will there be some type of conflict reply5jdecker1registered user posts 133junior member04262009 at 114 pm has anyone checked their cal grant status and seen that it was processed only to click on their award detail and have no information for this ss  and award period in bold red letters i am pretty sure im qualified for this grant and the fact that its mia is scaring me half to death has this happened to anyone only to see that the award appear a few days later any input would be much appreciated nervous wreck here and i was thinking even if i was denied wouldnt at least tell me that on there reply6vyruz reaper registered user posts 239junior member04262009 at 130 pmkkiiji i got the same response as you reply7kkiiji registered user posts 583member04262009 at 138 pmjdecker yes i had the processing status and now i got the above stated response now does anyone have any idea what it means to have gotten cal grant b over cal grant a as a transfer student reply8loller90278registered user posts 552member04262009 at 141 pm award status cal grant a  qualified  not awarded cal grant b  awarded cal grant c  not awarded got that as well reply9smcstudent registered user posts 14new member04262009 at 157 pm here is the description i got from another colleges financial aid website occidental cal grants the california student aid commission csac awards cal grants a and b to california residents as determined by eligibility requirements set by the state of california cal grant a entitlement requirements include financial and basic eligibility criteria and a minimum high school gpa of 30 fulltime students awarded a cal grant are eligible to receive between 7449 and 9708 based on the state budget as long as they maintain eligibility under state criteria cal grant b entitlement requirements include financial and basic eligibility criteria and a minimum high school gpa of 20 first‑year students receive a living stipend second‑ third‑ and fourth‑year students receive both a living stipend and a tuition grant currently the living stipend is 1551 and the tuition grant is between 7449 and 9708 based on the state budget for fulltime students competitive cal grant a and b awards awards are similar to the entitlement awards except that they are not guaranteed each year competitive awards are available to those students who did not receive an entitlement award i assume the same would go for ucs here is also a link to the cal grant site with more info httpwwwcalgrantsorgindexcfmnav id11reply10jdecker1registered user posts 133junior member04262009 at 215 pm kkiiji just to be sure so you originally saw that your application had been processed but had no reward and then your award appeared at a later time if this is the case how long was the interval in between i need to know when to panic and call thank you again reply11kkiiji registered user posts 583member04262009 at 245 pm you panic and call after may 1st so i suppose for cal grant b id get 77501551 thats a lot of money yay reply12vyruz reaper registered user posts 239junior member04262009 at 256 pmyeah but you loose your other grants in this case i loose my 10800 uci grant it just doesnt make any sense reply13kkiiji registered user posts 583member04262009 at 258 pm uhh says who i had both cal grant a and ucsd grant in my award estimate to begin with changing cal grant a to cal grant b shouldnt really affect my ucsd grant reply14vyruz reaper registered user posts 239junior member04262009 at 301 pm i called uci  ucsb and davis they all said they would their explanation is there are other kids with financial need and since im getting my cal grant they will give that money to someone else i didnt call ucsd but it seems to be the same with all the ucs im actully thinking about ucsd too since i got rejected to ucla so ill report back tomorrow reply15pinkerfloyd registered user posts 1486senior member04262009 at 432 pmmy calgrant award detail shows that both a and b are pending last i checked on friday there was no information available i dont expect to see uclas award summary just yet but with ucsb there isnt even mention of a cal grant do you guys think theyll just add my calgrant award or denial of award to my summary automatically as it becomes available or will i have to notify them separately myself reply« 1 2 3 » this
