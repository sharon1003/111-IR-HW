site point using srtm 90m dem now my task is to create a reservoir or pondage where water would be collected from the watershed above a watershed can be seen with a red line on which dam can be created a dam also has a reservoir where water is collected and it is always inside the watershed now problem is to delineate that reservoir practically reservoir should be in lowest elevation flat area so can we create such using dem dataarcgisdesktop dem watershedshare improve this questionedited dec 1 15 at 1206hornbydd234k 3 24 54asked dec 1 15 at 804user3073918 31construct like going in the field and building it – iris dec 1 15 at 815oh i meant create using arcmap – user30739 dec 1 15 at 820if i am not wrong it should be the lowest elevation surface from the point of dam site to the inside of watershed – user30739 dec 1 15 at 823i can try to be much more clear there is no need to give my question a negative vote – user30739 dec 1 15 at 9091i still dont understand your question what is a dam site point and how do you want to create a dam do you want to change your srtm that it has a dam like feature do you want to model a 3dfeature do you want to create a point feature where you would build a dam in realtion to the length of a river – iris dec 1 15 at 913show 3 more comments2 answers active oldest votesup vote3down voteaccepted im not an expert in defining reservoir limits and capacities so my suggestion may be too crude or even flawed to pond up behind the dam you have to know the height of the dam that seems fundamental to me for arguments sake lets say its 50m clip your elevation raster back to your watershed boundary identify the height of the cell where your dam will be placed in this clipped elevation for arguments sake lets say it was 200m200  50  250m which is the maximum elevation will pond up behind extract cells that are 250m or less the boundary of this would be the limits of the reservoir below is an example of the steps i describe above a clipped out grid extracting and coding cells below a set height note the areas identified by the arrows these are areas outside my crudely clipped catchment which fulfil the requirements if you have created a watershed using the hydrological tools then this should not occurshare improve this answeredited dec 1 15 at 1821answered dec 1 15 at 1215hornbydd234k 3 24 54add a commentup vote1down vote i would suggest using the contour with barriers tool its available with the spatial analyst extension at all license levels basically you create a polylinepolygon vector layer ahead of time that represents your dam then you designate a starting elevation and it will build contours from there based on your dem and then increment at whatever intervals you decide this allows you to test multiple dam heights at once to keep things clean and to potentially improve performance you may want to clip the dem to your watershed boundary before running the tool as hornbydd suggests after you have chosen the contour line you like convert it to a polygon and you have your reservoir surfaceshare improve this answeredited dec 1 15 at 1611answered dec 1 15 at 1555baltok1151 8 10seems much easier but polygons arent formed in arcmap 101 – user30739 dec 2 15 at 927they arent formed in 103 either thats why i said convert it to a polygon in my last sentence there are tools and methods available to convert polylines to polygons that dont require an advanced license if that is an issue the real benefit to this tool is that you can experiment with different dam heights all at once to see how it affects reservoir surfaces – baltok dec 2 15 at 1525add a comment your answer sign up or log in sign up using google sign up using facebook sign up using email and password post as a guest name email
