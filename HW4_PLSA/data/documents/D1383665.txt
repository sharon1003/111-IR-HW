number of lymph nodes removed determines colon cancer survival a second analysis of int0089aug 1 2000volume 9issue 8gastrointestinal cancer colorectal cancer philadelphianearly 45 of all cases of colon cancer have lymph node involvement surgical resection is the gold standard of treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy used in an attempt to improve survival in patients with latestage disease but the outlook is often dismal a study reported at the recent asco meeting shows that survival for these patients may be directly related to the number of lymph nodes removed researchers from fox chase cancer center cancer and leukemia group b the southwest oncology group and the eastern cooperative oncology group took a second look at the ncisponsored int0089 trialan adjuvant chemotherapy trial of stage iii and highrisk stage ii patients on 5fubased regimens randomized among four treatment arms reanalysis revealed that among nodenegative patients those who benefited most from surgical resection had more than 20 nodes removed this resulted in an absolute improvement in survival of 14 at 5 years and 20 at 8 years for nodepositive patients the number of nodes removed also affected overall survival a 23 improvement in survival at 5 years and 34 at 8 years in n1 patients is achieved if more than 40 nodes are removed the absolute improvement at 5 years and 8 years for these patients is 20 and 28 respectively if more than 35 nodes are removed colon cancer is marked by several wellknown prognostic factorsdepth of penetration t stage tumor grade and type the presence of vascular and lymphatic invasion and lymph node involvement of these factors nodal involvement is probably most significant said thomas le voyer md the lead author of the study from fox chase survival he said diminishes proportionally to the number of nodes involved a 1979 study conducted by enker et al found a survival improvement for patients with stage iii colon and rectal cancer that was related to an increase in the number of nodes removed dr le voyer and his colleagues used this 21yearold study as the basis of their hypothesis we were interested in evaluating the premise that removing more lymph nodes would equal more survival dr le voyer said dr le voyer and his colleagues next turned their attention to a reevaluation of int0089 because int0089 was the largest prospective trial on colon cancer with similar outcomes in treatment arms we thought it was a good vehicle to evaluate survival as it relates to node removal he said data from all 3557 patients in the trial were available for review and 3411 of these met all the criteria for the current analysis median followup was 79 months multivariate analyses were performed on nodepositive and nodenegative groups separately to ascertain the effect of lymph node removal dr le voyer said looking at demographics positive nodes were found in 1515 men and 1248 women negative nodes in 334 men and 314 women the median age for the node positive group was 639 and for the negative group it was 623 the mean number of negative nodes removed was 13 n  648 range 1 to 59 the mean number of positive nodes removed was 12 n  1857 range 1 to 80 the majority of the positive nodes were stage t3 11 were t1 and t2 and the negative nodes were evenly split between t3 and t4 most were found either in the right side of the colon or in the sigmoid however there were 89 synchronous tumor sites found the endpoints of the analysis were overall survival with death as an event and cancerspecific survival with death due to colon cancer as an event the covariates looked at were sex t stage number of positive lymph nodes total number of lymph nodes removed tumor differentiation and type and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens age and the number of lymph nodes removed were the only significant variables affecting overall survival in nodenegative patients see table for cancerspecific survival only the number of lymph nodes removed was predictive nodenegative patients who had 1 to 10 nodes removed had a median 5year survival of 73 if more than 20 nodes were removed median 5year survival improved to 87  p  0001 again for the nodepositive patients the only significant covariate affecting overall survival and cancerspecific survival was the number of lymph nodes removed table those patients who had 1 to 10 lymph nodes removed had a median 5year survival of 67 with more than 40 nodes removed survival jumped to 90 when you analyze the two groups based on the number of positive nodes within the specimen those with 1 to 10 nodes removed had 175 positive nodes vs 203 in those with more than 40 nodes removed dr le voyer said the number of lymph nodes removed seems to have an impact on survival in colon cancer he concluded this factor should be taken into account when conducting future adjuvant trials and analyzing data he said related articles deep learningâ€“based tissue analysis may benefit colorectal
