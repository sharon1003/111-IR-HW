home  weight loss  5 foods you should never eat again5 foods you should never eat again photo credit thinkstock food advertising by when you are trying to improve your health and lose weight there are certain foods that you should avoid many of these foods are obviously unhealthy because they contain ingredients that are known to cause weight gain however some other foods which are not so obviously linked to weight gain can nevertheless turn out to be just as bad for you these foods are deeply problematic because most people do not know to avoid them and therefore end up consuming them much more often than they should here are 5 foods that you should never eat again1 white bread white bread is a staple in most pantries but the truth is that it doesn’t have any nutritional value white bread contains a lot of sugar and it doesn’t have the ability to keep you satisfied so within a few hours you are likely to find yourself feeling hungry and reaching for snacks as a result of these factors it is unsurprising that research on those who eat white bread shows a correlation between eating larger quantities of white bread and being more likely to gain unwanted weight over a period of 12 years as it turns out even breads that claim to be wheat could contain more sugar than grain and should often be avoided ideally you should replace your white bread with whole grain or whole wheat bread whenever possible as whole wheat bread is positively good for your health bake your own bread – order breadmaker now for example it is a source of gammaoryzanol which lowers cholesterol levels if consumed on a regular basis and some studies even suggest that women who eat the largest amount of whole grains are around 40 less likely to develop breast cancer when compared to women who eat the smallest amount of whole grains in addition don’t forget that you can also substitute white bread on your sandwiches with lettuce leaves or whole grain tortillas1 of 9you might also like celeb

daily diet all the time its means moderation and being active thats what dont kill them and not the rice reply patrick owen chadd may 8 2014 at 207 pm i have eaten white rice almost every day for my 50 years of life with no ill effects i am not fat certainly not obese…i am half japanese and when i am home in japan there is a nation of white rice eaters that are also some of the healthiest in the world…so white rice will always be on my list of foods to eat replykirkmcloren may 8 2014 at 425 pm i watched a chinese man at work lose weight rapidly with a rice mono diet replyfuzzball may 9 2014 at 202 pm i guess the chinese are the most unhealthy people on earth practically everything they eat is fried in a wok in fact people buy some much cooking oil here it amazes me they use more oil in a month than i used in a year and i did do some deep fat frying at home and they don’t drain it out it is served with the food and consumed replyjayson teeman may 9 2014 at 312 pm anything in moderation is ok period not as good as skipping them but we still have to enjoy life not just spend all our waking hours trying to think how to extend it no replyjayson teeman may 9 2014 at 313 pm btw‘white rice makes you fat’…explain to me that cultures that eat a lot of it are traditionally lean reply guest may 12 2014 at 724 pm these all are generally obvious but also what are your credentials for giving out nutritional recommendations i am sure you’re not a rd or even a tech reply guest may 12 2014 at 730 pm yes you are correct that white bread should be eaten less than whole grains but it does not need to be fully avoided it does have quite a bit of nutrients in them some of them being fortified for example white bread has a good amount of folate in it while whole grains does not so it is good to occasionally eat an enriched white bread and this is coming from a rd it isnt good to give out recommendations like this what should and shouldn’t be avoided is different for many people and with giving out statements like this can possibly harm someone replyarmine may 13 2014 at 630 pm you can talk all you want about what to eat or not eat but the real key is how much you eat ten years ago i’m 74 now i weighed 475 pounds and i decided to lose the weight all i did was to cut my portions in half at regular meals i did not do extra exercise nor did i change the food i ate it took me 5 years but i now weigh 240 i also know exactly what to do to lose weight portions are the key exercise improves metabolism and general health but is not the key to weight loss i did not eat unhealthy food when i was heavy just ate too much i changed my life and i’m sure it extended my life i’m waiting for great great grand kids now reply asian magnolia may 13 2014 at 848 pm i can’t believe white rice is included in this list…most asian countries including where i came from eat white rice 3x a day…asians have lower cancer rate healthier stronger and live longer than most westerners do reply nova doc may 14 2014 at 910 pm guess i’ll have to give up the deep fried twinkie sandwich on wonder bread with 1000 island dressing replyripper may 15 2014 at 946 am sorry but if all these foods were as dangerous as claimed here 80 of the world population will drop dead before they reach 50 eat whatever you like once in a while with restraint nothing wrong with eating home made french fries 2 times per month and nothing wrong with rice there are chinese people who ate nothing but white rice and dried fish their whole life and got to become a century old reply jeff carnes may 15 2014 at 512 pm typical bunch of garbage i quit reading when i got to 4 white rice seriously tell that to asians who have some of the the longest lifespans in the world that eat white rice at every meal my mother is japanese and is 72 years old…and still gets mistaken as my sister not to be too obvious or anything but the problem with the american diet is less about what is eaten than it is about how much is eaten portion sizes in the us are ridiculous reply keeping it real may 16 2014 at 352 pm false syllogisms everyone breaths air everyone who breaths air will die therefore the air you breath will lead to your demise obviously this is untrue but an example of fallacies in logic don’t believe everything you read reply llarry llama may 17 2014 at 1224 am falling off my chair laughing at the absurdity of some of this article “white rice is bad” really i don’t see very many asians with necks so fat you can’t tell where the shoulders end and the head begins such as you see here in america the real culprit in weight gain isn’t so much fat it is eating a high amount of refined sugars and sitting on your ass for most hours of the day watching tv reply vivek ki maa june 3 2014 at 433 am its called obesity and its genetic its more prevalent among asians as they tend to marry and mate within their sectcaste so there is a higher probability of them being obese reply bug s bunny may 19 2014 at 724 pm i’ve lost 70 pounds in 15 weeks twice the second time i swore i’d never lose weight again while i do agree with some of the things in this article others are a toss up creambased salad dressings go a long way there’s no need to pile them on i don’t eat white bread tastes like starch white potatos tasteless until you pile on the calorieladen toppings so why not just eat the toppings and skip the potato  mayonnaise tastes like fat because that’s what it ismustard has way more flavor any kind of processed sugar makes me sick pepperoni pure grease bacon again pure grease soft drinks they’re either sugar or chemicals neither is good ground beef less than 85 lean too much grease even when grilled shortening or anything made with it pure grease again to make it simple cut out the junk from your diet and start exercising reply spinmastermay 20 2014 at 1030 pm this is pure nonsense how come asians eat rice everyday and a lot of them live to be 100 moderation you can eat just about anything as long as you do it in moderation i’m 6’2′ 190 pds and 58 yrs young i walk ride bike and do calestenics 5 days a week for at least an hour i eat rice fried foods and ice cream and cake too i do drink 2 cups of coffee everyday and a glass of red wine or 2with my evening meal ohh and i drink green tea often no pills of any kind for nothing butyou gotta get up off your duff and exercise do something replycaptainhurt may 24 2014 at 703 pm this i pure nonsense how come asians don’t do calisthenics everyday and a lot of them live to be 100 i sit around most all the day but watch what i eat no cakes no cookies no milk no ice cream no workouts for nothing but you gotta watch what you eat eat less reply miriam israel may 21 2014 at 710 pmohhh good griefreply rys may 22 2014 at 838 am i’d like to point out that when made properly fried foods shouldn’t have much oil in them at all it’s when the steam made by the food in the frying process stops pushing out on the oil trying to push inthat’s when you hit problems temps too high and you run out of moisture in the food to keep the oil out before it’s done cooking temps too low and you won’t make enough pressure to ‘fight back’ and you get oillogged if you monitor the heat and do it right the food will be just fine it’s not health food but it surely won’t be as bad as you think replysusie may 22 2014 at 144 pmthe fact that they said to eat low fat salad dressings proves they don’t know shit there is always something added to give it flavor like more sodium etc read the labels and make good choices and i’m not giving up my blue cheese dressing reply spinner123may 23 2014 at 1241 pm who ever eats 2 tablespoons of salad dressing anyway i usually get by just fine with about a teaspoon even less reply bubbawubba gump may 23 2014 at 414 pm child birth is the worst thing for you did you know that being born leads to death within 200 years an amazing 100 of the time it should be banned immediatelyreplycaptainhurt may 24 2014 at 716 pmmuddled thinking its important to make rational distinctions of any action esp what you eat reply bubbawubba gump may 28 2014 at 445 pm you are right the same muddled thinking that believes high fructose corn syrup is any different than honey or and other sugar my point you humorless shrews was that everything is bad for you if you eat too much of it this is a stupid attempt to make people believe that any one item is making them fat and sick rather than the fact that they don’t balance their diet or get enough exercisecaptainhurt may 29 2014 at 434 pmthis raises the question what is “balanced” and what is “enough”  similar to “moderation”  without context it means nothingbtw  different sugars impact the body dramatically differently as shown in any table of glycemic indexes as dramatically different as table sugar is from glucose sugaralcohols go even way beyond these differences with big mouth health issues and bone impacts and digestive bacteria impacts so it is important to make rational distinctions of foods even within a category and to classify certain foods as “bad” esp when other much more healthy options exist as another example of a common failure to make important distinctions “carbs” are a vague generatlization thats almost useless bubbawubba gump may 30 2014 at 327 pm btw sugar is sugar is sugar that is a fantasy the “health” food industry feed you chemically your body can’t know the difference because there is no difference the article was titled “food to never eat” demonizing foods rather than make any of your “important distinctions” in an idiotic “vague generalization” thank you for making my pointsusan may 27 2014 at 504 am said like a gop tea bagger 3rd grade drop outreplymarque2may 24 2014 at 453 am a bit of bs in the article whole grain breads aren’t particularly healthier and actually have higher glycemic indexes than the white bread high glycemic foods encourage the body to store fatthe real advice should be cut back on sugars and starches starches are in grains potatoes rice and products based on them – bread for instance get your sugar from fruits but avoid grapes and most berries and eat a lot of vegis and meats the stearic acid in pig and cow fat actually is a strong reducer of cholesterol reply nanette valencia may 25 2014 at 1254 am i eat all of these why didn’t i die reply jtmay 26 2014 at 824 ammy brain the whole time “no shit sherlock”replylaurie may 27 2014 at 136 am you lost your credibility when you suggested that we replace white bread with wheat bread for many people the gluten in wheat is a problem in fact the gmo wheat that is in much of our food is terrible for us before you run amok with a bunch of what to eat advice i suggest you do your homework reply qasim haji may 27 2014 at 327 pm my younger sister eats gluten free food and is lactose intolerant if she eats what she isn’t suppose to she gets badly sick she throws up and suffers for a week we went to dubai for my wedding and she ate everything and didn’t get sick even once she went to india to study for 6 months and again ate everything and never got sick once as soon as she got back and tried eating everything she suffered with terrible attacks in her stomach the food over here is bad my wife’s from dubai she’s been here for only 2 years and now she has a lot of health problems i’ve started investing in manuka honey chia seeds and wheat grass juice hoping to cleanse our system and strenghten it i really hope america changes the way our food is processed and sold reply agamemnonman may 28 2014 at 204 pm these foods are not “poison” they are foods that “some people” over indulge in moderation they have no harmful impact on people’s health but the same can be said about any item that is ingested even water reply lester baptiste may 28 2014 at 942 pm if brown rice didn’t taste like you were eating a brown bag maybe i’d eat it more oftenreply colleen johnson may 28 2014 at 1030 pm oh for god’s sake let’s just eat sand and dandelions and forget about the wonderful world that our taste buds are missing i understand wanting to be healthy but at what expense who wants to live forever anyway replypaul may 31 2014 at 805 amfriends health problems mostly are connected diet then how can we off load what is already in our bodies reply charley dow june 1 2014 at 955 pm rice is unhealthy

replyzerorez february 24 2015 at 348 am stop dieting change your lifestyle reply maarten s gravemade september 13 2015 at 409 pm so you’re basically telling me to ditch this and then i’ll be healthy well news flash constantly worrying about what you’re putting into your mouth isn’t healthy either all the stress will probably make you sick and you’ll die can you imagine forcing yourself to eat supposed health food because some guy on the television or internet told you you’ll become more healthy well its taking a huge toll on your psychological and mental health as well i know plenty of people who are 60 a bit of a beer belly eat what they want some even smoke and they do biking and walking and never had any complications this whole “health craze” is complete bull your weight is only one component of your overall health so if you’re happy with yourself eating what you want and your body then i think that’s a whole lot healthier than someone who forces themselves to eat supposed healthier options to become more healthier replygjmc gfjtcf nhv january 26 2016 at 227 pm i thought sugar was good for youreply← older comments leave a reply your email address will not be published
