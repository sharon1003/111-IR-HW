what is a geomagnetic storm geomagnetic storms are disturbances in earth’s magnetic field that can result in many hours of vibrant auroras both at high latitudes yukon northwest territories and nunavut and at lower latitudes southern canada and northern united states these storms often occur when a coronal mass ejection cme or a persistent high speed solar wind stream sweeps past earth causing the magnetic field to become unsettled if the unsettled conditions persist long enough a geomagnetic storm is possible while scientists cannot predict precisely when a storm will occur it is possible to predict when a coronal mass ejection cme or high speed solar wind stream will sweep past earth’s magnetic field creating the conditions that cause geomagnetic storms much like hurricanes and tornados there are different categories of geomagnetic stormsg1 minor geomagnetic storm when the kpindex measures kp5 a g1 minor geomagnetic storm is in effect g1 storm overviewg1 storms occur approximately 1700 times per 11 years 1 solar cyclethese storms can cause weak power grid fluctuationsminor impact on satellite operations is possiblethese storms can have an affect on migratory animals in northern regions aurorag1 minor storm events can produce many hours of vibrant auroras across the northwest territories nunavut and yukon periods of active auroras can also be seen at mid latitudes southern canada and northern united states including british columbia alberta saskatchewan manitoba as well as northern ontario northern quebec and northern newfoundland  labradorg2 moderate geomagnetic storm when the kpindex measures kp6 a g2 moderate geomagnetic storm is in effect g2 storm overviewg2 storms occur approximately 600 times per 11 years 1 solar cyclehighlatitude power systems may experience voltage alarmslongduration storms may cause transformer damage at high latitudescorrective actions may be required for spacecraft orientationaurorag2 moderate storm events can deliver many hours of vibrant auroras across the southern northwest territories nunavut and yukon periods of active auroras can also be seen at mid latitudes southern canada and the northern united states these storms often spark auroral displays above british columbia alberta saskatchewan manitoba ontario quebec and the maritime provincesg3 strong geomagnetic storm when the kpindex measures kp7 a g3 strong geomagnetic storm is in effect g3 storm overviewg3 storms occur approximately 200 times per 11 years 1 solar cyclepower systems may experience voltage alarms and require correctionscorrective actions may be required for spacecraft orientationlowfrequency radio navigation problems may occur aurorag3 strong storm events can deliver many hours of vibrant auroras across the southern northwest territories nunavut and yukon periods of active auroras can also be seen at mid latitudes southern canada and the northern united states these storms often spark auroral displays above british columbia alberta saskatchewan manitoba ontario quebec and the maritime provincesg4 severe geomagnetic storm when the kpindex measures kp8 a g4 severe geomagnetic storm is in effect g4 storm overviewg4 storms occur approximately 100 times per 11 years 1 solar cyclepower systems may experience widespread voltage control problems and some protective systems will mistakenly trip out key assets from the gridspacecraft may experience surface charging and tracking problemssatellite navigation degraded for hours aurorag4 severe geomagnetic storm events can deliver many hours of vibrant auroras across canada periods of active auroras can also be seen above the united states as far south as alabama and north carolina these storms often generate extended periods of active auroras above british columbia alberta saskatchewan manitoba ontario quebec and the maritime provincesg5 extreme geomagnetic storm when the kpindex measures kp9 a g5 extreme geomagnetic storm is in effect g5 storm overviewg5 storms occur approximately 4 times per 11 years 1 solar cyclepower systems may experience widespread voltage control problems and some grid systems may experience complete collapse or blackoutsspacecraft may experience surface charging and tracking problemssatellite navigation degraded for dayspipeline currents can reach hundreds of amps aurorag5 extreme geomagnetic storm events can deliver many hours of vibrant auroras across canada and the united states periods of active auroras can be seen as far south as texas and florida these storms often generate extended periods of active auroras above british columbia alberta saskatchewan manitobaontario quebec and the maritime provinces for more information on the scale for geomagnetic storms visit the national oceanic and atmospheric administration website
