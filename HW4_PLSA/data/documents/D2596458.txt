including the ability to heal certain cancers frankincense as a cancer fighter in fact researchers from leicester university say the gum resin frankincense contains a chemical compound that has the potential to kill cancer cells and that it may be a viable treatment of cancers such as breast prostate ovarian and colon the particular compound is acetyl11ketobetaboswellic acid akba and was studied at length by university experts and has been said to have the ability to fight off ovarian cancer cells even as they are in the last stage 2 after a year of studying the akba compound with ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro we have been able to show it is effective at killing the cancer cells said kamla alsalmani a ph d student from the universitys department of cancer studies and molecular medicine frankincense is taken by many people with no known sideeffects even more promising is their finding that the frankincense compound is effective even among cancer cells that have been

agreement with the oman government and can harvest frankincense purity is key and i would only trust yl dr hk lin at ou university is one of the scientist participating in the research and my understanding is they used yl sacred frankincense you can also look into sacred arrow who donates sacred frankincense to cancer patients if you have questions please pm me i can provide you the specific studies and more detailed info about hk lin research janet p jackson alan prokes • 1 year ago actually janet we test a lot of oils and i have found young living to smell lovely jovely but lack a great deal in therapeutic benefit compared to some out there but it sounds good doesnt it the deal with the oman government in fact it sounds very very self important it is a multi level marketing company which typically as they all do teach nothing about their core business which is marketing the most important thing is you believe the hype told by gary young and you do successful marketing for him dont you think we joined young living mainly to get the roller glides and to test his oils after trying the free roller glide one with the kit we decided against it his oils do not stack up so well against top grade essential oils dont send them to me for testing as i am not an authorised tester but you can try the essential oil university as he really knows his stuff and is a qualified phd in biochemistry the yl thieves oil is exactly that thievery gary you are a disgrace personally i have found that cancer inspite what the pharma mob says is not hard to cure please look at dr sebi and go from there he did a very good interview on the rock newman show very good i say beacause he is the only person to claim to cure all diseases and be taken to the supreme court by the fda and win young living is a marketing con and it conned you their oils smell fantastic but i have found them to be lacking alan prokes hs • 3 years agodo terra frankincense also comes from an area of oman i do believe i know that do terra oils are certified pure therapeutic grade oils each batch tested by 3 independent labs not affiliated with the company i have heard that yl and do terra are the 2 best companies out there and the decision on which to use is a personal one brenda reeves • 3 years ago how do you use the frankincense and myrth to heal cancer do you injest it or use as

horrified by the way the fda is suppressing the information to the public since i dont work for do terra i can say what do terra people are not allowed to say anymore they are antibacterial antiviral and antifungal there i said it and im gladruth gough • 3 years ago branda the fda requires that we be very clear that any of these natural remedies have not been studies or cleared by the fda and that all claims however deeply rooted they may be in actual scientific even clinical proof are not cleared by the fda or any other government agency now with that out of the way i would encourage you to

gold octavia • 2 years ago wow never heard of that but i will do more research julie berry clark • 3 years ago thats interestingode2b17 • 3 years ago indeed frankincense may affect the cannabinoid system and fit the chemicallock that causes apoptosis in cancer cells similar to cannabis oil yet trillions of dollars in rd for cancer cannot make the industry see this amazing substance j przybilla
