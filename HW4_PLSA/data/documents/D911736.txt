rainstorm blobs of a translucent gelatinous substance each half the size of grains of rice fell at the farmhouse of sunny barclift 5 shortly afterwards barclifts mother dotty hearn was rushed to the hospital suffering from dizziness and nausea and barclift and a friend also suffered minor bouts of fatigue and nausea after handling the blobs however dr david litle who treated hearn expressed doubt that hearns symptoms were due to the blobs and appeared instead to have been caused by an inner ear condition hearn herself also acknowledged that the appearance of the blobs could have been a mere coincidence unconnected with their maladies it was also reported that sunnys kitten had died after contact with the blobs following a battle with severe intestinal problems prior to the incident the blobs were confirmed to have fallen a second time at the barclift farm but no one was reported to have fallen ill the second time 6several attempts were made to identify the blobs with barclift initially asking her mothers doctor to run tests on the substance at the hospital litle obliged and reported that it contained human white blood cells barclift also managed to persuade mike osweiler of the washington state department of ecologys hazardous materials spill response unit to examine the substance while white blood cells contain nuclei further examination by osweilers staff reported that the blobs contained cells that lacked this cellular structure 7several theories cropped up at the time to explain the appearance of the blobs though none have been proven correct a popular theory with the townsfolk at the time was the jellyfish theory which postulated that the blobs were the result of bombing runs by the military in the ocean 50 miles 80 km away from the farm causing explosion within a smack of jellyfish which were then dispersed into a rain cloud 6 although neither barclift nor osweiler favoured the idea the theory was so popular with the townsfolk that there was discussion of holding a jellyfish festival and that the local tavern even concocted a new drink in honor of the incident the jellyfish composed of vodka gelatin and juice another theory propagated by david litle who handled the original analysis of the blobs was that the blobs were drops of concentrated fluid waste from an airplane toilet though when barclift contacted the faa about this later this idea was rebuffed as she was told that all commercial plane toilet fluids are dyed blue a property the blobs did not possess 5geography  editoakville is located at 46°50′22″n 123°14′1″w 46839312
