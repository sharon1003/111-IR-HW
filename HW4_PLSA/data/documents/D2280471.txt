modular arithmeticintroduction modular arithmetic is a special type of arithmetic that involves only integers this goal of this article is to explain the basics of modular arithmetic while presenting

with a starting at noon the hour hand points in order to the following this is the way in which we count in modulo 12 when we add to we arrive back at the same is true in any other modulus modular arithmetic system in modulo we count we can also count backwards in modulo 5 any time we subtract 1 from 0 we get 4 so the integers from to when written in modulo 5 arewhere is the same as in modulo 5 because all integers can be expressed as or in modulo 5 we give these integers their own name the residue classes modulo 5 in general for a natural number that is greater than 1 the modulo residues are the integers that are whole numbers less than  this just relates each integer to its remainder from the division theorem while this may not seem all that useful at first counting in this way can help us solve an enormous array of number theory problems much more easilyresidue we say that is the modulo residue of when and  congruence there is a mathematical way of saying that all of the integers are the same as one of the modulo 5 residues for instance we say that 7 and 2 are congruent modulo 5 we write this using the symbol in other words this means in base 5 these integers have the same residue modulo 5 the mod 5 part just tells us that we are working with the integers modulo 5 in modulo 5 two integers are congruent when their difference is a multiple of 5 in general two integers and are congruent modulo when is a multiple of in other words when is an integer otherwise which means that and are not congruent modulo  examplesbecause is a multiple ofbecause which is an integerbecause which is not a multiple ofbecause which is not an integer sample problem find the modulo residue of  solution since r we know thatand is the modulo residue of  another solution since we know that we can now solve it easilyand is the modulo residue of making computation easier we dont always need to perform tedious computations to discover solutions to interesting problems if all we need to know about are remainders when integers are divided by then we can work directly with those remainders in modulo this can be more easily understood with a few examples addition problem suppose we want to find the units digit of the following sum  we could find their sum which is and note that the units digit is however we could find the units digit with far less calculation solution we can simply add the units digits of the addends the units digit of this sum is which must be the same as the units digit of the fourdigit sum we computed earlier why we only need to use remainders we can rewrite each of the integers in terms of multiples of and remainders when we add all four integers we get at this point we already see the units digits grouped apart and added to a multiple of which will not affect the units digit of the sum solution using modular arithmetic now lets look back at this solution using modular arithmetic from the start note that because we only need the modulo residue of the sum we add just the residues of the summandsso the units digit of the sum is just  addition rule in general when and are integers and is a positive integer such thatthe following is always true and as we did in the problem above we can apply more pairs of equivalent integers to both sides just repeating this simple principle proof of the addition rule let and where and are integers adding the two equations we get which is equivalent to saying subtraction the same shortcut that works with addition of remainders works also with subtraction problem find the remainder when the difference between and is divided by  solution note that and so thusso 1 is the remainder when the difference is divided by perform the subtraction yourself divide by and see subtraction rule when and are integers and is a positive integer such thatthe following is always true multiplication modular arithmetic provides an even larger advantage when multiplying than when adding or subtracting lets take a look at a problem that demonstrates the point problem jerry has boxes of soda in his truck the cans of soda in each box are packed oddly so that there are cans of soda in each box jerry plans to pack the sodas into cases of cans to sell after making as many complete cases as possible how many sodas will jerry have leftover solution first we note that this word problem is asking us to find the remainder when the product is divided by  now we can write each and in terms of multiples of and remainders this gives us a nice way to view their product using foil we get that this equals we can already see that each part of the product is a multiple of except the product of the remainders when each and are divided by 12 that part of the product is which leaves a remainder of when divided by so jerry has sodas leftover after making as many cases of as possible solution using modular arithmetic first we note that thusmeaning there are sodas leftover yeah that was much easier multiplication rule when and are integers and is a positive integer such that the following is always true exponentiation since exponentiation is just repeated multiplication it makes sense that modular arithmetic would make many problems involving exponents easier in fact the advantage in computation is even larger and we explore it a great deal more in the intermediate modular arithmetic article note to everybody exponentiation is very useful as in the following problem problem 1what is the last digit of if there are 1000 7s as exponents and only one 7 in the middle we could solve this problem using mods this can also be stated as after that we see that 7 is congruent to 1 in mod 4 so we can use this fact to replace the 7s with 1s because 7 has a pattern of repetitive period 4 for the units digit is simply 1 so therefore which really is the last digit problem 2what are the tens and units digits of  we could in theory solve this problem by trying to compute but this would be extremely timeconsuming moreover it would give us much more information than we need since we want only the tens and units digits of the number in question it suffices to find the remainder when the number is divided by in other words all of the information we need can be found using arithmetic mod  we begin by writing down the first few powers of mod  a pattern emerges we see that mod  so for any positive integer we have mod  in particular we can write mod  by the multiplication property above then it follows that mod  therefore by the definition of congruence differs from by a multiple of since both integers are positive this means that they share the same tens and units digits those digits are and respectively problem 3can you find a number that is both a multiple of but not a multiple of and a perfect square no you cannot rewriting the question we see that it asks us to find an integer that satisfies  taking mod on both sides we find that now all we are missing is proof that no matter what is will never be a multiple of plus so we work with cases this assures us that it is impossible to find such a number summary of useful facts consider four integers and a positive integer such that and in modular arithmetic the following identities hold addition subtraction multiplication division where is a positive integer that divides and exponentiation where is a positive
