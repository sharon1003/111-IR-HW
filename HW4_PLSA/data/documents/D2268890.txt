here it is the best of the best the fourth and the last part of the top 40 product placements of all time just a quick reminder – this is my personal and very subjective list based on the movies i’ve seen articles and books i’ve read the available data and my personal affinity no 10 – pepsi and nike in back to the future the back to the future trilogy is a comedic science fiction film series directed by robert zemeckis since it involves time travelling it also presents an opportunity to showcase different brands in different time periods some brands notably pepsi and nike have embraced the opportunity and made examples of great product placement some reports suggest that zemeckis at first wanted to have cocacola in the movie but realised that cocacola’s bottle was basically the same throughout the 20 th century so he approached pepsi which was willing to participate nike shoes in back to the future 2 1989 universal pictures screen capturethe trilogy begins in 1985 when marty mc fly is accidentally sent back to 1955 in a time machine built by eccentric scientist emmett l brown also known as “doc” the most interesting product placement occurred in the second movie when marty was sent to 2015 there he finds a pepsi perfect and special lacefree nike shoes in 2008 nike made special limited edition hyperdunk sneakers that were very similar to those from the movie however only about 1000 pairs were made can we expect another model in four years time nike hyperdunk no 9 – apple i pad in modern family i included i pad’s placement from the tv series modern family in 2010 overview as the best product placement of the year it was awesome the episode with i pad as a focal point of the story was aired just three days before the stores started selling apple’s new gadget the plot was flawless the dunphy family tried to buy their dad an i pad for his birthday which coincided with the device’s launch day of course family members didn’t preorder it so they tried desperately to fulfill their father’s birthday wish phil dunphy is a bit of a geeky dad and calls himself an early adopter the fact that i pad goes on sale on his birthday is an additional effect to his desire for it he even said “it’s like god and steve jobs got together to say ‘we love you phil’”the product was integrated in the plot it was mentioned in different contexts it was shown on the screen it was used and it achieved the “i want to buy this product” effect phil and his new toy in modern family s01e19 2010 abc screen captureno 8 – ray ban and us navy in top gun as i said in the

paramount screen captureno 7 – reese’s pieces in e t reese’s pieces is a citizen kane of product placement this is one of the classic examples of successful product placement that was part of many marketing books articles and blog posts for a really top product placement you have to be involved in a successful movie or tv series e t was a huge blockbuster this case became famous because there were two brands involved the big mm’s and a relatively unknown reese’s pieces according to jeanmarc lehu’s book branded entertainment steven spielberg had initially made contact with the brand leader in the confectionery market mars to ask permission to use mm’s but mars declined the offer probably they’ve thought that it was not worthwhile spielberg then decided to film the scene with reese’s pieces from mars’ competitor hershey when the movie was finished it was spielberg who proposed a tiein promotion to hershey which they accepted reese’s pieces participated in the film’s launch campaign investing 1 million and in return it was allowed to use the film in its advertising campaigns reese’s pieces had an important part of the story and are known as ufo’s candies the success of that placement was huge — reese’s pieces saw a reported 65 per cent jump in profits just two weeks after the movie’s premiere no 6 – rayban in risky business i suppose rayban and tom cruise were a perfect match in the 1980s tom first wore rayban’s model wayfarer in 1983 in comedy risky business and then aviators in top gun in 1986 rayban has been manufacturing wayfarer model since 1952 when their design was a revolutionary break from the metal eyewear of the past the model was popular in the 1950s and 1960s but then somehow faded from the limelight apparently annual sales were only about 18000 but then something changed in 1982 rayban signed a 50000ayear deal with unique product placement of burbank california to place raybans in movies and television shows risky business was the beginning of a wayfarers phenomenon tom cruise wore the model in the movie and they also put them on the cover of the movie this product placement contributed to fantastic sales that year 360000 pairs of wayfarers were sold in 1983 by 1986 after appearances in miami vice moonlighting and the breakfast club sales had reached 15 million rayban wayfarer sunglasses in risky business 1983 warner bros screen captureno 5 – fed ex in cast away in cast away tom hanks is chuck a fed ex employee who is stranded on an uninhabited island after fed ex’s plane crashes on a flight over the south pacific the film shows his attempts to survive on the island using leftovers of his plane’s cargo as well as his eventual escape and return to society that kind of placement can be a little extreme – you don’t really want the plane with your logo to crash into the ocean fed ex ’s placement was risky also because almost all cargo was lost an employee opened several packages even though he wasn’t authorized to do so we have to admit that he was alone on a desert island and one lost parcel was delivered with a very long delay however fed ex pulled it off brilliantly gayle christensen director of global brand management at fed ex said the scene in which the fed ex plane crashes into the ocean stranding hanks on a deserted island gave the company “a heart attack at first” fed ex admitted that they didn’t pay for product placement although they provided logistical support for the movie “the greatest impact for us was not in the u s since our brand awareness in the u s is very high” said christensen “where we did see a difference is offshore in asia and in europe where our brand awareness was not as high”fed ex packages in the movie cast away 2000 20th century fox screen captureno 4 – manolo blahnik in sex and the city manuel “manolo” blahnik rodríguez is a 69year old spanish fashion designer and founder of the selfnamed highend shoe brand he opened his first shop in 1973 by buying out an existing shop called zapata in london’s chelsea in the last couple of decades several celebrities wore his shoes and madonna even described them as “better than sex”manolo blahnik was sometimes described as the fifth lead in the tv series sex and the city mainly because of the sheer number of times his shoes were worn or mentioned by the famous four in one scene in the season 4 carrie found a pair of black shoes and said “oh my god do you know what these are manolo blahnik mary janes i thought these were an urban shoe myth”“i adore ms parker” blahnik once revealed “the character she played has had such a role in my career – i cannot help but regard both of them as muses” however in 2009 blahnik revealed in an interview with the sunday telegraph “if people talk to me about sex and the city i get sick the taxi drivers recognize me now it becomes too much and i don’t feel comfortable i have never wanted to be a celebrity designer”nevertheless carrie’s shoe obsession in sex and the city helped catapult manolo blahnik to international fame something all designers wish for manolo blahnik’s bag in the movie sex and the city 2008 new line cinema screen captureno 3 – ford mustang in bullitt i’ve started the blog post product placement highlights – ford mustang in bullitt with a question “which is the best and most famous carchase scene of all time” the answer a 9 minute and 42second drive through the hilly streets in and around san francisco from the movie bullitt it includes steve mc queen in 1968 ford mustang gt390 and two killers in a black dodge charger ford mustang was introduced in april 1964 it was stylish elegant and affordable car ford estimated that they would sell around 80000 mustangs in its first year but it sold more than a million in its first two years bullitt premiered in 1968 and made history with the carchase it is intense brilliantly executed and after all these years it still feels good when watching it in 2001 ford made a special version of its mustang gt with the bullitt nameplate and sold a total 5582 cars in 2007 they revealed a new version engineers modeled the car’s exhaust note on the engine sound heard in the original movie based on a specially mastered dvd to make it even more desirable ford decided to produce only 7700 units even though there were reports of 3000 additional units due to the high demand somehow i’d like to have a mustang …this replica of the 1968 mustang fastback gt 390 that costarred with steve mc queen in the movie bullitt retraces some of the original san francisco streets from the movie’s chase scene no 2 – kodak carousel in mad men to really understand this product placement you have to watch the first season of mad men in my opinion one of the best tv series ever made at the end of the last episode don draper has to present an idea for an ad for a new product to kodak’s representatives however because of his issues with the late brother his wife and his adultery problems at the agency he’s in a difficult state but nevertheless jon hamm produced arguably the best few minutes in the history of television kodak’s roduct placement had all elements of a great placementthe product is mentionedthe product is usedthe product is shown on screenthe product is emotionally attached to the main characterthe product is used as a metaphor i suggest you watch the clip with product placement for kodak carousel from this episode i’ll again use the words from one of my favourite tv critics alan sepinwall “how freakin’ great was don draper’s sales pitch to the kodak people so great that he wowed the kodak guys into cancelling their other pitches so great that it made me want to invest in a slide projector even in this age of digital photography so great that it sold don himself on illusion of the happy life he appears to share with betty”kudos to jon hamm and matt weiner the writer and executive producer for creating this masterpiece no 1 – wilson in cast away in my opinion there is only one product placement better than kodak carousel in mad men the winner is wilson from cast away i’ve mentioned several times there are three classic types of product placement a product or brand can be visible used or someone can mention it but in the year 2000 we had an excellent example of a fourth type a brand became the character wilson ball turning into wilson character in the movie cast away 2000 20th century fox screen capturewhen chuck tom hanks the main character from the movie crashed on the island he was there alone but somehow he got company … from the unlikeliest source when he opened boxes from the plane he found wilson volleyball that ball eventually became “wilson” chuck’s only company on the island this product placement is very interesting and special for one particular reason product was not just visible and used and chuck didn’t just speak about it – the product became a character it “listened” and provided company to chuck as a result of product placement wilson sporting goods company created a promotional ball complete with the facial markings as seen in the film interestingly in 2011 you can still buy wilson castaway volleyball from amazon or target wilson ball from amazoncom apparently wilson didn’t pay for product placement and even if it happened coincidentally if was perfect in my opinion it’s the best product placement ever hanks’ and wilson’s relationship was genuine and as a viewer i perceived wilson as a character not some branded product from a brand’s point of view that’s even better than highly visible placement or heavy usage and in case of wilson it was for free top 40 product placements of all time 2011top 40 product placements of all time 3021top 40 product placements of all time 4031the best of apple don draper
