the lambs towards the end – kevin feb 5 16 at 1824add a commentup vote37down vote the title comes from the very last line of the book as andrew martin states early in the book starling and lecter have a conversation about her having nightmares with screaming lambs and that she thinks the nightmares will stop if she can save catherine the book finishes with clarice starling having saved catherine and true to the conversation her nightmares have stopped but the face on the pillow rosy in the firelight is certainly that of clarice starling and she sleeps deeply sweetly in the silence of the lambsshare improve this answeranswered feb 5 16 at 1832kevin855 5 15spoiler as the silence could also refer to death of said lambs – cees timmerman oct 13 16 at 907add a commentup vote3down vote the
