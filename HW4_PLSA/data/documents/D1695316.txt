shannon macca 946 contributions what kind of landforms are formed at divergent plate boundaries mid ocean ridges and rift valleys what types of landforms are found at a divergent boundary occasionally midocean ridges are found at a divergent boundary another feature that is made is a rift valley also earthquake activity at fracture zones alone midocean 安hat landforms are formed at divergent boundaries in plate tectonics divergent boundaries occur when plates pullapart on land divergent boundaries form rifts or valleys morecommonly divergent boundaries in the ocean occu 安hat landforms are formed at a divergent boundarylandforms associated with divergent boundaries are known as island arc orogeny and they lead to formation of islands and volcanoes along with trenches example would be japa 安hat landforms are created by divergent boundaries mid ocean ridges are formed by divergent boundaries chazz555 102 contributions how do volcanoes form in divergent boundariesno yes and symp goldenflash19 3 contributions what landforms do you find in a divergent plate boundary ocean ridges jillianbeanpod 19 contributions what are formed at divergent and converging boundaries convergent and divergent boundaries are terms used in plate tectonics to describe the juncture at two plates and how they move in relation to each other divergent plates move 安hat are the landforms at divergent ocean plate boundariesmid ocean ridges types of landforms formed by divergent boundaries volcanoes are formed sorry thats all i know suma rongi 15099 contributions what can divergent boundaries form a rift zone on land a mid ocean ridge under the ocean what volcanoes form at divergent boundaries generally shield volcanoes form at divergent boundaries
