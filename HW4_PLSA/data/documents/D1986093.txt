foodpyramid called my pyramid makes exercise as well as food recommendations to emphasize theinterconnectedness between exercise diet and health precautions before beginning any exercise program an evaluation by a physician is recommended to rule outpotential health risks once health and fitness level are determined and any physical restrictionsidentified the individuals exercise program should begin under the supervision of a health care or other trained professional this is particularly true when exercise is used as a form of rehabilitation if symptoms of dizziness nausea excessive shortness of breath or chest pain are present duringexercise the individual should stop the activity and inform a physician about these symptomsbefore resuming activity exercise equipment must be checked to determine if it can bear the weight of people of all sizes and shapes individuals must be instructed in the proper use of exerciseequipment in order to prevent injury description range of motion exercise range of motion exercise refers to activity aimed at improving movement of a specific joint thismotion is influenced by several structures configuration of bone surfaces within the joint jointcapsule ligaments tendons and muscles acting on the joint there are three types of range of motion exercises passive active and active assists passive range of motion is movement applied to a joint solely by another person or persons or a passive motion machine when passive range of motion is applied the joint of an individual receiving exercise is completely relaxed while the outsideforce moves the body part such as a leg or arm throughout the available range injury surgery or immobilization of a joint may affect the normal joint range of motion active range of motion is movement of a joint provided entirely by the individual performing the exercise in this case there is no outside force aiding in the movement active assist range of motion is described as a jointreceiving partial assistance from an outside force this range of motion may result from the majority of motion applied by an exerciser or by the person or persons assisting the individual it also may be a halfandhalf effort on the joint from each source strengthening exercise strengthening exercise increases muscle strength and mass bone strength and the bodysmetabolism it can help attain and maintain proper weight and improve body image and selfesteem a certain level of muscle strength is needed to perform daily activities such as walking running andclimbing stairs strengthening exercises increase muscle strength by putting more strain on a muscle than it is normally accustomed to receiving this increased load stimulates the growth of proteins inside each muscle cell that allow the muscle as a whole to contract there is evidenceindicating that strength training may be better than aerobic exercise alone for improving selfesteemand body image weight training allows one immediate feedback through observation of progress in muscle growth and improved muscle tone strengthening exercise can take the form of isometricisotonic and isokinetic strengthening isometric exercise during isometric exercises muscles contract however there is no motion in the affected joints the muscle fibers maintain a constant length throughout the entire contraction the exercisesusually are performed against an immovable surface or object such as pressing ones hand against a wall the muscles of the arm are contracting but the wall is not reacting or moving in response to the physical effort isometric training is effective for developing total strength of a particular muscle or group of muscles it often is used for rehabilitation since the exact area of muscle weakness can be isolated and strengthening can be administered at the proper joint angle this kind of training canprovide a relatively quick and convenient method for overloading and strengthening muscles withoutany special equipment and with little chance of injury isotonic exercise isotonic exercise differs from isometric exercise in that there is movement of a joint during themuscle contraction a classic example of an isotonic exercise is weight training with dumbbells andbarbells as the weight is lifted throughout the range of motion the muscle shortens and lengthens calisthenics are also an example of isotonic exercise these would include chinups pushups andsitups all of which use body weight as the resistance force isokinetic exercise isokinetic exercise utilizes machines that control the speed of contraction within the range of motion isokinetic exercise attempts to combine the best features of both isometrics and weighttraining it provides muscular overload at a constant preset speed while a muscle mobilizes its forcethrough the full range of motion for example an isokinetic stationary bicycle set at 90 revolutionsper minute means that no matter how hard and fast the exerciser works the isokinetic properties of the bicycle will allow the exerciser to pedal only as fast as 90 revolutions per minute machinesknown as cybex and biodex provide isokinetic results they generally are used by physicaltherapists cardiac rehabilitation exercise can be very helpful in prevention and rehabilitation of cardiac disorders and disease with an exercise program designed at a level considered safe for the individual people with symptoms of heart failure can substantially improve their fitness levels the greatest benefit occurs as musclesimprove the efficiency of their oxygen use which reduces the need for the heart to pump as muchblood while such exercise does not necessarily improve the condition of the heart itself theincreased fitness level reduces the total workload of the heart the related increase in endurancealso should translate into a generally more active lifestyle endurance or aerobic routines such as running brisk walking cycling or swimming increase the strength and efficiency of the muscles of the heart preparation a physical examination by a physician is important to determine if strenuous exercise is appropriate or detrimental for an individual especially when the exercise program is designed for rehabilitation before exercising proper stretching is important to prevent the possibility of soft tissue injuryresulting from tight muscles tendons ligaments and other jointrelated structures aftercare proper cool down after exercise is important in reducing the occurrence of painful muscle spasms proper cool down stretching also may decrease frequency and intensity of muscle stiffness the dayfollowing any exercise program risks improper warm up can lead to muscle strains overexertion without enough time between exercisesessions to recuperate also can lead to muscle strains resulting in inactivity due to pain stressfractures also are a possibility if activities are strenuous over long periods without proper rest although exercise is safe for the majority of children and adults there is still a need for furtherstudies to identify potential risks normal results significant health benefits are obtained by including a moderate amount of physical exercise in theform of an exercise prescription this is much like a drug prescription in that it also helps enhancethe health of those who take it in the proper dosage physical activity plays a positive role in preventing disease and improving overall health status people of all ages both male and femalebenefit from regular physical activity regular exercise also provides significant psychologicalbenefits and improves quality of life abnormal results exercise burnout may occur if an exercise program is not varied and adequate rest periods are nottaken between exercise sessions muscle joint and cardiac disorders have been noted amongpeople who exercise however they often have had preexisting or underlying illnesses key terms aerobic exercise training that is geared to

circulatory response to physical stress it involvescontinuous electrocardiographic monitoring during physical exercise the objective being to increase the intensity of physical exertion until a target heart rate is reached or signs andsymptoms of cardiac ischemia appear called also stress testing ƒ clinical exercise testing has become an important tool in screening for and diagnosing earlyischemic heart disease that cannot be detected by a standard resting ekg and in predicting theprobability of the development of the condition in later years the technique cannot determine thelocation of the lesion causing cardiac ischemia and therefore must be supplemented withangiocardiography when coronary occlusion is detected common forms of exercise used include the treadmill and the bicycle ergometer theseprocedures must be performed in a clinical setting where health care personnel are available in the event symptoms develop during exercise such as dyspnea vertigo extreme fatigue severearrhythmias or other abnormal ekg readings exercise testing also may be used to assess the pulmonary status of a patient with a respiratorydisease as the patient performs specific exercises

movement to restore normal function in diseased or injured tissues or to maintain a state of wellbeing called also corrective exercise as with any type of therapy a therapeutic exercise program is designed to correct specificdisabilities of the individual patient the program is evaluated periodically and modified as indicated by the patients progress and response to the prescribed regimen exercises affect thebody locally and systemically and bring about changes in the nervous circulatory and endocrinesystems as well as the musculoskeletal systemƒamong the types of therapeutic exercise are those that 1 increase or maintain mobility of thejoints and surrounding soft tissues 2 develop coordination through control of individual muscles 3 increase muscular strength and endurance and 4 promote relaxation and relief of tension joint mobility in the absence of a disability that prohibits mobility the regular daytodayactivities of living maintain the normal movements of the joints if however motion is restricted for any reason the soft tissues become dense and hard and adaptive shortening of the connective tissues takes place these changes begin to develop within four days after a joint has been immobilized and are evident even in a normal joint that has been renderedimmobile it is for this reason that therapeutic exercises to prevent loss of joint motion are so important and should be begun as soon as possible after an injury has occurred or a diseaseprocess has begunƒprevention of the loss of joint motion is much less costly and timeconsuming than correction of tissue changes that seriously impair joint mobility it is recommended that each jointshould be put through its full range of motion three times at least twice daily if the patient is not able to carry out these exercises he is assisted by a therapist or member of the familywho has been instructed in the exercises inflammation of the joint as in arthritis may causesome pain on motion and so passive exercises are done slowly and gently with the joint as relaxed as possible procedures that stretch tight muscles to increase joint motion should be done only by a skilled therapist who understands the hazards of fracture and bleeding withinthe joint which can occur if the exercises are done improperly or too strenuously muscle training exercises of this type are taught to the patient who has lost some controlover a major skeletal muscle by learning precise and conscious control over a specificmuscle the patient is able to strengthen and coordinate its movement with normal motorpatterns and thus enhance mobility muscle training or neuromuscular reeducation demandsfull cooperation of the patient who must be capable of understanding the purpose of theexercises following directions and giving full attention to the muscle isolated for retraining the sessions are held in a quiet comfortable atmosphere to facilitate concentration by thepatientƒthe development of conscious control over individual muscles is useful in the rehabilitation of patients with a variety of disorders including physical trauma diseases such as poliomyelitisthat affect the motor neurons and congenital disorders such as cerebral palsy it involves a systematic program of sequential activities under the direction of a therapist knowledgeable in the technique although it requires much effort on the part of the patient and the therapist theattainment of muscle control and coordination is a satisfying reward muscle strength and endurance improvement of muscle strength and endurance is particularly important in the rehabilitation of patients whose goal is to return to an active andproductive life after a debilitating illness or disabling injury the exercises are prescribedaccording to the individual needs of the patient and usually involve more than one group of musclesƒstrengthening force increasing exercises are prescribed after an examination has shownweakness in individual muscles or muscle groups these exercises are usually administeredwith relatively high resistance and few 3 to 10 repetitions a group of exercises called a set is followed by a few minutes of rest three to 5 sets for a muscle or group constitute one bout of exercises strengthening exercises are often performed daily in early stages of rehabilitation but less often later in treatment endurance exercises stimulate changes in the involved muscle or muscles resulting in improved capacity for repeated contraction eg increased ability to use metabolites whenconducted over a sufficient length of time and with several muscle groups they may alsoproduce central effects of the cardiovascular system see cardiovascular exercise  endurance exercises employ relatively low resistance and numerous 15 or more repetitions endurance exercises are generally administered daily relief of tension exercises that promote relaxation of the muscles and provide relief fromthe effects of tension are useful in a wide variety of disorders ranging from mild tensionheadache to insomnia patients who are especially tense may require several sessions of instruction in relaxation before they can learn the technique

incorporate different routines and exercises into my workouts and would like yourassistance a i do 60 pushups60 situps and run 2 miles in 15 mins then lift weightsmy whole work outlasts about an hour a day q how much exercise should i do i am very fond of exercise but i get tired soon and loosing my energy how much exercise should i do a i am glad that you are fond of something which is vital for healthy living experts recommend3060 minutes of exercise per day the 60minute suggestion is based on the national academy of sciences ideal recommendation for people who are trying to lose weight but youll get realhealth benefits and burn lots of calories even if you dont work out that much especially if youhavent been exercising at all up to now while 30 minutes of physical activity is consideredenough to lower your risk of heart disease stroke and high blood pressure even 10 minutes a day will do you good remember that you dont have to do all your exercise in one session a 30minute aerobics workout in the morning a 20minute walk after work and 10 minutes of mopping the floor after dinner can do the trick dont forget to include some strength training andstretching in your workouts tooq how do you motivate yourself to exercise i have a problem i can easily get myself to go to work and other strenuous things but when i need to get myself out for some exercise which is onlyfor me i don’t find the energy for that does anyone have any tips how to encourage myself a try to change to an exercise you enjoy you can also exercise with a friend and thecommitment to him may
