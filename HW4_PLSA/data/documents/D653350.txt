how to cook lamb chopsprint recipe card posted in main dishes by kathy maister difficultyprevious  next i like to cook lamb chops quickly in a frying pan on high heat only seven minutes later dinner’s readythere are many different cuts of lamb available these rib chops are have their own little “handle” which makes them perfect for picking up and eating with your fingers the nugget of meat in the center will be juicy and tender as long as it is not cooked past “medium”a ¾ inch thick chop is the optimum size to buy thinner chops tend to get overcooked very easily figure on 23 chops per person start by sprinkling some salt and pepper on both sides of each lamb chop preheat your nonstick pan on high heat to tell if the pan is hot enough add about 1 tablespoon of water to the pan the water should sizzle and evaporate immediately add the chops to the fry pan you should hear them sizzle if they are not sizzling then your pan is not hot enough set the timer to 3 ½ minutes to 4 minutes when the timer goes off flip the lamb chops using a pair of tongs continuing cooking on the flip side for another 3 ½ to 4 minutes mint sauce is traditional with lamb chops some people prefer mint jelly you get to choose if you are feeling adventurous you might want to give cooking a leg of lamb a tryenjoyp s all of my recommendations and cooking times are based on meat taken directly from the refrigerator according to joy of cooking in their “meat” section they say and i agree “while many cookbooks and food experts recommend bringing meat to room temperature before cooking we encourage you to follow the safer practice of keeping meat refrigerated right up to the last minute before cooking while roomtemperature meat will cook more quickly there is not enough benefit to outweigh the risks of tempting bacteria even for a short time”you can view and print this recipe here if you are new to startcooking or are a regular visitor here please consider subscribing for freesubscribe 49 comments jon said i’m a fan of lamb but sometimes find it a bit ‘fatty’ whcih is why i prefer to cook it under the grill broiler so the fat drains off also if you cook it that way the you can baste it as it cooks – my favourite is a mix of olive oil fresh chopped rosemary a great herb to have with lamb and garlic cook the lamb for 12 minutes baste the chop cook for another minute or so turn baste and cook for 34 minutes – yum in my view lamb has to be served a little pink but cooked tis way it is so tender and juicy graydon said sounds good… i’d like to have seen one cut open to get a feel for the doneness you’d get after 3 12 minutes also do you let your meat sit out for any amount of time or straight from fridge kathy maister said hi graydon you are so right i should have sliced open one of the lamb chops they were our dinner for that evening and i didnâ€™t want them to get too cold they were pink on the inside i like them medium my husband likes his chops more mediumrare i usually cook his about 2 ½ minutes on each side i did take them directly from the refrigerator where they were very cold indeed they sat on the counter only for a few minutes while i seasoned them and preheated the pan jon i’m going to give the broiler a try next time thanks for the tipjon said for your info most recipies in cook books are based on cooking meat from room temperature rather than from the fridge i have to admit that i find lamb which is beyond pink overly dry and think you lose some of the flavour – though in my experince here in the uk we tend to like our meat far rarer than in the us i have found in the past that to get meat even near what i would call medium rare that when i’m in the us i have to ask for rare – and then get some very funny looks…kathy maister said hmmm i guess thatâ€™s why a lot of steak houses give detailed descriptions of what rare mediumrare etc actually looks likejoy of cooking is my cooking bible in their â€œmeatâ€ section they say and i agree â€œwhile many cookbooks and food experts recommend bringing meat to room temperature before cooking we encourage you to follow the safer practice of keeping meat refrigerated right up to the last

cooking times are based on meat taken directly from the refrigeratormatthew said i prefer to panfry broiling was way too hot and the marinade i used started a small grease fire scary and not worth it tastes great off a pan kathy maister said i agree with you matthew pan fried lamb chops cook up in no time and are deliciousjason said when i pan fry lamb chops i like to add a small combination of red wine olive oil rosemary and dill to the mix for me it adds for a rich full flavor that complements the strong lamb meat flavor kathy maister said jason that sounds delicious do you use fresh or dried rosemary and dilcidnee saidhi this is one of the most famos chef’s daughter here and when my dad made them lamb chops i loved them i thought i would not like the lamb chops but i was wronge i

pink and delicious thanks so much for responding to my post kathy maister said dmsee i’m delighted they turned out welli’m not sure i understand when you say “10 minutes on each side” are you closing
