nineveh the oldest and mostpopulous city of the ancient assyrian empire situated on the east bank of the tigris river and encircled by the modern city of mosul iraq nineveh was located at the intersection of important northsouth and eastwest trade routes and its proximity to a tributary of the tigris the khawṣar river added to the value of the fertile agricultural and pastoral lands in the district nineveh nergal gate the partially reconstructed nergal gate in nineveh iraq staff sgt jo ann s makinanou s air force the first person to survey and map nineveh was the archaeologist claudius j rich in 1820 a work later completed by felix jones and published by him in 1854 excavations have been undertaken intermittently since that period by many persons a h later sir henry layard during 1845–51 discovered the palace of sennacherib and took back to england an unrivalled collection of stone basreliefs together with thousands of tablets inscribed in cuneiform from the great library of ashurbanipal hormuzd rassam continued the work in 1852 during 1929–32 r campbell thompson excavated the temple of nabu nebo on behalf of the british museum and discovered the site of the palace of ashurnasirpal ii in 1931–32 together with m e l later sir max mallowan thompson for the first time dug a shaft from the top of the quyunjik acropolis 90 feet 30 metres above the level of the plain down through strata of accumulated debris of earlier cultures to virgin soil it was then proved that more than fourfifths of this great accumulation is prehistoric history the first settlement a small neolithic new stone age hamlet was probably founded not later than the 7th millennium bce hassunasāmarrāʾ and tall ḥalaf painted pottery of the subsequent early chalcolithic copperstone age phases characteristic of the north was succeeded by gray wares such as occur westward in the jabal sinjār farmers during the 4th millennium used clay sickles of a type found in the ubaid period  see tall alʿubayd  and these imply contact with the south one of the mostremarkable discoveries that mallowan and thompson made in the prehistoric strata consisted of roughly made bevelled bowls overturned in the soil and filled with vegetable matter these may have been intended as magical offerings to expel evil spirits from houses their typology conforms exactly with that of uruk  erech pottery widespread throughout the tigris–euphrates valley in the late 4th millennium in these levels also large metal vases occur again characteristic of southern babylonia and technologically this district of the tigris had much in common with the cities of the lower euphrates valley at this period this similarity is of particular interest because it indicates that sometime before 3000 bce a period of economic prosperity had united the commercial interests of north and south later these two civilizations diverged widely a little before and after 3000 bce unpainted ninevite pottery was similar to that used at sumerian sites to approximately the same period belongs a series of attractively painted and incised ware known as ninevite v which is a home product distinct from that of the south beads found in these strata may be dated c 2900 bce the mostremarkable object of the 3rd millennium bce is a realistic bronze head—lifesize cast and chased—of a bearded monarch now in the iraq museum baghdad this the finest piece of metal sculpture ever recovered from mesopotamia may represent the famous king sargon of akkad  c 2334– c 2279 bce  however because of its brilliant technique and elaborately modelled features it is thought by some authorities to belong to a rather later stage of the akkadian period  c 2334– c 2154 bce  if so the head might represent king naramsin  c 2254– c 2218 bce  the hypothesis for the earlier period seems preferable for metalwork advanced more rapidly in style in mesopotamia at that period than did stone sculpture and it is known from inscriptions that sargon’s second son manishtusu had built the temple of emashmash at nineveh by virtue of being the “son of sargon” thus a model of the founder of the dynasty would have been appropriately placed

all extensively in nineveh during the 2nd millennium bce later monarchs whose inscriptions have appeared on the acropolis include shalmaneser i and tiglathpileser i both of whom were active builders in ashur the former had founded calah nimrūd nineveh had to wait for the neoassyrians particularly from the time of ashurnasirpal ii ruled 883–859 bce onward for a considerable architectural expansion thereafter successive monarchs kept in repair and founded new palaces temples to sin nergal nanna shamash ishtar and nabu nebo unfortunately severe depredations have left few remains of these edifices it was sennacherib who made nineveh a truly magnificent city  c 700 bce  he laid out fresh streets and squares and built within it the famous “palace without a rival” the plan of which has been mostly recovered and has overall dimensions of about 600 by 630 feet 180 by 190 metres it comprised at least 80 rooms of which many were lined with sculpture a large part of the famous “k” collection of tablets was found there see below some of the principal doorways were flanked by humanheaded bulls at this time the total area of nineveh comprised about 1800 acres 700 hectares and 15 great gates penetrated its walls an elaborate system of 18 canals brought water from the hills to nineveh and several sections of a magnificently constructed aqueduct erected by the same monarch were discovered at jerwan about 25 miles 40 km distant sennacherib leading a military campaign detail of a relief from nineveh c 690 bce in the british museum reproduced by courtesy of the trustees of the british museum his successor esarhaddon built an arsenal in the nabī yūnus mound south of quyunjik and either he or his successor set up statues of the pharaoh taharqa tarku at its entrance as trophies to celebrate the conquest of egypt these were discovered by fuad safar and muḥammad ʿalī muṣṭafā on behalf of the iraqi department of antiquities in 1954 ashurbanipal later in the 7th century bce constructed a new palace at the northwest end of the acropolis he also founded the great library and ordered his scribes to collect and copy ancient texts throughout the country the “k” collection included more than 20000 tablets or fragments of tablets and incorporated the ancient lore of mesopotamia the subjects are literary religious and administrative and a great many tablets are in the form of letters branches of learning represented include mathematics botany chemistry and lexicology the library contains a mass of information about the ancient world and will exercise scholars for generations to come fourteen years after the death of ashurbanipal however nineveh suffered a defeat from which it never recovered extensive traces of ash representing the sack of the city by babylonians scythians and medes in 612 bce have been found in many parts of the acropolis after 612 bce the city ceased to be important although there are some seleucid and greek remains xenophon in the anabasis recorded the name of the city as mespila in the 13th century ce the city seems to have enjoyed some prosperity under the atabegs of mosul subsequently houses continued to be inhabited at least as late as the 16th century ce in these later levels imitations of chinese wares have been found outline of the city from the ruins it has been established that the perimeter of the great assyrian city wall was about 75 miles 12 km long and in places up to 148 feet 45 metres wide there was also a great unfinished outer rampart protected by a moat and the khawṣar river flowed through the centre of the city to join the tigris on the western side of it the 15 great gates that intersected the acropolis walls were built partly of mud brick and partly of stone the long eastern sector about 3 miles 5 km contained six gates the southern sector 2624 feet 800 metres contained only one the ashur gate the western sector about 25 miles 4 km had five gates the northern sector about 12 miles 19 km three gates adad nergal and sin several of these entrances are known to have been faced with stone colossi lamassu in the nergal gate two winged stone bulls attributable to sennacherib have been reinstalled a site museum has been erected adjacent to it by the iraqi department of antiquities the adad gate contained many inscribed tiles and what may prove to be the sin gate contained a corridor that led through an arched doorway into a ramp or stairwell giving access to the battlements most impressive was the shamash gate which has been thoroughly excavated by tariq madhloum on behalf of the iraqi department of antiquities it was found to have been approached across two moats and a watercourse by a series of bridges in which the arches were cut out of the natural conglomerate the wall was faced with limestone and surmounted by a crenellated parapet behind which ran a defense causeway the structure was constructed of mud as well as burnt bricks which bore the stamp of sennacherib there was an entrance 148 feet 45 metres wide in the centre of a long projecting bastion which was further strengthened by six towers crudely incised stone slabs on the inner side of the gateway depicted the burning of a tower it is possible that these carvings represented the fall of nineveh and are postassyrian the internal plan of the gate includes six great chambers lined with uncarved orthostats upright slabs which were discovered by layard and rassam archaeologists also have been active within the quyunjik acropolis since 1966 restoration has proceeded on the throne room of sennacherib’s palace and some of the adjoining chambers all the entrances to the two main chambers were found flanked by winged bull colossi and a series of orthostats not recorded by any of the 19thcentury excavators has been recovered one such slab illustrates a foreign city heavily defended by towers surrendering to the assyrian army adjoining the throne room is a stonepaved bathroom and the great antehall contained no fewer than 40 carved orthostats the subjects represented include sennacherib’s campaigns against mountaindwelling peoples besieged cities and units of the assyrian army max mallowan
