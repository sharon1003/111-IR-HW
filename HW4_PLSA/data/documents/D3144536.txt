20180410  0804 sp the dependence and freedom of kafkas metamorphosisby elizabeth mc carty one of franz kafkas most wellknown and most often criticized works is the short story die verwandlung or the metamorphosis the metamorphosis is most unusual in that the first sentence is the climax the rest of the story is mainly falling action greenburg 273 the reader learns that gregor samsa the storys main character has been turned into an enormous insect despite this fact gregor continues to act and think like any normal human would which makes the beginning of the story both tragic and comical at the same time however one cannot help but wonder why gregor has undergone this hideous transformation and what purpose it could possibly serve in the story upon examination it seems that gregors metamorphosis represents both his freedom from maintaining his entire financial stability and his familys freedom from their dependence upon gregor long before the story takes place gregor samsas father had a business failure that left him deep in debt his son gregor works as a commercial traveler for the company to whom he owes money in effect gregor is slowly working off his fathers debt gregor is not happy with his job which greenburg calls degrading and souldestroying but believes that his familys existence depends upon him sacrificing himself by working at this meaningless job and so he continues 274 heinz politzer goes far enough to say that gregor is a slave to his boss 276 which would imply that there is no escape for gregor at least no conventional escape however gregor does escape from his life of indentured servancy by becoming a giant insect walter h sokel explains the effect of the metamorphosis on his occupational position the metamorphosis has intervened and made work impossible it accomplishes as we can see in part at least the goal of gregors longedfor rebellion it sets him free of his odious job at the same time it relieves him of having to make a choice between his responsibility to his parents and his yearning to be free the metamorphosis enables gregor to become free and stay innocent a mere victim of uncontrollably calamity 265 here sokel states that gregor through his transformation has solved his biggest problem the company does not accept illness so he could not escape work by feigning or truly being stricken with sickness taking on his current bug form is the only real way to completely free himself from his job in effect gregor makes a deal with the devil he is released of his servitude and family responsibility guilt free but must live out his remaining days as a giant insect freud stated that there were no accidents but simply acts springing from unconscious motives if this is true then gregors metamorphosis could be considered his selfpunishment and guilt for wanting to quit his job 265266 this metamorphosis also marks gregors freedom as an individual throughout his entire life he has let other people make his decisions for him greenburg 274 this is the first occurrence in his life over which no one including he had any control this metamorphosis allows his hidden self to emerge the self that had been stifled for so many years friedman 270 gregor is no longer the head of the household or the working man but a creature representing his true personality parry 263 gregor was never really alive as the head of the house even if he had eventually paid off his familys debt by that time his life would have been wasted friedman 272 but in actuality gregors death comes not as a human but as an insect when the family he once support and came to rely upon completely neglects him parry 264 however there is more than one point of view represented in this story gregors family also plays a key role and is not entirely antagonistic kafka shows not only a metamorphosis in gregor but also in his mother father and sister as well at first gregors metamorphosis brings out hate and fear in his family despite everything he has done to help them landsberg 259 however as the family adjusts to gregors metamorphosis they adjust their lives accordingly they had grown lethargic depending upon gregor but now they must learn to once again take care of themselves the family gradually becomes independent of gregor unfortunately for this to happen gregor had to become a hideous insect kafka knew that the family had to want its independence from gregor but still be guiltless in attaining it the only way to make this work was to make gregor repulsive to them friedman 27071 as the samsas become more independent they neglect gregor more and more as he begins to deteriorate and die the more independent they become the more anxious they are to get rid of him friedman 270 mr samsa once completely dependent on his son for all financial support was brought back to life he raises his stature once again to reclaim his spot as the man of the house while gregor withers and dies parry 264 just as the family becomes completely independent and decides that gregor is more of a nuisance than they can continue to endure gregor dies friedman observed that this is because gregor had to be sacrificed for their rebirth 271 it is as though there was a balance of dependence in the house before gregors transformation he was the bread winner but still dependant on his family for several things such as shelter and love however after the transformation gregors family becomes completely independent since they need nothing from gregor or he has nothing to offer them since finally he serves no purpose it is only fitting that he peacefully pass away to leave his family their newfound freedom consequently gregors transformation was much more than just a physical transformation it was a means of liberation for both gregor and his family since gregor was a bug he was no longer able to work thereby freeing himself from the bondage of his fathers debt since gregor could not work his family had to get jobs thereby freeing themselves of their dependence on gregor kafka magically makes a completely unrealistic tale realistic making the reader abandon all defenses and become engrossed in this tale the characters become real people with real problem and the readers concerns for them extends far beyond the bittersweet ending of the story gregors metamorphosis was necessary for his freedom as his death was necessary for the familys freedom gregor may have passed on at the end but the last line of the story and it was like a confirmation of their new dreams and excellent intentions that at the end of their journey their daughter sprang to her feet and stretched her young body di yanni 213 give us hope for the rest of the samsa family and for their future as they return home revision
