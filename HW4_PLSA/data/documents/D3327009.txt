union was a coalition of german states formed to manage customs and economic policies within their territories established in 1818 the original union cemented economic ties between the various prussian and hohenzollern territories and ensured economic contact between the noncontiguous holdings of the hohenzollern family which was also the ruling family of prussia it expanded between 1820 to 1866 to include most of the german states austria was excluded because of its highly protected industry this economic exclusion exacerbated the austroprussian rivalry for dominance in central europe particularly in the 1850s and 1860s with the founding of the north german confederation in 1867 the zollverein included approximately 425000 square kilometres and had produced economic agreements with nongerman states like sweden and luxembourg historians have seen three prussian goals as a political tool to eliminate austrian influence in germany as a way to improve the economies and to strengthen germany against potential french aggression while reducing the economic independence of smaller states  1 the customs union created a larger market for germanmade farm and handicraft products and promoted commercial unification under fiscally sound economic parameters while the union sought to limit trade and commercial barriers between and among member states it continued to uphold the protectionist barriers with outsiders the political strength of the customs union lay with the prussians whose promotion of the little germany solution of national political unification mirrored the customs unions economic solution after the founding of the german empire in 1871 the empire assumed the control of the union although not a state in the german reich luxembourg belonged to the union

how a multitude of small territories was transformed around 1800 into several middle large powers baden württemberg and bavaria the splintering of territory and states over generations meant that by the 1790s in the germanspeaking holy roman empire in central europe there were approximately 1800 customs barriers even within the prussian state itself there were at the beginning of the 19th century over 67 local customs and tariffs with as many customs borders to travel from königsberg in east prussia to cologne for example a shipment was inspected and taxed 18 times  2 each customs inspection at each border slowed the shipments progress from source to destination and each assessment on the shipment reduced profit and increased the price of goods dramatically stifling trade when france defeated the second coalition made up of russian austrian and german forces and annexed territories up to the rhine there was a general consolidation of the myriad of tiny states in germany in the mediatization of 1803 also called principal conclusion of the extraordinary imperial delegation or in german hauptschluss der außerordentlichen reichsdeputation usually called the reichsdeputationshauptschluss  this last piece of major legislation enacted by the holy roman empire rearranged the map of central europe especially in the southwestern territories the reichshauptschluss resulted in the secularization of many ecclesiastical territories and the socalled mediatization ie the annexation to larger neighboring territories of many of the formerly free imperial territories including most of the imperial cities considerable portions of the habsburg family territories in southwestern central europe were mediatized or given as compensation to the princes and dukes who had themselves lost territories in the french expansion most of the imperial cities imperial abbies and ecclesiastical states and cities were mediatized or secularized in 1803 with the final dissolution of the holy roman empire in 1806 most of the remaining tiny principalities were annexed by larger neighbors zollverein was a custom union that was formed in 1834 at the initiative of prussia and was joined by most of the german states it was formed to remove the various obstacles such as different weights and measures in german states to economic exchange and growth by the new commercial classes it created a national unity in economic matter at a time when germany was divided it accustomed german states to cooperate with austria who had not become a member of zollverein initial efforts at a single toll system during the napoleonic era efforts toward economic unity in the rhineland had mixed success the confederation of the rhine and the other satellite creations of napoleonic france sought to establish economic autonomy in european trade by 1806 as napoleon i sought to secure his hegemony in europe the continental system offered a semblance of unified effort toward a widespread domestic market for european goods however the main purpose of the continental system was military not economic napoleon wanted a trade embargo against britain through which he hoped to wreck the british economy the combination of war and isolation from britains trading system destroyed markets for external raw materials and for manufactured goods and resulted in the near ruin of the central european economy especially hard hit were the trading economies of the lowlands and rhineland states which had relied heavily upon imports of raw materials from throughout the world and on the ability to export finished products the domestic markets in central europe were not large enough to sustain consumption of their own production and these problems were dramatically exacerbated by the excise taxes and tolls which were the main source of state income reduction in trade meant the near bankruptcy of the smaller states  3at the congress of vienna in 18141815 diplomats principally those from the great powers confirmed the remapping of europe and broadly the rest of the world into spheres of influence central europe or german speaking europe remained largely within the influence of the austrian habsburgs balanced at the periphery by the russian empire in the east and the french in the west it was expected that prussia would also play some role in these spheres of influence but the ambiguities of the austrian and prussian relationship were unresolved the german states themselves remained autonomous however the old imperial institution of the reichstag was reinvented in the form of a confederation diet that would meet in frankfurt the habsburg dukes now kings of austria were to serve as permanent presidents of this institution isolated voices such as those of joseph görres and freiherr vom stein called for the abolition of domestic tolls and the creation of a german tariff on imports  4 the mandate from the vienna congress however established the german confederation but did not deal with the economic circumstances nor did it make any effort to achieve economic and trade standardization instead the articles that established the conferation simply suggested that trade and transportation questions be discussed at a later date  5problems with unifying the customs and toll agreements in prussia and in the south and central western states of hessenassau and hessedarmstadt württemberg baden and bavaria were leaders in the modernization of the toll system within the german states in the prussian case the experience of the confederation of the rhine in removing customs barriers offered an example of how it could be done and hans count von bülow who until 1811 had been the finance minister in westphalia and who had accepted this position in 1813 in prussia modeled the prussian customs statutes on those of the former states of the confederation the addition of territory to the existing prussian state made elimination of customs barriers a powerful factor in prussian politics the significant differences between old prussia and the newly acquired territories complicated the debate the newer prussian provinces in the rhineland and westphalia with their developing manufacturing sectors contended with the heavily agricultural territories of old prussia the dissimilarities in the two sides of prussia confirmed regional perceptions for the need for their own political and administrative units which became an important element of the customs debate within old prussia itself the customs statutes from 1818 reduced domestic customs barriers after 1818 goods coming into prussia and leaving prussia were charged a high tariff goods moved freely within the state itself the prussian toll was therefore very simple and efficient manufactured goods were heavily taxed especially textiles and the most important taxes were for food necessities and luxury goods similarly in the southwest german states it became urgent to integrate the newly acquired territories into the states existing economic systems  6 the territorial growth of the southwestern middlesized states in particular the two hessian principalities but also the growth of baden and württemberg had split the territorial continuity of prussia the prussian state was no longer linked entirely by territory but rather was separated from many of its newer acquisitions by territories newly acquired by other states these states often saw their own interests as conflicting generally and specifically with prussian expansionism and resented prussian dominance and authority furthermore these newly expanded states usually referred as middlesized states or in german mittelstaaten  faced problems in integrating their newly acquired territories and populations into an existing political economic and legal structure a further problem was caused by international interference in the discussions due to vested interests in particular the british empire was seen to play a role in disrupting attempts to establish a prussian customs union british diplomats particularly envoy edward james nottingham who wished to secure the continuation of their existing trade agreements saw the development of a customs union as a threat to the economic status quo motivated by a desire to secure the import of ruhr iron at favourable rates a number of diplomats began petitioning for a general strike on the grounds that german managers were quaffing dortmund beer by the gallon whilst ruhr workers toiled merely a cog in the machine of the industrial revolution  7 no general strike was called these problems were exacerbated by european wide economic woes following the napoleonic wars unemployment high prices especially for foodstuffs characterized an economy not yet converted back to peacetime needs the problem in britain was particularly severe and the british response created a ripple effect that worsened problems in the german states in trying to manage the postwar economy the british government was caught between the malthusian understanding of the relationship of wages prices and population and the ricardian model on the one hand adherents to the malthusian model believed it was dangerous for britain to rely on imported corn because lower prices would reduce labor’s wages and landlords and farmers would lose purchasing power  8 on the other hand adherents to the ricardian model thought that britain could use its capital and population to advantage in a system of free trade  9 the problems in britain established precedent for problems in the german states the british limitation on grain imports through the 1815 corn grain law blocked economic recovery in the german states particularly in eastern prussia by limiting the amount of grain that could be imported into britain not only did the corn laws keep the price of grain in britain high it undermined the viability of junker producers in east prussia and limited their access to external markets the commercial reform efforts sponsored by bavaria in 1856 led to the general german commercial code in 1861 that was quickly approved by a majority of the confederation it proved highly successful in reducing barriers and increasing trade the customs union 1820s and 1830s friedrich list economist oil painting by caroline hövemeyer 1839 heimatmuseum reutlingen johann friedrich cotta played an important role in the development of the south german customs agreement and negotiated the prussian hessian customs agreements lithograph around 1830surmounting the domestic customs and the individual states dependence on those customs as their primary source of income proved to be a difficult problem the myriad of customs barriers restricted trade and hampered the industrial development but the rulers of the states were reluctant to forgo their income from the customs the impasse was overcome through external forces with the repeal of the continental system the german tradesmen stood in direct conflict with the english industry a united german trade and tradesmens union demanded protection from english exports their spokesman the economist friedrich list feared that the german people would end up as drawers of water and hewers of wood for britain  10 similarly karl friedrich nebenius later president of the ducal ministry in the grand duchy of baden and the author of badens 1819 proposed customs initiative with the german confederation offered a widely publicized description about the difficulties of surmounting such protections the 830 toll barriers in germany cripple domestic traffic and bring more or less the same results how if every limb of the human body were bound together so that blood could not flow from one limb to the other in order to trade from hamburg to austria from berlin to the swiss cantons one must cut through the statutes of ten states study ten tolls and toll barriers ten times go through the toll barriers and ten times pay the tolls who but the unfortunate has to negotiate such borders to live with such borders where three or four states collide there one must live his whole life under evil senseless tolls and toll restrictions that is no fatherland  11in 1820 württemberg planned to start a customs union among the so called third germany the middle sized german states including itself baden bavaria and the two hessian states this customs union excluded both austria and prussia primarily because the two major german powers were considered too overbearing plans foundered on the differing interests of the affected states while the economic development in baden proceeded relatively well with its long borders and well entrenched infrastructure for trade economic development in bavaria lagged well behind it and the bavarian regime enacted a protective tariff on goods produced outside its border the result was a short lived trade agreement between baden and hessendarmstadt nevertheless a second agreement reached in stuttgart in 1825 established rapport between württemberg and bavaria with the foundation of the south german customs union in opposition to the prussian activities hannover saxony hesse and other states austria france great britain and the netherlands developed their own economic agreements while they promised one another not to join the prussian union they did develop trade agreements of their own the union remained unsuccessful because it only sought to maintain the status quo not to fix the problems created by toll barriers  12 in 1834 baden and württemberg joined the prussian union which was renamed the german customs union by 1835 the german customs union had expanded to include the majority of the states of the german confederation even saxony thuringia württemberg and baden bavaria and the hessen states functionally it removed many internal customs barriers while upholding a protectionist tariff system

zollverein in retrospect did much more than simply cement alliances between the various german states as its prussian architects had intended it set the groundwork for the unification of germany under prussian dominance achieved less than five decades later some economic historians such as helmut böhme use the zollverein to dispute the general view of otto von bismarck as the unifier of germany insisting that the economic dominance of prussia made unification inevitable as it led invariably to military dominance and thus political primacy secondly these historians argue the zollverein established an antiaustrian tradition among the prussians by this argument bismarck cannot be said to have revolutionized prussian politics since the zollverein is evidence of an antiaustrian flow of
