opening narration the ateam is one of the most famous of the 1980s action series running from 1983 to 1987 the four members of the ateam are colonel john hannibal smith — played by george peppard he is the leader of the team a cunning master of disguise captain h m howlin mad murdock — played by dwight schultz he is the resident pilot who may or may not be insane lieutenant templeton faceman peck — played by dirk benedict he is the charmer of the team sergeant bosco b a bad attitude baracus — played by mr t he is the teams strongman with a famous fear of flying each episode would start with a bunch of innocent people being menaced by a bunch of people with guns who want their land water taxi company etc they would go talk to a man who they thought would get them in contact with the ateam most of the time it would turn out to be a member of the ateam — hannibal in disguise who had to make sure the people in question are not part of a trap to capture the team they would go along to the location of the activity in their cool car which in their case was actually a distinctivelooking custom van — an odd choice for a group who are supposed to be in hiding there they would do a lot of ateam firing beat up the baddies and often mac gyver up an armored vehicle over the course of an ateam montage the show ran for five seasons with several minor cast changes along the way the shows eventual decline was attributed to the constantlyrecycled and extremely formulaic plot attempts to win viewers back by both changing the overall premise and having the ateam overseen by a former antagonist worked for only a short while logic and credibility were usually ignored for the series trademark overthetop explosions but the show never took itself particularly seriously anyway most of hannibals disguises were paperthin the villains were usually mostlyinept and somewhat onedimensional and the weapons that the team cobbled together from miscellaneous parts were invariably more effective than the machine guns that the episodes villains used a bigscreen version was released in june 2010 with liam neeson bradley cooper sharlto copley and quinton jackson as the team the trailer can be seen on you tube tropes go to the respective page the ateam provides examples of the following tropes abandoned war child the sound of thunder has the team hired by seasonlong adversary general fullbright who learned he has a child from the vietnam war accent adaptation one episode has the gang supposedly going to barcelona spain to foil a plane hijacking by unspecified terrorists without a cause their plan includes murdock infiltrating the plane by posing as a spanish copilot so he speaks english with a spanish accent and throws a lot of gratuitous spanish in the spanish dub murdock speaks in this scene with a catalan accent which is both unexpected and hilarious ace pilot murdock if it has wings he can fly it and he might even be able to land it safelyaction film quiet drama scene believe it or not the series had a few of these the most notable is the season 4 finale involving their pursuer general fullbright enlisting their help to go back to vietnam to find his

we can insult each other but when outsiders do it we close ranks bit the barnum face genuinely reveled in being a con man and never showed signs of wanting to reform he seemed to love the scheme just as much as the payoff this makes sense when you think about it face though not a coward by any stretch often shows signs of not liking violence that much he probably likes trying to con people so they can get away without a shootout or fistfight  not that he doesnt enjoy the con for its own sake mind you bavarian fire drill half the series is one long string of these after the other from conning a

love it when a plan comes together hannibals standardized greeting what do ya say name chained to a railway in order to get councilman prescott to sign a paper they tied him to railway tracks at the end of a tunnel he wouldnt talk at first but soon he noticed a train approaching from the far end of the tunnel and signed it only for hannibal to leave that guy tied to the tracks of course it was then revealed that the oncoming train was just murdock on a bike complete with a highpowered lamp a fake chimney and a tape player with train sound effects chair reveal murdocks back is seen for about a minute behind hannibal and face in members only before he turns around they are at a very upscale country club where face is trying hard to become a member and murdock is there as a guest of his doctor the chick amy amanda triple a allen a newspaper reporter who assisted the team in the first season and part of the second she was eventually sent to jakarta on assignment when conflicts between culea and the producers led to her departure either by firing or her simply getting fed up at having no dialog the role of the chick was next filled by suspiciously similar substitute tawnia baker for the rest of season 2 and early portions of season 3 before she got married and moved to la with no new actress brought in to fill the archetype for the rest of the series the new character of tia was set up at the very end of season 4 to become this but due to the actresss contractual obligations she was never seen or mentioned again according to both dirk benedict and george peppard triple a and her counterpart were there only because of studio demands and the male leads felt that a female on the show slowed the action down too much this trope was actually the reason george peppard was so insistent on keeping women off the show in his wordswhenever the studio slips an actress on to the team she becomes a distraction she always slows down the action shes someone whos only there for the glamour shots everything stops for the sexy smiles – and i cant see why thats necessary on the ateam chick magnet face can attract women even when hes trying to focus on someone else cigarfuse lighting in one episode the team juryrig a flamethrower but fail to juryrig a pilot light instead the instructions are throw the cigar in front of you then open up clear my name the premise of the fifth season though it never came to be before the show was canceled this is also what forced the team into hiding the crime they didnt commit was eventually revealed to be a bank robbery in hanoi vietnam which they were in fact ordered to do but the man who gave them the order was killed and all evidence of his orders destroyed in the fifth season premiere they were cleared of the robbery when a former vietnamese colonel testified in their courtmartial that their commanding officer sent them to rob a bank in order for them to be captured by the north vietnamese of course by that time the ateam was being tried for the murder of their commanding officer clip show the episode curtain call has several of the main characters remember scenes from previous episodes also qualifies as a day in the limelight for murdock since many the scenes involves capt murdock whos been seriously injured clothing damage played for laughs in  the little town with an accent  to impersonate a gangster and infiltrate a meeting the team kidnap him and send murdock in with his clothes the gangster escapes and blows murdocks cover in the middle of the meeting but stops people from shooting him so as to not damage his clothes cloudcuckoolander murdock its never made entirely clear whether hes actually insane or just acting so he can keep living in the veterans administration hospital one way or the other hes a textbook example of a cloudcuckoolander which b a absolutely hates comicbook adaptation marvel comics put out a shortlived comic based on the amy allen era complaining about rescues they dont like in the only church in town the mother superior of the orphanage the team saves is quite unhappy with the team using force to drive off the bandits terrorizing them this is because the bandits are just a small squad from a much larger gang and angering them means the rest of the gang will return and try to destroy the orphanage in  harder than it looks  when the team rescues a girl from the terrorist group holding her hostage she fights them every step of the way and even holds them at gunpoint and demands they take her back her boyfriend is a member of the group who has been questioning their methods and she knows the groups leaders are just looking for an excuse to off him shes worried theyll think he helped her escape and kill him in  deadly maneuvers  murdock borrows one of b a s necklaces a sharp crescent moon to cut their ropes and free them in the process he inadvertently implies that b a is fat and also accidentally breaks the gold chain to the necklace both of which b a complains about in  hot styles  a large part of the plot revolves around the damsel in distress s unwillingness to let face and his friends save her it turns out the villain is also holding her young son and shes afraid hell be hurt if she tries to escape consulting mister puppet murdock sometimes converses with a sock puppet another great way of annoying b a cool and unusual punishment one episode has the team knocking out b a again so they can get on a plane this time however theyre in the middle of a mission so they cant wait for him to calm down hannibal decides that the only way to solve the problem is to let b a take his revenge on them after the mission is over which face and murdock are horrified about b a is creepily cheerful throughout the rest of the episode and the team dreads what hell do to them finally when its all over b a prepares to punish them he lines them all up and calls them out on their flaws and why they annoy him b a also reveals that instead of flying back hes chartered a boat as part of their payment the rest of the team has to help with the upkeep as well as repaint the whole thing the team decides they wouldve preferred if he had just beaten them up also used to interrogate a villain in mind games murdock as the casanova wannabe hunk man offers to charm the information they want from the enemy hannibal suggests that this would be equally as torturous as simply letting b a beat the crap out of the guy could have been messy every episode has a scene where the ateam and their opponents exchange billions of rounds of gunfire nobody is ever shot ever averted in the season four finale fullbright is fatally wounded by a vietnamese general as the team makes their escape and hannibal retaliates by blowing up the shed he was in well there are the two times in which murdock and face get shot but both times only a single bullet is fired and in the first scene of the episode pros and cons involving illegal prison fights the warden strides up to the loser and points a gun at him  we dont see what happens next but a rematch is unlikely covert distress code red ball one and bag is leaking mean big trouble and one of the team took some lead as explained to amy by murdock who receives the code from the team cowboy episode when you comin back range rider  parts one and two the whole episode is partially played out like a western with the team dressing up like cowboys using smaller guns and stopping bus train murdock as the range rider especially plays it up much to b a s annoyance cut phone lines examples season 1 ep 6 black day at bad rock where bikers cut down a pole and season 2 ep 10 water water everywhere where phone lines at a water plant are cut destructive saviour very much so the millions of dollars worth of property damage the ateam causes per episode would be enough for them to be considered criminals even if they werent already wanted by the government diegetic switch as the team decorates their own restaurant in an ateam montage in  the big squeeze  they bring in a piano faceman continues the background music on it which starts again after he stops dirty coward charles lake in  where is the monster when you need him  even given the situation being held captive by a foreign war criminal hes still takes it a bit far charles maybe if we tell him well do anything he wants promise not to tell

several times on the show in  till death do us part  murdock dresses like the bride while the team helps the real bride escape at the beginning of  one more time  hannibal dresses like an old woman

that is bad element in japanese b a baracus keeps his original name but is nicknamed kong this is made clear in the opening credits where each japanese voice actor would do a short selfintroduction in character when their character appeared on the screen b a s opening line translates as b a baracus aka kong even evil has standards in the twoparter the bend in the river the river pirate el cajón is

a job or youre some kind of con artist and let me tell you i hate con artists always trying to turn people off of their life savings face yeah i guess its not an honest crime like gambling or drug dealing also the mercenary insane wayne from  waiting for insane wayne  upon hearing that his target is already dead and the targets teenage son is the new target he initially refuses to take the job and only changes his mind when he learns the ateam is involved wayne a 15year old kid im sorry chief me and my men dont raid nurseries every car is a pinto cars seem to flip over and explode at the drop of a hat but we always see the goons crawling away safe and sound failed a spot check has happened a few times to the team most notably in incident at crystal lake face comes across a woman stranded on the side of the road whose car battery supposedly died hours ago except shes blasting her car radio when he shows up face completely fails to pick up on this and nearly falls into colonel

hannibal effects an escape by hiding under his bunk and deceiving his captors into believing he has escaped they leave the cell door open and he makes a break for it flatline plotline the team is

murdocks love of animals and b a s love of milk to capture them friendship moment with the heroes of the series being a band of brothers its not exactly surprising when there are moments affirming how they feel about each other in  holiday in the hills  b a makes sure to tell murdock to be careful with the makeshift plane they cobbled together as its not as durable as what hes used to murdock in an accent i didnt know you cared sweetheart pulling him closer thanks b a b a smiling dont thank me just keep it off the trees the episode  curtain call  — from b a looking after the injured murdock to hannibal telling him that  we go out together or we dont go out at all  to face risking getting caught by decker to get the medical supplies needed to keep murdock alive — is a long list of moments that demonstrate how much the other members of the group care about their crazy teammate friend to all children b a amazingly enough he may be a big tough guy who can easily smack down the villains of

willingness to use unscrupulous tactics to secure victory b a yeah hannibal and this guy mixed it up once in the doom club  amy what he didnt like the way you sugared his coffee hannibal no i didnt like the way he blew up cong hospitals like it was his favorite sport genre blind loan shark jack lane in the big squeeze he ends the episode firmly on his bosss hit list but even so its curious how a moron like him managed to become a kingpins lieutenant to begin with gone horribly right a humorous example from mind games face irritated at murdock refusing to give back his role on the team murdock had taken it over when face was released on an apparent government pardon starts doing a howling mad murdock impression unfortunately thats when the v a staff arrive and with face acting cuckoo and wearing murdocks clothes they cant tell that he isnt murdock and drag him out the door hellhole prison the prison in pros and cons the warden encourages fighting in order to scout out candidates for the fight program those that do good enough are separated trained and forced to fight to death even for prisoners who cant fight it doesnt seem to be a great place its not a very safe prison thanks to the aforementioned encouraged fighting plus the warden apparently thinks letting the prisoners get their hair cut is coddling hero antagonist colonel lynch colonel decker and general fullbright along with their units though they oppose the ateam theyre not evil or corrupt  theyre good soldiers who honestly believe that the ateam are dangerous criminals who must be brought to justice  which is not an unreasonable belief  highaltitude interrogation in  uncle buckleup  the team interrogate a mook by having ba hold him over a cliff above the carnivore pit at a zoo homage in the fifth season episode  the say u n c l e affair  the series paired robert napoleon solo vaughn playing regular character general hunt stockwell with former costar david illya kuryakin mc callum the episode the spy

down lest his coworkers think his sales are all plants icecream koan hannibal in his disguise as irish pub owner sean oshea rapidfires these at everybody in the big squeeze hannibal as me dear departed father used to say always listen to the flow of the river and youll always catch a trout villain what the hell is that supposed to mean hannibal i dont know never figured it out but ive always liked it i have many names while the whole team had a ton of aliases face takes the cake for most names even without counting aliases according to the episode mind games actually your name was originally alvin brenner you had it legally changed to al brennan then to al peck then to holmes morrison then morrison holmes and then to templeton peck imaginary friend murdock has a few most notably his invisible dog billy who is mentioned in several different episodes i want you to meet an old friend of mine the say u n c l e affair in which robert vaughn is kidnapped by his former partner david mc callum improbable weapon user the ateam has welded together and used weapons ranging from soda cannons to cabbage guns these are always more efficient than the machine guns their opponents typically use against them or viceversa for that matter inconveniently vanishing exonerating evidence a larger scale version twice to the ateam the team were ordered by their commanding officer morrison to rob the bank of hanoi as part of a secret mission but was then killed in an artillery strike and since the mission wasnt public knowledge the only people who knew the team werent just bank robbers were the team themselves the second was when it was revealed morrison had been a traitor and had sent them in to be ambushed and killed which gave them motive for morrisons death the witness who could prove that they werent responsible ends up being killed by his criminal partners before the truth could come out instant expert according to murdock one day at the v a hospital he had a sudden and terrible migraine headache and by the time it passed he could read and speak fluent mandarin irish priest faceman is disguised as father sean oherlihy in lease with an option to die i shall taunt you an implied example occurs in  when you comin back range rider  face comments that b a must be getting weak if he cant break the rope theyre tied with b a breaks them quickly afterwards i will show you x b a would often respond in this way to whatever nonsense murdock was spouting some of them barely made sense but murdock didnt always give him much to work with and b a doesnt like to mince words kansas city shuffle in till death do us part hannibal brings back hamburgers for the team and the woman theyve rescued b a having heard them talking about flying looks at his burger with suspicion and switches with murdock murdock takes a few bites and falls over apparently sedated b a confident in having outwitted his teammates takes a bite of murdocks burgerand falls over himself whereupon murdock pops up and asks how did i do lampshade hanging at the end of the episode the crystal skull the natives are clearly chanting who wrote this who wrote this also in steel when murdock and face arrive at a construction scene where hannibal and b a are duking it out with some goons face casually takes off his coat rolls his eyes and remarks that this should be predictable by now lets get dangerous  when murdock stops acting crazy and started being badass usually at an episodes climax lets you and him fight in  mexican slayride part ii  the people in the bar who the team gets into a fight with trying to learn masseys whereabouts are actually good guys as well but nobody realizes theyre on the same side until after theyve fought and b a and hannibal have been punched out life saving misfortune a nonfatal variation in the episode holiday in the hills near the beginning of the episode the team crashes thanks to murdock having stolen their plane off a repair lot some of them especially b a are not at all happy about this then near the end of the episode the team narrowly escapes col lynch and realizes that had they not crashed they would have been right on time to fall into his trap locking mac gyver in the store cupboard the ateam tends to get locked in barns or garages full of machinery and explosive things lampshaded in one episode by hannibal hannibal after a giant truck of destruction has burst out of a shed where exactly did you lock up my team bad guy in the old equipment shed hannibal what an original idea i wonder where you came up with that one also lampshaded in one of the novelizations when hannibal notices how often the bad guys lock them in a room that has everything they need for them to escape perhaps the most bizarre example of this is the episode the heart of rock and roll where the team is captured inside a prison yet are inexplicably locked up in an unguarded workshop the guards dont even bother handcuffing them lunatic loophole a nonfatal variation murdock occasionally ends up being the only member of the team to escape arrest metallicar syndrome since their van had a custom paint job the authorities should have spotted them a lot more often than they did face lampshades this in the season 2 episode steel when hannibal tells him to keep tailing the episodes villain in his corvette which was white with black trim and a bright red stripe along the sides face says that the villain will definitely be able to tell hes been following him mr smith mentioned with regards to a cia agents obvious alias in mind games hannibal nobodys named john jones mythology gag the episode where a cylon from battlestar galactica 1978 walks by on a movie set incorporated into the opening theme from season 3 onwards nitro express there was an episode where they were transporting dynamite  which is not normally volatile untilunless it has a blasting cap attached  but it was really really hot and as a result the sticks of dynamite were sweating nitroglycerin no celebrities were harmed in members only theres a brief appearance by a film executive named jeff sikorski a dead ringer for martin scorsese nobody can die since it was classified as a childrens show note you have the ridiculous premise in which the ateam amasses a massive arsenal of machine guns and weaponry faces off against a similarly armed force exchanges thousands of bullets — and everyone lives it wasnt until the series 4 finale that a recurring character actually died on camera discussion of a death was permitted and you see at least two people executed with gory discretion shot at the ready at least in the first couple of seasons averted in  the rabbit who ate las vegas  gianni christians second in command pushes him out a window we see him plummet into a fountain several stories below and hes actively reported to be dead unfortunately the ateam gets blamed for it also averted in  skins  in the opening park ranger kim comes upon a group of poachers when their attempt to bribe him fails they shoot him and the viewer sees his body fall to the ground related to this in cases where death would be expected such as car crashes there is always a shot of the occupants getting out apparently unharmed made ridiculous with particularly rough crashes and an exploding helicopter no communities were harmed diamonds n dust takes place in zulabwe africa standing in for zimbabwe it has a significant population of european descent some speaking with a commonwealth accent some with an american one cities bulawayo and salisbury the latter already renamed to harare at the airing of the episode were harmed through a mention in the episode no one could survive that  in one episode a helicopter crashes against a cliff explodes falls down explodes again and then bad guys crawl out from it novelization there were ten books published in the 1980s some the first book an adaptation of the pilot when you comin back range rider the bend in the river were based on doublelength episodes others blended together two basically unrelated episodes  small but deadly wars welded a small and deadly war and black day at bad rock old

jamestown obfuscating insanity murdock combines with obfuscating stupidity to make his awesome moments of competence seem even more awesome hes probably one of the supreme users of this trope murdock did it so well that it was unclear whether or not he actually was so traumatized by vietnam that he did go insane he was always like this or it was all an act to throw people off one episode had murdock discharged by his doctor claiming he was never insane without his particular character trait murdock essentially spends the episode moping but acting reasonable when he goes back to the hospital to gather his things he finds out the doctor had gone insane and was releasing patients because of it murdock quickly and happily goes back into the insanity ward doing so while doing a ham richard burton impersonation to bootodd friendship face and murdock the insane delusional wisecracking pilot and the suave handsome unrepentant con man probably shouldnt be best friends but they are then again theyre both chameleonlike tricksters during scams in fact of the whole team theyre probably the most alike you just cant tell at first glance murdock and b a murdocks the ace pilot in the team b a s afraid of flying and thats just the start of their differences at the end of the day however each has the others back without reservation lampshaded by the song opposites attract being played over a montage of the two of them at the end of curtain call were opposites were idiots but were still friends old beggar test a nonmagical variation in  mexican slayride part i  hannibal tests amys character by appearing to her as a beggar who needs money amy has compassion on the beggar which helps convince hannibal that shes a good person omniglot murdock can speak several languages claiming that one day he had a headache and could suddenly speak several asian languages fluently he also imitated various accents several times per episode once an episode hannibal in disguise contacts the clients of the week b a says about murdock the fool is crazy or some variation on that the team breaks murdock out of the insane asylum until hes released in the final season b a gets tricked into being drugged so they can put him on a plane the team comes up with a plan thats crazy enough to work which involves face pretending to be someone hes not theres a bit of mac gyvering in an ateam montage  followed by a climactic final battle featuring lots of ateam firing i love it when a plan comes together other things that tend to happen a lot are face jumping off the top of a van onto a bad guy and hannibal punching someone out and then putting a cigar in his mouth only known by initials b a baracus because of his nickname bad attitude and his real name bosco albert and h m murdock because of his nickname howling mad only known by their nickname face is pretty much the only member of the ateam who regularly goes by his real name hannibal rarely ever goes by john smith b a baracus and h m murdock never go by their full names either overt operative quite often the team goes by their well known names instead of an alias even when theyre supposed to be undercover paperthin disguise some of hannibals disguises are along the lines of a bad wig and maybe a moustache somehow it manages to fool even his fellow teammates from time to time the pirates who dont do anything in theory the ateam are a band of mercenaries who lease their skills out for cash so they can stay on the run however they never seem to ever participate in a job thats even slightly shady and they rarely seem to get paid for whatever they do hannibal is a double example technically he has a day job as an actor but his work with the ateam means that whenever hes seen around a movie set hes usually pulled away by some business much to the dismay of the other people on the set pity the kidnapper in bounty when murdock gets abducted by bounty hunters he manages to drive his kidnappers nuts before they even get back to their hideout even death threats dont manage to shut him up for long villain what are you nuts murdock of course i am you got me from the psychiatric ward of a v a hospital stupidplease shoot the messenger in  recipe for heavy bread  a former north vietnamese soldier who helped the ateam out was smuggled into the u s along with a note along these lines for the smugglers accomplice the murder attempt kickstarts the episodes plot police are useless multiple episodes established this quickly to explain why the client of the week needed to approach the ateam instead of the cops to deal with the villain of the week the cops were usually just being bought off by the villain in question though sometimes the cops were the villains on other occasions the small local police agencies were simply overwhelmed and outgunned by the criminal element this ended in the final season due to the change in format poorly timed confession in season 5 family reunion murdock finds out partway through the episode that one of their clients for the episode a j bancroft is faces disappeared dad bancroft begs murdock to let him break the news but he can never quite work up the nerve and dies before managing to do it this leaves murdock to tell face about it as face has always been upset about never having a family growing up he understandably does not react well posthumous character ray brenner was a fifth member of the team in vietnam whom the others remember in a heroic and respectful fashion in a first season episode they risk capture to attend and take part in his funeral with full military honors they quickly learn from his widow guest star joanna kerns that he died trying to free his small hometown from a local outlaw family they promptly seek revenge and justice for their fallen comrade pro wrestling episode  body slam  starred hulk hogan in a plot that made heavy use of hogans wrestling career including footage from a 1984 match vs greg the hammer valentine presented as legit and featured several wwf faces as unbilled extras in a scene where they fight off that episodes villains in the segment featuring the hoganvalentine match the ending is altered to show the bad guys entering the arena to confront and assassinate hogan dont worry theyre stopped in time product placement an odd case the van was supplied by gmc but the grille and emblems were then blacked out and obscured by a brushguard making it indistinguishable from a chevrolet confusing things even more the prop van used for build montages was a chevrolet and the blacked out chevy emblem could be clearly seen in certain shots punch punch punch uh oh b a was the unusual protagonist example whod let the mook get in a good punch or two before smiling then defenestrating them inverted twice when b a met a giant asian mook who could take his punches without flinching in  double heat  face tries to punch out the guy who helped the kidnappers nab jenny

to get away with no repercussions and ordered him to leave town however he cant resist stopping by to kill the mayers and wreck their boat for causing him trouble right under their noses hannibal

hannibal  done by colonel decker in an episode when hes forced to work with a group of criminals to try and capture the ateam the criminals assuming decker is a dirty cop try to make friends with him

fact that even the show spelled it wrong in her first appearance stay in the kitchen the ateam are reluctant to even take women along with them for the most part and make a point of trying to keep them out of harms way offscreen as well george peppard worked to get rid of the female main characters feeling they would slow down the action too much though he was mostly cordial to the actresses marla heasley spoke of feeling unwelcome on the set and said in particular that peppard told her on both her first and last episodes that nobody wanted her there except the network stock footage most notably in the beast from the belly of a boeing when murdock crashes the plane into the airports terminal the scenes borrowed from airplane suspiciously similar substitute tawnia who replaced amy midway through season 2 and stayed through part of season 3 filled an identical role of a reporter and the chick syndication title the 2hour pilot movie was cut to two 45minute parts in syndication and renamed mexican slayride take that  the character of joe skrylow in there goes the neighborhood is an episode long example aimed at survivalists his dialog hints at racist homophobic and valor stealing tendencies and the episode shows him to be an insulting utterly inept obese glory hound knownothing knowitall who ends up blowing the teams cover when he sees the false news that they kidnapped stevi taking the bullet in curtain call murdock jumps in front of a villain trying to shoot hannibal taught by television in  a small and deadly war  face mentions that he learned most of his best cons from dragnet temporary substitute in  fire  decker was replaced by colonel briggs who was simply intended to be a oneoff character when deckers actor lance le gault had a scheduling conflict briggs even mimicked all of deckers mannerisms terrible artist murdock is shown to be actually terrible while undercover as a painter in  beverly hills assault  took the bad film seriously inuniverse being a fugitive the best acting jobs hannibal can get are zlist people in rubber suits roles yet he treats them as if hes going for an oscar the triads and the tongs the maltese cow which dealt with a chinese restaurant being threatened by a chinese tong trojan horse the team uses one to sneak into an enemy base the horse was a delivery truck full of whiskey and the base was a convent

villain over for dinner through b a s eyes in lease with an option to die with his mother and his vitriolic best bud murdock virtue is weakness in  curtain call  col decker talks about how having one man wounded will make the ateams ability crumble as they try to save their injured member hes right that it hampers them but it doesnt stop them given that the virtue in question is loyalty to their injured friend it overlaps with a platonic version of love is a weakness colonel decker the ateam think as one feel as one and act as one but with a wounded man in their midst they cease to be that the good of the unit becomes the good of an individual and that will be their undoing it occurs again when hannibal surrenders to him because murdock is too weak to be moved he remarks that hannibal should have tried to shoot his way out as he himself wasnt hurt vitriolic best buds a fair portion of b a s dialogue is devoted to insulting murdock and trying to get him to shut up sometimes note b a actually tries to throttle murdock murdock sometimes takes a break from being a pest in b a s general direction to insult b a b a actually complains about being saved from a lifethreatening injury because getting murdocks blood might make him like murdock murdock encourages these fears after giving the blood however its clear that they care about each other quite a lot b a really worries about murdock when murdock is in trouble and murdock really does try wellmeaningly to help b a learn to deal with airplanes among other instances of sincerely meant aid there is even one episode where the b amurdock dynamic seems to flip so that murdock is giving b a much more grief than hes getting b a also told off at least one person outside the ateam who complained that murdock should shut up and it was nicely done murdock while b a is knocked out im worried about him hannibal its been almost a full day and we havent insulted each other—i think i may go into withdrawal soon walking the earth
