ft david from hagen construction  design llc in ambler5292012 at 54303 pmyou could easily have 2500 a square foot on materials all according to what levelquality of finish you want you need to know what you need to do to install a bathroom rough plumbing is the big one heat and ac are another big one some people think you wont need to do that the basement is always warm in winter cool in summer not so when finished labor can vary a lot all according to where you live a second egress will need to be installed per code and that is with no bedrooms if you want a room to be a bedroom it needs its own egress if you hire a good licensed insured gc it should be 253500 per square foot again according to the level of finish and codes is the basement dry whats needed to fix it if it has water hope this helps david hagen scott from cut above building systems in queen creek5292012 at 55148 pmcost do vary depending opinion number of rooms size of bath etc framing cost run any where from 10 to

bussiness 35ft is a good starting point the bath about 5000 for a simple average bath really there too many variables to lock in a per sq ft price of course the price can vary greatly depending on the location its really better to get some exact prices from some well qualified contractors  ultimately chose the one that gives you the best value for your money he is usually not the lowest price henry

there anything specific that we should not be overlooked or skipped when renovating a basement i want it to look good but i also want to make sure its going to be functional for years down the road thank you so much for your time i will definitely be coming back here to find a contractor when were ready to proceed with our basementwalter from walter construction in sayreville5302012 at 33907 pmdepending on the materials i would say around 14000 mj salese construction in bangor782012 at 103539 pmexpect to pay around 2000  2500 per sq ft in brooklyn make sure the contractor has access to the job site for offloading materials also make sure they have parking you dont want to pay extra for things that may hold them up when doing a basement renovation any were in the 5 boroughs you need to test the humidity in the basement first and make sure its dry also verify there is no water coming in to the building this is the most important part of the job if there is an indication of high humidity or water seeping through foundation get that corrected first next would be your layout take a chalk box and snap some lines making sure your room size s are adequate will you be putting in a bathroom or kitchen you need to figure this cost in addition to the building and refinishing floating floors are better then carpeting when renovating a basement when under lament is applied correctly carpeting holds moisture and feels damp without proper circulation you can always use throw rugs if you are building a kitchen or bath use ceramic tile for floor finishing your ceiling with acoustical ceiling tiles will cost between 3 and 5 per sq ft lighting add aprox 5000 per fixture labor only outlets add switches add between 4050 per unit laminate floors range from 68 per sq ft labor only materials cost between 1 and 3 plus under lament at 5000 per roll i also recommend steel studs rather than conventional wood framing and also fire rated x 58 gwb so to sum up i have estimated the following based on 1000 sq ft  framing lm 3500 drywall lm1800 painting lm  1200 act lm5000 4 lighting fixtures200 6 outlets  switches 300  2 int doors labor only 75 ea floating floor based on 200 sq ft mat and 600sq ft labor 8000 and trim work for base trim and doors lm 1500 with just these items your looking at a rough estimate of about 2200000 without waterproofing kitchen or bathroom you should expect to spend between 2000 to 2500 per sq ft for a basic minimum job eric in fairfax1172014 at 20434 amwhen someone is talking about 2535 a sq ft are you talking about the sq footage of the
