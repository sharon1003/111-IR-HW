cytokeratin from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search keratin intermediate filaments in epithelial cells red stain cytokeratins are keratin proteins found in the intracytoplasmic cytoskeleton of epithelial tissue they are an important component of intermediate filaments which help cells resist mechanical stress 1 expression of these cytokeratins within epithelial cells is largely specific to particular organs or tissues thus they are used clinically to identify the cell of origin of various human tumors contents  hide 1 naming2 types3 molecular biology4 cell biology5 references6 external links naming  editthe term cytokeratin began to be used in the late 1970s when the protein subunits of keratin intermediate filaments inside cells were first being identified and characterized 2 in 2006 a new systematic nomenclature for mammalian keratins was created and the proteins previously called cytokeratins are simply called keratins human epithelial category for example cytokeratin4 ck4 has been renamed keratin4 k4 3 however they are still commonly referred to as cytokeratins in clinical practice types  editmicrograph showing low molecular weight cytokeratin lmwck staining of intermediate trophoblast  placental tissue and endometrial glands there are two categories of cytokeratins the acidic type i cytokeratins and the basic or neutral type ii cytokeratins within each category cytokeratins are numbered in order of decreasing size from low molecular weight lmwcks to high molecular weight hmwcks cytokeratins are usually found in heterodimeric

the moment in the course of terminal differentiation and the stage of development thus a specific cytokeratin expression profile allows the identification of epithelial cells furthermore this applies also to the malignant counterparts of the epithelia  carcinomas  as the cytokeratin profile is generally retained thus the study of cytokeratin expression by immunohistochemistry techniques is a tool of immense value widely used for tumor diagnosis and characterization in surgical pathology 5cytokeratin sites cytokeratin 4nonkeratinized squamous epithelium including cornea and transitional

 editthe cytokeratins are encoded by a family encompassing 30 genes among them 20 are epithelial genes and the remaining 10 are specific for trichocytes all cytokeratin chains are composed of a central αhelixrich domain with a 5090 sequence identity among cytokeratins of the same type and around 30 between cytokeratins of different type with nonαhelical n and cterminal domains the αhelical domain has 310150 amino acids and comprises four segments in which a sevenresidue pattern repeats into this repeated pattern the first and fourth residues are hydrophobic and the charged residues show alternate positive and negative polarity resulting in the polar residues being located on one side of the helix this central domain of the chain provides the molecular alignment in the keratin structure and makes the chains form coiled dimers in solution the enddomain sequences of type i and ii cytokeratin chains contain in both sides of the rod domain the subdomains v1 and v2 which have variable size and sequence the type ii also presents the conserved subdomains h1 and h2 encompassing 36 and 20 residues respectively the subdomains v1 and v2 contain residues enriched by glycines andor serines the former providing the cytokeratin chain a strong insoluble character and facilitating the interaction with other molecules these terminal domains are also important in the defining the function of the cytokeratin chain characteristic of a particular epithelial cell type two dimers of cytokeratin groups into a keratin tetramer by antiparallel binding this cytokeratin tetramer is considered to be the main building block of the cytokeratin chain by headtotail linking of the cytokeratin tetramers the protofilaments are originated which in turn intertwine in pairs to form protofibrils four protofibrils give place to one cytokeratin filament cytokeratin filaments in the human epithelial cell cell biology  editin the cytoplasm the keratin filaments conform a complex network which extends from the surface of the nucleus to the cell membrane numerous accessory proteins are involved in the genesis and maintenance of such structure this association between the plasma membrane and the nuclear surface provides important implications for the organization of the cytoplasm and cellular communication mechanisms apart from the relatively static functions provided in terms of supporting the nucleus and providing tensile strength to the cell the cytokeratin networks undergo rapid phosphate exchanges mediated depolymerization with important implications in the more dynamic cellular processes such as mitosis and postmitotic period cell movement and differentiation cytokeratins interact with desmosomes and hemidesmosomes thus collaborating to cellcell adhesion and basal cellunderlying connective tissue connection the intermediate filaments of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton which the cytokeratins are one of its three components have been probed to associate also with the ankyrin and spectrin complex protein network that underlies the cell membrane  citation neededreferences  edit herrmann h bär h kreplak l strelkov sv aebi u july 2007 intermediate filaments
