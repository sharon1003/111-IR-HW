the poem is classified as an elegy or mourning poem and was written to honor abraham lincoln the 16th president of the united states walt whitman was born in 1819 and died in 1892 and the american civil war was the central event of his life whitman was a staunch unionist during the civil war he was initially indifferent to lincoln but as the war pressed on whitman came to love the president though the two men never met 1the fallen captain in the poem refers to abraham lincoln captain of the ship that is the united states of america the first line establishes the poems mood one of relief that the civil war has ended our fearful trip is done the next line references the ship america and how it has weathered every rack meaning america has braved the tough storm of the civil war and the prize we sought the preservation of the union is won the following line expresses a mood of jubilation of the union winning the war as it says the people all exulting however the next line swiftly shifts the mood when it talks of the grimness of the ship and the darker side of the war many lost their lives in the american civil war and although the prize that was sought was won the hearts still ache amidst the exultation of the people the repetition of heart in line five calls attention to the poets vast grief and heartache because the captain has bled and lies still cold and dead lines six through eight this is no doubt referencing the assassination of abraham lincoln and whitmans sorrow for the death of his idol in the second stanza the speaker again calls out to the captain to rise up and hear the bells to join in the celebration of the end of the war the next three lines tell the captain to rise up and join in on the revelries because it is for him he is the reason for their merriment for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills for you bouquets and ribbond wreaths—for you the shores acrowding for you they call the swaying mass their eager faces turning everyone is celebrating what lincoln accomplished the abolition of slavery and the unification of the people after a fearful war again the poet calls to the captain as if he had never fallen the poet does not wish to acknowledge the death of his beloved captain and he even asks if it is some dream line 15 that the captain has fallen cold and dead the third stanza begins in a somber mood as the poet has finally accepted that the captain is dead and gone here there is vivid and darker imagery such as his lips are pale and still and the reader can picture the dead captain lying there still and motionless with no pulse nor will in line 17 the poet calls out my captain and in line 18 the poet refers to the captain as my father this is referring to lincoln as the father of the united states lines 19 and 20 are concluding statements that summarize the entire poem the united states is anchord safe and sound it is safe now from war with its voyage closed and done from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won in line 21 the examples of apostrophe ordering shores to exult and bells to ring are again referring to how the nation is celebrating while i with mournful tread walk the deck my captain lies fallen cold and dead throughout the paper there is a distinct rhyme scheme which is unusual for whitman the rhyme scheme in o captain my captain is aabcdefe gghijeke and llmnoepe for each stanza respectively two examples of alliteration are in line 10 flag is flung as well as in line 19 safe and sound repetition occurs many times in this poem for example o captain my captain and fallen cold and dead“o captain my captain” became one of whitman’s most famous poems one that he would read at the end of his famous lecture about the lincoln assassination whitman became
