editlance corporal lcpl is the third enlisted rank in order of seniority in the united states marine corps just above private first class and below corporal it is not a noncommissioned officer rank it is the most common rank in the usmc the usmc is the only component of the u s armed forces to currently have lance corporals promotion to lance corporal is based on time in grade time in service and the conduct of the marine further promotion to the nco ranks corporal and above is competitive and takes into account the individual service record of the marine there can only be a certain number of corporals and sergeants in each mos so even with a qualifying score promotions may be delayed due to an excessive number of corporals occupying billets in a certain mos from the earliest years of the corps the ranks of lance corporal and lance sergeant were in common usage the rank of lance corporal has been in the marine corps since the 1830s marines were appointed temporarily from the next lower
