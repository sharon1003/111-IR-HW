metalloprotein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates 4 with the exception of the fish family channichthyidae 5 as well as the tissues of some invertebrates hemoglobin in the blood carries oxygen from the lungs or gills to the rest of the body ie the tissues there it releases the oxygen to permit aerobic respiration to provide energy to power the functions of the organism in the process called metabolism a healthy individual has 12 to 16 grams of haemoglobin in every 100 ml of blood in mammals the protein makes up about 96 of the red blood cells dry content by weight and around 35 of the total content including water 6 hemoglobin has an oxygenbinding capacity of 134 m l o 2 per gram 7 which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventyfold compared to dissolved oxygen in blood the mammalian hemoglobin molecule can bind carry up to four oxygen molecules 8hemoglobin is involved in the transport of other gases it carries some of the bodys respiratory carbon dioxide about 20–25 of the total 9 as carbaminohemoglobin in which co 2 is bound to the globin protein the molecule also carries the important regulatory molecule nitric oxide bound to a globin protein thiol group releasing it at the same time as oxygen 10hemoglobin is also found outside red blood cells and their progenitor lines other cells that contain hemoglobin include the a9 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra macrophages alveolar cells and mesangial cells in the kidney in these tissues hemoglobin has a nonoxygencarrying function as an antioxidant and a regulator of iron metabolism 11hemoglobin and hemoglobinlike molecules are also found in many invertebrates fungi and plants 12 in these organisms hemoglobins may carry oxygen or they may act to transport and regulate other small molecules and ions such as carbon dioxide nitric oxide hydrogen sulfide and sulfide a variant of the molecule called leghemoglobin is used to scavenge oxygen away from anaerobic systems such as the nitrogenfixing nodules of leguminous plants before the oxygen can poison deactivate the system contents  hide 1 research history2 genetics3 synthesis4 structure41 oxygen saturation411 oxyhemoglobin412 deoxygenated

discovered that the ratio of iron to protein is identical in the hemoglobins of several species 14 from the known atomic mass of iron he calculated the molecular mass of hemoglobin to n × 16000  n  number of iron atoms per hemoglobin now known to be 4 the first determination of a proteins molecular mass this hasty conclusion drew a lot of ridicule at the time from scientists who could not believe that any molecule could be that big gilbert smithson adair confirmed engelhards results in 1925 by measuring the osmotic pressure of hemoglobin solutions 15the oxygencarrying protein hemoglobin was discovered by hünefeld in 1840 16 in 1851 17 german physiologist otto funke published a series of articles in which he described growing hemoglobin crystals by successively diluting red blood cells with a solvent such as pure water alcohol or ether followed by slow evaporation of the solvent from the resulting protein solution 18 hemoglobins reversible oxygenation was described a few years later by felix hoppeseyler 19in 1959 max perutz determined the molecular structure of hemoglobin by xray crystallography 20 21 this work resulted in his sharing with john kendrew the 1962 nobel prize in chemistry for their studies of the structures of globular proteins the role of hemoglobin in the blood was elucidated by french physiologist claude bernard the name hemoglobin is derived from the words heme and globin reflecting the fact that each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein with an embedded heme group each heme group contains one iron atom that can bind one oxygen molecule through ion induced dipole forces the most common type of hemoglobin in mammals contains four such subunits genetics  edithemoglobin consists of protein subunits the globin molecules and these proteins in turn are folded chains of a large number of different amino acids called polypeptides the amino acid sequence of any polypeptide created by a cell is in turn determined by the stretches of dna called genes in all proteins it is the amino acid sequence that determines the proteins chemical properties and function there is more than one hemoglobin gene in humans hemoglobin a the main form of hemoglobin present is coded for by the genes hba1 hba2 and hbb 22 the amino acid sequences of the globin proteins in hemoglobins usually differ between species these differences grow with evolutionary distance between species for example the most common hemoglobin sequences in humans and chimpanzees are nearly identical differing by only one amino acid in both the alpha and the beta globin protein chains  citation needed these differences grow larger between less closely related species even within a species different variants of hemoglobin always exist although one sequence is usually a most common one in each species mutations in the genes for the hemoglobin protein in a species result in hemoglobin variants 23 24 many of these mutant forms of hemoglobin cause no disease some of these mutant forms of hemoglobin however cause a group of hereditary diseases termed the hemoglobinopathies the best known hemoglobinopathy is sicklecell disease which was the first human disease whose mechanism was understood at the molecular level a mostly separate set of diseases called thalassemias involves underproduction of normal and sometimes abnormal hemoglobins through problems and mutations in globin gene regulation all these diseases produce anemia 25protein alignment of human hemoglobin proteins alpha beta and delta subunits respectively the alignments were created using uniprots alignment tool available online variations in hemoglobin amino acid sequences as with other proteins may be adaptive for example hemoglobin has been found to adapt in different ways to high altitudes organisms living at high elevations experience lower partial pressures of oxygen compared to those at sea level this presents a challenge to the organisms that inhabit such environments because hemoglobin which normally binds oxygen at high partial pressures of oxygen must be able to bind oxygen when it is present at a lower pressure different organisms have adapted to such a challenge for example recent studies have suggested genetic variants in deer mice that help explain how deer mice that live in the mountains are able to survive in the thin air that accompanies high altitudes a researcher from the university of nebraskalincoln found mutations in four different genes that can account for differences between deer mice that live in lowland prairies versus the mountains after examining wild mice captured from both highlands and lowlands it was found that the genes of the two breeds are virtually identical–except for those that govern the oxygencarrying capacity of their hemoglobin the genetic difference enables highland mice to make more efficient use of their oxygen since less is available at higher altitudes such as those in the mountains 26 mammoth hemoglobin featured mutations that allowed for oxygen delivery at lower temperatures thus enabling mammoths to migrate to higher latitudes during the pleistocene 27 this was also found in hummingbirds that inhabit the andes hummingbirds already expend a lot of energy and thus have high oxygen demands and yet andean hummingbirds have been found to thrive in high altitudes nonsynonymous mutations in the hemoglobin gene of multiple species living at high elevations  oreotrochilus a castelnaudii c violifer p gigas and a viridicuada have caused the protein to have less of an affinity for inositol hexaphosphate ihp a molecule found in birds that has a similar role as 23bpg in humans this results in the ability to bind oxygen in lower partial pressures 28birds unique circulatory lungs also promote efficient use of oxygen at low partial pressures of o 2 these two adaptations reinforce each other and account for birds remarkable highaltitude performance hemoglobin adaptation extends to humans as well studies have found that a small number of native tibetan women have a genotype which codes for hemoglobin to be more highly saturated with oxygen 29 natural selection seems to be the main force working on this gene because the mortality rate of offspring is significantly lower for women with higher hemoglobinoxygen affinity when compared to the mortality rate of offspring from women with low hemoglobinoxygen affinity while the exact genotype and mechanism by which this occurs is not yet clear selection is acting on these womens ability to bind oxygen in low partial pressures which overall allows them to better sustain crucial metabolic processes synthesis  edithemoglobin hb is synthesized in a complex series of steps the heme part is synthesized in a series of steps in the mitochondria and the cytosol of immature red blood cells while the globin protein parts are synthesized by ribosomes in the cytosol 30 production of hb continues in the cell throughout its early development from the proerythroblast to the reticulocyte in the bone marrow at this point the nucleus is lost in mammalian red blood cells but not in birds and many other species even after the loss of the nucleus in mammals residual ribosomal rna allows further synthesis of hb until the reticulocyte loses its rna soon after entering the vasculature this hemoglobinsynthetic rna in fact gives the reticulocyte its reticulated appearance and name 31structure  editheme b group hemoglobin has a quaternary structure characteristic of many multisubunit globular proteins 32 most of the amino acids in hemoglobin form alpha helices and these helices are connected by short nonhelical segments hydrogen bonds stabilize the helical sections inside this protein causing attractions within the molecule which then causes each polypeptide chain to fold into a specific shape 33 hemoglobins quaternary structure comes from its four subunits in roughly a tetrahedral arrangement 32in most vertebrates the hemoglobin molecule is an assembly of four globular protein subunits each subunit is composed of a protein chain tightly associated with a nonprotein prosthetic heme group each protein chain arranges into a set of alphahelix structural segments connected together in a globin fold arrangement such a name is given because this arrangement is the same folding motif used in other hemeglobin proteins such as myoglobin 34 35 this folding pattern contains a pocket that strongly binds the heme group a heme group consists of an iron fe ion charged atom held in a heterocyclic ring known as a porphyrin this porphyrin ring consists of four pyrrole molecules cyclically linked together by methine bridges with the iron ion bound in the center 36 the iron ion which is the site of oxygen binding coordinates with the four nitrogen atoms in the center of the ring which all lie in one plane the iron is bound strongly covalently to the globular protein via the n atoms of the imidazole ring of f8 histidine residue also known as the proximal histidine below the porphyrin ring a sixth position can reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate covalent bond 37 completing the octahedral group of six ligands oxygen binds in an endon bent geometry where one oxygen atom binds to fe and the other protrudes at an angle when oxygen is not bound a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site forming a distorted octahedron even though carbon dioxide is carried by hemoglobin it does not compete with oxygen for the ironbinding positions but is bound to the protein chains of the structure the iron ion may be either in the fe 2 or in the fe 3 state but ferrihemoglobin  methemoglobin fe 3 cannot bind oxygen 38 in binding oxygen temporarily and reversibly oxidizes fe 2 to fe 3 while oxygen temporarily turns into the superoxide ion thus iron must exist in the 2 oxidation state to bind oxygen if superoxide ion associated to fe 3 is protonated the hemoglobin iron will remain oxidized and incapable of binding oxygen in such cases the enzyme methemoglobin reductase will be able to eventually reactivate methemoglobin by reducing the iron center in adult humans the most common hemoglobin type is a tetramer which contains four subunit proteins called hemoglobin a consisting of two α and two β subunits noncovalently bound each made of 141 and 146 amino acid residues respectively this is denoted as α 2 β 2 the subunits are structurally similar and about the same size each subunit has a molecular weight of about 16000 daltons 39 for a total molecular weight of the tetramer of about 64000 daltons 64458 gmol 40 thus 1 gd l  01551 mmoll hemoglobin a is the most intensively studied of the hemoglobin molecules in human infants the hemoglobin molecule is made up of 2 α chains and 2 γ chains the gamma chains are gradually replaced by β chains as the infant grows 41the four polypeptide chains are bound to each other by salt bridges hydrogen bonds and the hydrophobic effect oxygen saturation  editin general hemoglobin can be saturated with oxygen molecules oxyhemoglobin or desaturated with oxygen molecules deoxyhemoglobin 42oxyhemoglobin  editoxyhemoglobin is formed during physiological respiration when oxygen binds to the heme component of the protein hemoglobin in red blood cells this process occurs in the pulmonary capillaries adjacent to the alveoli of the lungs the oxygen then travels through the blood stream to be dropped off at cells where it is utilized as a terminal electron acceptor in the production of atp by the process of oxidative phosphorylation it does not however help to counteract a decrease in blood p h ventilation or breathing may reverse this condition by removal of carbon dioxide thus causing a shift up in p h 43hemoglobin exists in two forms a taut tense form t and a relaxed form r various factors such as low p h high co 2 and high 23 bpg at the level of the tissues favor the taut form which has low oxygen affinity and releases oxygen in the tissues conversely a high p h low co 2 or low 23 bpg favors the relaxed form which can better bind oxygen 44 the partial pressure of the system also affects o 2 affinity where at high partial pressures of oxygen such as those present in the alveoli the relaxed high affinity r state is favoured inversely at low partial pressures such as those present in respiring tissues the low affinity t tense state is favoured 45 additionally the binding of oxygen to the iron ii heme pulls the iron into the plane of the porphyrin ring causing a slight conformational shift the shift encourages oxygen to bind to the three remaining heme units within hemoglobin thus oxygen binding is cooperative deoxygenated hemoglobin  editdeoxygenated hemoglobin is the form of hemoglobin without the bound oxygen the absorption spectra of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin differ the oxyhemoglobin has significantly lower absorption of the 660 nm wavelength than deoxyhemoglobin while at 940 nm its absorption is slightly higher this difference is used for the measurement of the amount of oxygen in a patients blood by an instrument called a pulse oximeter this difference also accounts for the presentation of cyanosis the blue to purplish color that tissues develop during hypoxia 46deoxygenated hemoglobin is paramagnetic it is weakly attracted to magnetic fields 47 48 in contrast oxygenated hemoglobin exhibits diamagnetism a weak repulsion from a magnetic field 48evolution of vertebrate hemoglobin  editscientists agree that the event that separated myoglobin from hemoglobin occurred after lampreys diverged from jawed vertebrates 49 this separation of myoglobin and hemoglobin allowed for the different functions of the two molecules to arise and develop myoglobin has more to do with oxygen storage while hemoglobin is tasked with oxygen transport 50 the α and βlike globin genes encode the individual subunits of the protein 22 the predecessors of these genes arose through another duplication event also after the gnathosome common ancestor derived from jawless fish approximately 450–500 million years ago 49 the development of α and β genes created the potential for hemoglobin to be composed of multiple subunits a physical composition central to hemoglobins ability to transport oxygen having multiple subunits contributes to hemoglobins ability to bind oxygen cooperatively as well as be regulated allosterically 50 subsequently the α gene also underwent a duplication event to form the hba1 and hba2 genes 51 these further duplications and divergences have created a diverse range of α and βlike globin genes that are regulated so that certain forms occur at different stages of development 50most ice fish of the family channichthyidae have lost their hemoglobin genes as an adaptation to cold water 5irons oxidation state in oxyhemoglobin  editassigning oxygenated hemoglobins oxidation state is difficult because oxyhemoglobin hbo 2  by experimental measurement is diamagnetic no net unpaired electrons yet the lowestenergy groundstate electron configurations in both oxygen and iron are paramagnetic suggesting at least one unpaired electron in the complex the lowestenergy form of oxygen and the lowest energy forms of the relevant oxidation states of iron are these triplet oxygen the lowestenergy molecular oxygen species has two unpaired electrons in antibonding π molecular orbitals iron ii tends to exist in a highspin 3d 6 configuration with four unpaired electrons iron iii 3d 5 has an odd number of electrons and thus must have one or more unpaired electrons in any energy state all of these structures are paramagnetic have unpaired electrons not diamagnetic thus a nonintuitive eg a higherenergy for at least one species distribution of electrons in the combination of iron and oxygen must exist in order to explain the observed diamagnetism and no unpaired electrons the two logical possibilities to produce diamagnetic no net spin hbo 2 are lowspin fe 2 binds to singlet oxygen both lowspin iron and singlet oxygen are diamagnetic however the singlet form of oxygen is the higherenergy form of the molecule lowspin fe 3 binds to o 2 •− the superoxide ion and the two unpaired electrons couple antiferromagnetically giving observed diamagnetic properties here the iron has been oxidized has lost one electron and the oxygen has been reduced has gained one electron another possible model in which lowspin fe 4 binds to peroxide o 2 2− can be ruled out by itself because the iron is paramagnetic although the peroxide ion is diamagnetic here the iron has been oxidized by two electrons and the oxygen reduced by two electrons direct experimental data xray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests iron has an oxidation state of approximately 32 infrared vibrational frequencies of the oo bond suggests a bond length fitting with superoxide a bond order of about 16 with superoxide being 15 xray absorption near edge structures at the iron kedge the energy shift of 5 e v between deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin as for all the methemoglobin species strongly suggests an actual local charge closer to fe 3 than fe 2 52 53 54thus the nearest formal oxidation state of iron in hbo 2 is the 3 state with oxygen in the −1 state as superoxide o 2 −  the diamagnetism in this configuration arises from the single unpaired electron on superoxide aligning antiferromagnetically with the single unpaired electron on iron in a lowspin d 5 state to give no net spin to the entire configuration in accordance with diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin from experiment 55 56the second choice of the logical possibilities above for diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin being found correct by experiment is not surprising singlet oxygen possibility 1 is an unrealistically high energy state model 3 leads to unfavorable separation of charge and does not agree with the magnetic data although it could make a minor contribution as a resonance form irons shift to a higher oxidation state in hbo 2 decreases the atoms size and allows it into the plane of the porphyrin ring pulling on the coordinated histidine residue and initiating the allosteric changes seen in the globulins early postulates by bioinorganic chemists claimed that possibility 1 above was correct and that iron should exist in oxidation state ii this conclusion seemed likely since the iron oxidation state iii as methemoglobin when not accompanied by superoxide o 2 − to hold the oxidation electron was known to render hemoglobin incapable of binding normal triplet o 2 as it occurs in the air it was thus assumed that iron remained as fe ii when oxygen gas was bound in the lungs the iron chemistry in this previous classical model was elegant but the required presence of the diamagnetic highenergy singlet oxygen molecule was never explained it was classically argued that the binding of an oxygen molecule placed highspin iron ii in an octahedral field of strongfield ligands this change in field would increase the crystal field splitting energy causing irons electrons to pair into the lowspin configuration which would be diamagnetic in fe ii this forced lowspin pairing is indeed thought to happen in iron when oxygen binds but is not enough to explain irons change in size extraction of an additional electron from iron by oxygen is required to explain both irons smaller size and observed increased oxidation state and oxygens weaker bond the assignment of a wholenumber oxidation state is a formalism as the covalent bonds are not required to have perfect bond orders involving whole electron transfer thus all three models for paramagnetic hbo 2 may contribute to some small degree by resonance to the actual electronic configuration of hbo 2 however the model of iron in hbo 2 being fe iii is more correct than the classical idea that it remains fe ii cooperativity  edita schematic visual model of oxygenbinding process showing all four monomers and hemes and protein chains only as diagrammatic coils to facilitate visualization into the molecule oxygen is not shown in this model but for each of the iron atoms it binds to the iron red sphere in the flat heme for example in the upperleft of the four hemes shown oxygen binds at the left of the iron atom shown in the upperleft of diagram this causes the iron atom to move backward into the heme that holds it the iron moves upward as it binds oxygen in this illustration tugging the histidine residue modeled as a red pentagon on the right of the iron closer as it does this in turn pulls on the protein chain holding the histidine when oxygen binds to the iron complex it causes the iron atom to move back toward the center of the plane of the porphyrin ring see moving diagram at the same time the imidazole sidechain of the histidine residue interacting at the other pole of the iron is pulled toward the porphyrin ring this interaction forces the plane of the ring sideways toward the outside of the tetramer and also induces a strain in the protein helix containing the histidine as it moves nearer to the iron atom this strain is transmitted to the remaining three monomers in the tetramer where it induces a similar conformational change in the other heme sites such that binding of oxygen to these sites becomes easier as oxygen binds to one monomer of hemoglobin the tetramers conformation shifts from the t tense state to the r relaxed state this shift promotes the binding of oxygen to the remaining three monomers heme groups thus saturating the hemoglobin molecule with oxygen 57in the tetrameric form of normal adult hemoglobin the binding of oxygen is thus a cooperative process the binding affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is increased by the oxygen saturation of the molecule with the first molecules of oxygen bound influencing the shape of the binding sites for the next ones in a way favorable for binding this positive cooperative binding is achieved through steric conformational changes of the hemoglobin protein complex as discussed above ie when one subunit protein in hemoglobin becomes oxygenated a conformational or structural change in the whole complex is initiated causing the other subunits to gain an increased affinity for oxygen as a consequence the oxygen binding curve of hemoglobin is sigmoidal or s shaped as opposed to the normal hyperbolic curve associated with noncooperative binding the dynamic mechanism of the cooperativity in hemoglobin and its relation with the lowfrequency resonance has been discussed 58binding for ligands other than oxygen  editbesides the oxygen ligand which binds to hemoglobin in a cooperative manner hemoglobin ligands also include competitive inhibitors such as carbon monoxide co and allosteric ligands such as carbon dioxide co 2 and nitric oxide no the carbon dioxide is bound to amino groups of the globin proteins to form carbaminohemoglobin this mechanism is thought to account for about 10 of carbon dioxide transport in mammals nitric oxide can also be transported by hemoglobin it is bound to specific thiol groups in the globin protein to form an snitrosothiol which dissociates into free nitric oxide and thiol again as the hemoglobin releases oxygen from its heme site this nitric oxide transport to peripheral tissues is hypothesized to assist oxygen transport in tissues by releasing vasodilatory nitric oxide to tissues in which oxygen levels are low 59competitive  editthe binding of oxygen is affected by molecules such as carbon monoxide for example from tobacco smoking exhaust gas and incomplete combustion in furnaces co competes with oxygen at the heme binding site hemoglobins binding affinity for co is 250 times greater than its affinity for oxygen 60 meaning that small amounts of co dramatically reduce hemoglobins ability to transport oxygen since carbon monoxide is a colorless odorless and tasteless gas and poses a potentially fatal threat carbon monoxide detectors have become commercially available to warn of dangerous levels in residences when hemoglobin combines with co it forms a very bright red compound called carboxyhemoglobin which may cause the skin of co poisoning victims to appear pink in death instead of white or blue when inspired air contains co levels as low as 002 headache and nausea occur if the co concentration is increased to 01 unconsciousness will follow in heavy smokers up to 20 of the oxygenactive sites can be blocked by co in similar fashion hemoglobin also has competitive binding affinity for cyanide cn −  sulfur monoxide so and sulfide s 2−  including hydrogen sulfide h 2 s all of these bind to iron in heme without changing its oxidation state but they nevertheless inhibit oxygenbinding causing grave toxicity the iron atom in the heme group must initially be in the ferrous fe 2 oxidation state to support oxygen and other gases binding and transport it temporarily switches to ferric during the time oxygen is bound as explained above initial oxidation to the ferric fe 3 state without oxygen converts hemoglobin into hem i globin or methemoglobin which cannot bind oxygen hemoglobin in normal red blood cells is protected by a reduction system to keep this from happening nitric oxide is capable of converting a small fraction of hemoglobin to methemoglobin in red blood cells the latter reaction is a remnant activity of the more ancient nitric oxide dioxygenase function of globins allosteric  editfurther information oxygenhemoglobin dissociation curve carbon di oxide occupies a different binding site on the hemoglobin carbon dioxide is more readily dissolved in deoxygenated blood facilitating its removal from the body after the oxygen has been released to tissues undergoing metabolism this increased affinity for carbon dioxide by the venous blood is known as the haldane effect through the enzyme carbonic anhydrase carbon dioxide reacts with water to give carbonic acid which decomposes into bicarbonate and protons co 2  h 2 o → h 2 co 3 → hco 3 −  h the sigmoidal shape of hemoglobins oxygendissociation curve results from cooperative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin hence blood with high carbon dioxide levels is also lower in p h more acidic  hemoglobin can bind protons and carbon dioxide which causes a conformational change in the protein and facilitates the release of oxygen protons bind at various places on the protein while carbon dioxide binds at the αamino group 61 carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin and forms carbaminohemoglobin 62 this decrease in hemoglobins affinity for oxygen by the binding of carbon dioxide and acid is known as the bohr effect the bohr effect favors the t state rather than the r state shifts the o 2 saturation curve to the right  conversely when the carbon dioxide levels in the blood decrease ie in the lung capillaries carbon dioxide and protons are released from hemoglobin increasing the oxygen affinity of the protein a reduction in the total binding capacity of hemoglobin to oxygen ie shifting the curve down not just to the right due to reduced p h is called the root effect this is seen in bony fish it is necessary for hemoglobin to release the oxygen that it binds if not there is no point in binding it the sigmoidal curve of hemoglobin makes it efficient in binding taking up o 2 in lungs and efficient in unloading unloading o 2 in tissues 63in people acclimated to high altitudes the concentration of 23bisphosphoglycerate 23bpg in the blood is increased which allows these individuals to deliver a larger amount of oxygen to tissues under conditions of lower oxygen tension this phenomenon where molecule y affects the binding of molecule x to a transport molecule z is called a heterotropic allosteric effect hemoglobin in organisms at high altitudes has also adapted such that it has less of an affinity for 23bpg and so the protein will be shifted more towards its r state in its r state hemoglobin will bind oxygen more readily thus allowing organisms to perform the necessary metabolic processes when oxygen is present at low partial pressures 64animals other than humans use different molecules to bind to hemoglobin and change its o 2 affinity under unfavorable conditions fish use both atp and gtp these bind to a phosphate pocket on the fish hemoglobin molecule which stabilizes the tense state and therefore decreases oxygen affinity 65 gtp reduces hemoglobin oxygen affinity much more than atp which is thought to be due to an extra hydrogen bond formed that further stabilizes the tense state 66 under hypoxic conditions the concentration of both atp and gtp is reduced in fish red blood cells to increase oxygen affinity 67a variant hemoglobin called fetal hemoglobin hb f α 2 γ 2  is found in the developing fetus and binds oxygen with greater affinity than adult hemoglobin this means that the oxygen binding curve for fetal hemoglobin is leftshifted ie a higher percentage of hemoglobin has oxygen bound to it at lower oxygen tension in comparison to that of adult hemoglobin as a result fetal blood in the placenta is able to take oxygen from maternal blood hemoglobin also carries nitric oxide no in the globin part of the molecule this improves oxygen delivery in the periphery and contributes to the control of respiration no binds reversibly to a specific cysteine residue in globin the binding depends on the state r or t of the hemoglobin the resulting snitrosylated hemoglobin influences various norelated activities such as the control of vascular resistance blood pressure and respiration no is not released in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes but transported by an anion exchanger called ae1 out of them 68types in humans  edithemoglobin variants are a part of the normal embryonic and fetal development they may also be pathologic mutant forms of hemoglobin in a population caused by variations in genetics some wellknown hemoglobin variants such as sicklecell anemia are responsible for diseases and are considered hemoglobinopathies other variants cause no detectable pathology and are thus considered nonpathological variants 69

gene and another encoding hemoglobin c hemoglobin hopkins2  a variant form of hemoglobin that is sometimes viewed in combination with hemoglobin s to produce sickle cell disease degradation in vertebrate animals  editwhen red cells reach the end of their life due to aging or defects they are removed from the circulation by the phagocytic activity of macrophages in the spleen or the liver or hemolyze within the circulation free hemoglobin is then cleared from the circulation via the hemoglobin transporter cd163 which is exclusively expressed on monocytes or macrophages within these cells the hemoglobin molecule is broken up and the iron gets recycled this process also produces one molecule of carbon monoxide for every molecule of heme degraded 71 heme degradation is one of the few natural sources of carbon monoxide in the human body and is responsible for the normal blood levels of carbon monoxide even in people breathing pure air the other major final product of heme degradation is bilirubin increased levels of this chemical are detected in the blood if red cells are being destroyed more rapidly than usual improperly degraded hemoglobin protein or hemoglobin that has been released from the blood cells too rapidly can clog small blood vessels especially the delicate blood filtering vessels of the kidneys causing kidney damage iron is removed from heme and salvaged for later use it is stored as hemosiderin or ferritin in tissues and transported in plasma by beta globulins as transferrins when the porphyrin ring is broken up the fragments are normally secreted as a yellow pigment called bilirubin which is secreted into the intestines as bile intestines metabolise bilirubin into urobilinogen urobilinogen leaves the body in faeces in a pigment called stercobilin globulin is metabolised into amino acids that are then released into circulation role in disease  edithemoglobin deficiency can be caused either by a decreased amount of hemoglobin molecules as in anemia or by decreased ability of each molecule to bind oxygen at the same partial pressure of oxygen hemoglobinopathies genetic defects resulting in abnormal structure of the hemoglobin molecule 72 may cause both in any case hemoglobin deficiency decreases blood oxygencarrying capacity hemoglobin deficiency is in general strictly distinguished from hypoxemia defined as decreased partial pressure of oxygen in blood 73 74 75 76 although both are causes of hypoxia insufficient oxygen supply to tissues other common causes of low hemoglobin include loss of blood nutritional deficiency bone marrow problems chemotherapy kidney failure or abnormal hemoglobin such as that of sicklecell disease the ability of each hemoglobin molecule to carry oxygen is normally modified by altered blood p h or co 2 causing an altered oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve however it can also be pathologically altered in eg carbon monoxide poisoning decrease of hemoglobin with or without an absolute decrease of red blood cells leads to symptoms of anemia anemia has many different causes although iron deficiency and its resultant iron deficiency anemia are the most common causes in the western world as absence of iron decreases heme synthesis red blood cells in iron deficiency anemia are hypochromic lacking the red hemoglobin pigment and microcytic smaller than normal other anemias are rarer in hemolysis accelerated breakdown of red blood cells associated jaundice is caused by the hemoglobin metabolite bilirubin and the circulating hemoglobin can cause renal failure some mutations in the globin chain are associated with the hemoglobinopathies such as sicklecell disease and thalassemia other mutations as discussed at the beginning of the article are benign and are referred to merely as hemoglobin variants there is a group of genetic disorders known as the porphyrias that are characterized by errors in metabolic pathways of heme synthesis king george iii of the united kingdom was probably the most famous porphyria sufferer to a small extent hemoglobin a slowly combines with glucose at the terminal valine an alpha aminoacid of each β chain the resulting molecule is often referred to as hb a 1c as the concentration of glucose in the blood increases the percentage of hb a that turns into hb a 1c increases in diabetics whose glucose usually runs high the percent hb a 1c also runs high because of the slow rate of hb a combination with glucose the hb a 1c percentage is representative of glucose level in the blood averaged over a longer time the halflife of red blood cells which is typically 50–55 days glycosylated hemoglobin is the form of hemoglobin to which glucose is bound the binding of glucose to amino acids in the hemoglobin takes place spontaneously without the help of an enzyme in many proteins and is not known to serve a useful purpose however the binding to hemoglobin does serve as a record for average blood glucose levels over the lifetime of red cells which is approximately 120 days the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin are therefore measured in order to monitor the longterm control of the chronic disease of type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm poor control of t2dm results in high levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in the red blood cells the normal reference range is approximately 4–59 though difficult to obtain values less than 7 are recommended for people with t2dm levels greater than 9 are associated with poor control of the glycosylated hemoglobin and levels greater than 12 are associated with very poor control diabetics who keep their glycosylated hemoglobin levels close to 7 have a much better chance of avoiding the complications that may accompany diabetes than those whose levels are 8 or higher 77 in addition increased glycosylation of hemoglobin increases its affinity for oxygen therefore preventing its release at the tissue and inducing a level of hypoxia in extreme cases 78elevated levels of hemoglobin are associated with increased numbers or sizes of red blood cells called polycythemia this elevation may be caused by congenital heart disease cor pulmonale pulmonary fibrosis too much erythropoietin or polycythemia vera 79 high hemoglobin levels may also be caused by exposure to high altitudes smoking dehydration artificially by concentrating hb advanced lung disease and certain tumors 41a recent study done in pondicherry india shows its importance in coronary artery disease 80diagnostic uses  editmain article hemoglobinometer a hemoglobin concentration measurement being administered before a blood donation at the american red cross boston blood donation center hemoglobin concentration measurement is among the most commonly performed blood tests usually as part of a complete blood count for example it is typically tested before or after blood donation results are reported in g  l g d l or mol l 1 gd l equals about 06206 mmoll although the latter units are not used as often due to uncertainty regarding the polymeric state of the molecule 81 this conversion factor using the single globin unit molecular weight of 16000 da is more common for hemoglobin concentration in blood for mchc mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration the conversion factor 0155 which uses the tetramer weight of 64500 da is more common 82 normal levels are men 138 to 180 gd l 138 to 180 gl or 856 to 1117 mmollwomen 121 to 151 gd l 121 to 151 gl or 751 to 937 mmollchildren 11 to 16 gd l 111 to 160 gl or 683 to 993 mmollpregnant women 11 to 14 gd l 110 to 140 gl or 683 to 869 mmoll 95 to 15 usual value during pregnancy 83 84normal values of hemoglobin in the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnant women must be at least 11 gd l and at least 105 gd l during the 2nd trimester 85dehydration or hyperhydration can greatly influence measured hemoglobin levels albumin can indicate hydration status if the concentration is below normal this is called anemia anemias are classified by the size of red blood cells the cells that contain hemoglobin in vertebrates the anemia is called microcytic if red cells are small macrocytic if they are large and normocytic otherwise hematocrit the proportion of blood volume occupied by red blood cells is typically about three times the hemoglobin concentration measured in gd l for example if the hemoglobin is measured at 17 gd l that compares with a hematocrit of 51 86laboratory hemoglobin test methods require a blood sample arterial venous or capillary and analysis on hematology analyzer and cooximeter additionally a new noninvasive hemoglobin sp hb test method called pulse cooximetry is also available with comparable accuracy to invasive methods 87concentrations of oxy and deoxyhemoglobin can be measured continuously regionally and noninvasively using nirs 88 89 90 91 92 nirs can be used both on the head and on muscles this technique is often used for research in eg elite sports training ergonomics rehabilitation patient monitoring neonatal research functional brain monitoring brain computer interface urology bladder contraction neurology neurovascular coupling and more longterm control of blood sugar concentration can be measured by the concentration of hb a 1c measuring it directly would require many samples because blood sugar levels vary widely through the day hb a 1c is the product of the irreversible reaction of hemoglobin a with glucose a higher glucose concentration results in more hb a 1c because the reaction is slow the hb a 1c proportion represents glucose level in blood averaged over the halflife of red blood cells is typically 50–55 days an hb a 1c proportion of 60 or less show good longterm glucose control while values above 70 are elevated this test is especially useful for diabetics 93the functional magnetic resonance imaging f mri machine uses the signal from deoxyhemoglobin which is sensitive to magnetic fields since it is paramagnetic combined measurement with nirs shows good correlation with both the oxy and deoxyhemoglobin signal compared to the bold signal 94athletic tracking and self tracking uses  edithemoglobin can be tracked noninvasively to build an individual data set tracking the hemoconcentration and hemodilution effects of daily activities for better understanding of sports performance and training athletes are often concerned about endurance and intensity of exercise the sensor uses lightemitting diodes that emit red and infrared light through the tissue to a light detector which then sends a signal to a processor to calculate the absorption of light by the hemoglobin protein 95 this sensor is similar to a pulse oximeter which consists of a small sensing device that clips to the finger analogues in nonvertebrate organisms  edita variety of oxygentransport and binding proteins exist in organisms throughout the animal and plant kingdoms organisms including bacteria protozoans and fungi all have hemoglobinlike proteins whose known and predicted roles include the reversible binding of gaseous ligands since many of these proteins contain globins and the heme moiety iron in a flat porphyrin support they are often called hemoglobins even if their overall tertiary structure is very different from that of vertebrate hemoglobin in particular the distinction of myoglobin and hemoglobin in lower animals is often impossible because some of these organisms do not contain muscles or they may have a recognizable separate circulatory system but not one that deals with oxygen transport for example many insects and other arthropods  in all these groups hemeglobincontaining molecules even monomeric globin ones that deal with gasbinding are referred to as oxyhemoglobins in addition to dealing with transport and sensing of oxygen they may also deal with no co 2 sulfide compounds and even o 2 scavenging in environments that must be anaerobic 96 they may even deal with detoxification of chlorinated materials in a way analogous to hemecontaining p450 enzymes and peroxidases the giant tube worm riftia pachyptila showing red hemoglobincontaining plumes the structure of hemoglobins varies across species hemoglobin occurs in all kingdoms of organisms but not in all organisms primitive species such as bacteria protozoa algae and plants often have singleglobin hemoglobins many nematode worms molluscs and crustaceans contain very large multisubunit molecules much larger than those in vertebrates in particular chimeric hemoglobins found in fungi and giant annelids may contain both globin and other types of proteins 12one of the most striking occurrences and uses of hemoglobin in organisms is in the giant tube worm  riftia pachyptila also called vestimentifera which can reach 24 meters length and populates ocean volcanic vents instead of a digestive tract these worms contain a population of bacteria constituting half the organisms weight the bacteria react with h 2 s from the vent and o 2 from the water to produce energy to make food from h 2 o and co 2 the worms end with a deepred fanlike structure plume which extends into the water and absorbs h 2 s and o 2 for the bacteria and co 2 for use as synthetic raw material similar to photosynthetic plants the structures are brightred due to their containing several extraordinarily complex hemoglobins that have up to 144 globin chains each including associated heme structures these hemoglobins are remarkable for being able to carry oxygen in the presence of sulfide and even to carry sulfide without being completely poisoned or inhibited by it as hemoglobins in most other species are 97 98other oxygenbinding proteins  editmyoglobin found in the muscle tissue of many vertebrates including humans it gives muscle tissue a distinct red or dark gray color it is very similar to hemoglobin in structure and sequence but is not a tetramer instead it is a monomer that lacks cooperative binding it is used to store oxygen rather than transport it hemocyanin the second most common oxygentransporting protein found in nature it is found in the blood of many arthropods and molluscs uses copper prosthetic groups instead of iron heme groups and is blue in color when oxygenated hemerythrin some marine invertebrates and a few species of annelid use this ironcontaining nonheme protein to carry oxygen in their blood appears pinkviolet when oxygenated clear when not chlorocruorin found in many annelids it is very similar to erythrocruorin but the heme group is significantly different in structure appears green when deoxygenated and red when oxygenated vanabins also known as vanadium chromagens they are found in the blood of sea squirts they were once hypothesized to use the rare metal vanadium as an oxygen binding prosthetic group however although they do contain vanadium by preference they apparently bind little oxygen and thus have some other function which has not been elucidated sea squirts also contain some hemoglobin they may act as toxins erythrocruorin found in many annelids including earthworms it is a giant freefloating blood protein containing many dozens—possibly hundreds—of iron and hemebearing protein subunits bound together into a single protein complex with a molecular mass greater than 35 million daltons pinnaglobin only seen in the mollusc pinna nobilis brown manganesebased porphyrin protein leghemoglobin in leguminous plants such as alfalfa or soybeans the nitrogen fixing bacteria in the roots are protected from oxygen by this iron heme containing oxygenbinding protein the specific enzyme protected is nitrogenase which is unable to reduce nitrogen gas in the presence of free oxygen coboglobin a synthetic cobaltbased porphyrin coboprotein would appear colorless when oxygenated but yellow when in veins presence in nonerythroid cells  editsome nonerythroid cells ie cells other than the red blood cell line contain hemoglobin in the brain these include the a9 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra astrocytes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and in all mature oligodendrocytes 11 it has been suggested that brain hemoglobin in these cells may enable the storage of oxygen to provide a homeostatic mechanism in anoxic conditions which is especially important for a9 da neurons that have an elevated metabolism with a high requirement for energy production 11 it has been noted further that a9 dopaminergic neurons may be at particular risk since in addition to their high mitochondrial activity they are under intense oxidative stress caused by the production of hydrogen peroxide via autoxidation andor monoamine oxidase maomediated deamination of dopamine and the subsequent reaction of accessible ferrous iron to generate highly toxic hydroxyl radicals 11 this may explain the risk of these cells for degeneration in parkinsons disease 11 the hemoglobinderived iron in these cells is not the cause of the postmortem darkness of these cells origin of the latin name substantia nigra  but rather is due to neuromelanin outside the brain hemoglobin has nonoxygencarrying functions as an antioxidant and a regulator of iron metabolism in macrophages 99 alveolar cells 100 and mesangial cells in the kidney 101in history art and music  editheart of steel hemoglobin 2005 by julian vossandreae the images show the 5foot 160 m tall sculpture right after installation after 10 days and after several months of exposure to the elements historically an association between the color of blood and rust occurs in the association of the planet mars with the roman god of war since the planet is an orangered which reminded the ancients of blood although the color of the planet is due to iron compounds in combination with oxygen in the martian soil it is a common misconception that the iron in hemoglobin and its oxides gives blood its red color the color is actually due to the porphyrin moiety of hemoglobin to which the iron is bound not the iron itself 102 although the ligation and redox state of the iron can influence the pi to pi or n to pi electronic transitions of the porphyrin and hence its optical characteristics artist julian vossandreae created a sculpture called heart of steel hemoglobin in 2005 based on the proteins backbone the sculpture was made from glass and weathering steel the intentional rusting of the initially shiny work of art mirrors hemoglobins fundamental chemical reaction of oxygen binding to iron 103 104montreal artist nicolas baier created lustre hémoglobine a sculpture in stainless steel that shows

normal halflife in individuals with abnormal rbcs whether due to abnormal hemoglobin molecules such as hemoglobin s in sickle cell anemia or rbc membrane defects – or other problems the rbc halflife is frequently shortened in these individuals an alternative test called fructosamine level can be used it measures the degree of glycation glucose binding to albumin the most common blood protein and reflects average blood glucose levels over the previous 18–21 days which is the halflife of albumin molecules in the circulation mehagnoulschipper dj van der kallen bf colier wn van der sluijs mc van
