bee sting allergy bee venom in certain cases can have very strong toxic effects on humans approximately 05 to 2 of the population is hypersensitive to insect stings but often we read reports in newspapers of 4 to 5 as well these differences come from the various methods used in population studies and what we define hypersensitivity to be however the 1 to 2 hypersensitivity ration is accepted by the medical profession in practice it is very unlikely that the hypersensitive person will get an insect sting but it can accidentally happen unfortunately during the first sting they are usually unaware of their hypersensitivity if this happens the victim can have allergic reactions which can result in an anaphylactic shock this means that the body loses its ability to protect itself from the penetrated foreign material the blood pressure of the body decreases rashes appear on the skin paleness a rapid pulse chills cold skin can follow in more serious cases there is a shortness of breath tightness of the heart faintness and eventually death can occur it is very important to remove the stinger as early as possible it is best to remove it with a pair of tweezers but if this is not at hand it can be done by scraping it with a fingernail or a tip of a knife never squeeze the venom sac of the stinger because the venom will enter the wound after it is removed lay the victim down on their back and elevate their feet if an antihistamine or cortisone product is available immediately administer it to the victim an individual who is aware that he or she is hypersensitive to bee stings should carry an insect sting treatment kit ie anakit or epipen in an emergency or lifethreatening situation it can save a persons life these kits are available through pharmacies administer the medication by following the directions of the manufacturer very carefully it is important to contact a physician and get medical attention as soon as possible the physician will further determine what kind of treatment the victim requires if someone does not know whether they are hypersensitive or not to bee stings they should get an allergy test done the physician will do a very simple skin test or a radioallergosorbent test rast the skin test is completed by the following method the physician doing the allergy test slightly scratches or pricks the surface of the skin with a needle which is dipped into bee venom dissolved in a saline solution the test solution is available in different strengths which can then determine the level of hypersensitivity depending on the reaction of the skin the physician will recommend the appropriate treatment required this will build up the immune system of the body to protect it from further bee stings
