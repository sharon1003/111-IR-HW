which the ova female reproductive cells are produced in vertebrate animals the ovary also secretes the sex hormones estrogen andprogesterone which control the development of the sexual organs and the secondary sexual characteristics click the link for more informationafter thefollicle ruptures during the release of the egg cell if fertilization does not take place the secretion of progesterone decreases and menstruation occurs if fertilization does occur progesterone is secreted during pregnancy by the placenta and acts to prevent spontaneous abortion the hormonealso prepares the mammary

animals a female sex hormone chemically progesterone is a steroidthat is synthesized in the body from cholesterol it is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of allsteroid hormones and can form in any tissues that secrete these hormones its structural formula is in humans and higher animals progesterone is primarily synthesized in the corpus luteum of theovaries the luteinizing hormone of the pituitary gland regulates its production in the bloodprogesterone mainly occurs in complexes with proteins by interacting with estriadol another female hormone progesterone regulates the estrous cycle in mammals and the menstrual cycle in humans in the preovulatory phase of the sex and reproductivecycles in women the daily production of progesterone occurs principally in the adrenal cortex andmeasures 1 to 3 mg in the postovulatory phase as much as 20 to 30 mg of progesterone areproduced principally in the corpus luteum progesterone produces changes in the uterine mucosawhich prepare the uterus for the implantation of the fertilized egg when fertilization does not occurthe corpus luteum atrophies and the secretion of progesterone decreases during a normalpregnancy the placenta participates in the required daily production of as much as 200 to 250 mg of progesterone progesterone suppresses the activity of the smooth musculature of the uterus andthus prevents spontaneous abortion of the fetus it also inhibits the ovulation of new follicles theconcentration of progesterone in the uterus decreases at the end of pregnancy which serves as one of the trigger mechanisms of childbirth in medicine progesterone and its synthetic derivatives generally called progestins or gestagensare used to treat various disturbances of pregnancy and the ovarian cycle they are also used in combination with estrogens as contraceptives derivatives of progesterone that act as repellentshave been discovered in some insects flowering plants have also been found to produceprogesterone in
