carolingian dynasty which had ruled as kings of the franks since 751 and as kings of the lombards of italy from 774 in 800 the frankish king charlemagne was crowned emperor in rome by pope leo iii in an effort to revive the roman empire in the west during a vacancy in the throne of the eastern roman empire after a civil war 840–43 following the death of emperor louis the pious the empire was divided into autonomous kingdoms with one king still recognised as emperor but with little authority outside his own kingdom the unity of the empire and the hereditary right of the carolingians continued to be acknowledged in 884 charles the fat reunited all the kingdoms for the last time but he died in 888 and the empire immediately split up with the only remaining legitimate male of the dynasty a child the nobility elected regional kings from outside the dynasty or in the case of the eastern kingdom an illegitimate carolingian the illegitimate line continued to rule in the east until 911 while in the western kingdom the legitimate carolingian dynasty was restored in 898 and ruled until 987 with an interruption from 922 to 936 the size of the empire at its inception was around 1112000 square kilometres 429000 sq mi with a population of between 10 and 20 million people 1 to the south it bordered the emirate of córdoba and after 824 the kingdom of pamplona to the north it bordered the kingdom of the danes to the west it had a short land border with brittany which was later reduced to a tributary and to the east it had a long border with the slavs and the avars who were defeated and their land incorporated into the empire in southern italy the carolingians claims to authority were disputed by the byzantines eastern romans and the vestiges of the lombard kingdom in the principality of benevento use of the term carolingian empire is a modern convention the language of official acts in the empire was latin the empire was referred to variously as universum regnum

his grandson charlemagne he was absolute ruler of virtually all of todays continental western europe north of the pyrenees only the remaining saxon realms which he partly conquered lombardy and the marca hispanica south of the pyrenees were significant additions to the frankish realms after his death martel was also the founder of all the feudal systems and merit system that marked the carolingian empire and europe in general during the middle ages though his son and grandson would gain credit for his innovations further martel cemented his place in history with his defense of christian europe against a muslim army at the battle of tours in 732 the iberian saracens had incorporated berber light horse cavalry with the heavy arab cavalry to create a formidable army that had almost never been defeated christian european forces meanwhile lacked the powerful tool of the stirrup in this victory charles earned the surname martel the hammer 3 edward gibbon the historian of

louis the pious who received aquitaine and king pepin who received italy pepin died with an illegitimate son bernard in 810 and charles died without heirs in 811 although bernard succeeded pepin as king of italy louis was made coemperor in 813 and the entire empire passed to him with charlemagnes death in the winter of 814 6reign of louis the pious and the civil war 814–843  editlouis the pious

lothar was made king of italy and coemperor pepin was made king of aquitaine and louis the german was made king of bavaria his attempts in 823 to bring his fourth son from his second marriage charles

family and louis was restored to the imperial throne when pepin died in 838 louis crowned charles king of aquitaine whilst the nobility elected pepins son pepin ii a conflict which was not resolved until 860 with pepins death when louis the pious finally died in 840 lothar claimed the entire empire irrespective of the partitions the division of 843as a result charles and louis the german went to war against lothar after losing the battle of fontenay lothar fled to his capital at aachen and raised a new army which was inferior to that of the younger brothers in the oaths of strasbourg in 842 charles and louis agreed to declare lothar unfit for the imperial throne this marked the eastwest division of the empire between louis and charles until the verdun treaty considered a milestone in european history the oaths of strasbourg symbolize the birth of both france and germany 7 the partition of carolingian empire was finally settled in 843 by and between louis the pious three sons in

him coemperor in 850 lothar died in 855 dividing his kingdom into three parts the territory already held by louis remained his the territory of the former kingdom of burgundy was granted to his third son charles of burgundy and the remaining territory for which there was no traditional name was granted to his second son lothar ii whose realm was named lotharingia louis ii dissatisfied with having received no additional territory upon his fathers death allied with his uncle louis the german against his brother lothar and his uncle charles the bald in 858 lothar reconciled with his brother and uncle shortly after charles was so unpopular that he could not raise an army to fight the invasion and instead fled to burgundy he was only saved when the bishops refused to crown louis the german king in 860 charles the bald invaded charles of burgundys kingdom but was repulsed lothar ii ceded lands to louis ii in 862 for support of a divorce from his wife which caused repeated conflicts with the pope and his uncles charles of burgundy died in 863 and his kingdom was inherited by louis ii lothar ii died in 869 with no legitimate heirs and his kingdom was divided between charles the bald

charlemagne charles suffering what is believed to be epilepsy could not secure the kingdom against viking raiders and after buying their withdrawal from paris in 886 was perceived by the court as being cowardly and incompetent the following year his nephew arnulf of carinthia the illegitimate son of king carloman of bavaria raised the standard of rebellion instead of fighting the insurrection

of charlemagne in the decades around the year 800 in this year charlemagne was crowned emperor and adapted his existing royal administration to live up to the expectations of his new title the political reforms wrought in aachen were to have an immense impact on the political definition of western europe for the rest of the middle ages the carolingian improvements on the old merovingian mechanisms of governance have been lauded by historians for the increased central control efficient bureaucracy accountability and cultural renaissance the carolingian empire was the largest western territory since the fall of rome but historians have come to suspect the depth of the emperors influence and control legally the carolingian emperor exercised the bannum the right to rule and command over all of his territories also he had supreme jurisdiction in judicial matters made legislation led the army and protected both the church and the poor his administration was an attempt to organize the kingdom church and nobility around him however its efficacy was directly dependent upon the efficiency loyalty and support of his subjects military  editit has long been held that the dominance of the carolingian military was based on a  cavalry revolution led by charles martel in 730 however the stirrup which made the shock cavalry lance charge possible was not introduced to the frankish kingdom until the late eighth century 13 instead the carolingian military success rested primarily on novel siege technologies and excellent logistics 14 however large numbers of horses were used by the frankish military during the age of charlemagne this was because horses provided a quick longdistance method of transporting troops which was critical to building and maintaining such a large empire 13capitals  editinterior of the palatine chapel in aachen no permanent capital city existed in the empire the itinerant court being a typical characteristic of all western european kingdoms at this time some main residences can however be distinguished in the first year of his reign charlemagne went to aachen  french aixlachapelle italian aquisgrana for the first time he began to build a palace twenty years later 788 the palace chapel constructed in 796 later became aachen cathedral charlemagne spent most winters between 800 and his death 814 at aachen which he made the joint capital with rome in order to enjoy the hot springs charlemagne organized his empire into 350 counties each led by an appointed count counts served as judges administrators and enforcers of capitularies to enforce loyalty he set up the system of missi dominici meaning envoys of the lord in this system one representative of the church and one representative of the emperor would head to the different counties every year and report back to charlemagne on their status household  editsee also royal household under the merovingians and carolingians the royal household was an itinerant body until c 802 which moved around the kingdom making sure good government was upheld in the localities the most important positions were the chaplain who was responsible for all ecclesiastical affairs in the kingdom and the count of the palace  count palatine who had supreme control over the household it also included more minor officials eg chamberlain seneschal and marshal the household sometimes led the army eg seneschal andorf against the bretons in 786 possibly associated with the chaplain and the royal chapel was the office of the chancellor head of the chancery a nonpermanent writing office the charters produced were rudimentary and mostly to do with land deeds there are 262 surviving from charles’ reign as opposed to 40 from pepin ’s and 350 from louis the pious officials  editthere are 3 main offices which enforced carolingian authority in the localities the comes  latin count  appointed by charles to administer a county the carolingian empire except bavaria was divided up into between 110 and 600 counties each divided into centenae which were under the control of a vicar at first they were royal agents sent out by charles but after c 802 they were important local magnates they were responsible for justice enforcing capitularies levying soldiers receiving tolls and dues and maintaining roads and bridges they could technically be dismissed by the king but many offices became hereditary they were also sometimes corrupt although many were exemplary eg count eric of friuli provincial governors eventually evolved who supervised several counts the missi dominici  latin dominical emissaries  originally appointed ad hoc a reform in 802 led to the office of missus dominicus becoming a permanent one the missi dominici were sent out in pairs one was an ecclesiastic and one secular their status as high officials were thought to safeguard them from the temptation of taking bribes they made four journeys a year in their local missaticum each lasting a month and were responsible for making the royal will and capitularies known judging cases and occasionally raising armies the vassi dominici these were the king’s vassals and were usually the sons of powerful men holding ‘benefices’ and forming a contingent in the royal army they also went on ad hoc missions legal system  editaround 780 charlemagne reformed the local system of administering justice and created the scabini professional experts on the law every count had the help of seven of these scabini who were supposed to know every national law so that all men could be judged according to it judges were also banned from taking bribes and were supposed to use sworn inquests to establish facts in 802 all law was written down and amended the salic law was also amended in both 798 and 802 although even einhard admits in section 29 that this was imperfect judges were supposed to have a copy of both the salic law code and the ripuarian law code coinage  edita denarius minted by prince adelchis of benevento in the name of emperor louis ii and empress engelberga showing the expansion of carolingian authority in southern italy which louis achieved coinage had a strong association with the roman empire and charlemagne took up its regulation with his other imperial duties the carolingians exercised controls over the silver coinage of the realm controlling its composition and value the name of the emperor not of the minter appeared on the coins charlemagne worked to suppress mints in northern germany on the baltic sea subdivision  editthe frankish kingdom was subdivided by charlemagne into three separate areas to make administration easier these were the inner core of the kingdom austrasia neustria and burgundy which were supervised directly by the missatica system and the itinerant household outside this was the regna where frankish administration rested upon the counts and outside this was the marcher areas where ruled powerful governors these marcher lordships were present in brittany spain and bavaria charles also created two subkingdoms in aquitaine and italy ruled by his sons louis and pepin respectively bavaria was also under the command of an autonomous governor gerold until his death in 796 while charles still had overall authority in these areas they were fairly autonomous with their own chancery and minting facilities placitum generalis  editmain article placitum the annual meeting the placitum generalis or marchfield was held every year between march and may at a place appointed by the king it was called for three reasons to gather the frankish host to go on a campaign to discuss political and ecclesiastical matters affecting the kingdom and to legislate for them and to make judgments all important men had to go the meeting and so it was an important way for charles to make his will known originally the meeting worked effectively however later it merely became a forum for discussion and for nobles to express their dissatisfaction oaths  editthe oath of fidelity was a way for charles to ensure loyalty from all his subjects as early as 779 he banned sworn guilds between other men so that everyone took an oath of loyalty only to him in 789 in response to the 786 rebellion he began legislating that everyone should swear fidelity to him as king however in 802 he expanded the oath greatly and made it so that all men over age 12 swore it to him capitularies  editthe five greatest capitularies of charlemagne’s reign are the capitulary of herstal of 779 this is a short capitulary and launched according to ganshof in response to a crisis in aquitaine italy and spain it is concerned a lot with ordo making sure that the church is working correctly also with reinforcing the wergild and frankish ideals notably forced the usage of tithes admonitio generalis of 789 “blueprint for a new society” mentioning social issues for the first time the first 58 clauses of 82 reiterate decisions made by previous church councils and much is also to do with ordo the capitulary of frankfurt of 794 this is mainly to do with theology and speaks out against adoptionism and iconoclasm the programmatic capitulary of 802 this shows an increasing sense of vision in society the capitulary for the jews of 814 delineating the prohibitions of jews engaging in commerce or moneylending list of emperors  editthis table shows only those carolingians
