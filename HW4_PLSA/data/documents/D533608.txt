gingival recession from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search1 total loss of attachment clinical attachment loss cal is the sum of 2 gingival recession and 3 probing depth gingival recession also known as receding gums is the exposure in the roots of the teeth caused by a loss of gum tissue andor retraction of the gingival margin from the crown of the teeth 1 gum recession is a common problem in adults over the age of 40 but it may also occur starting from the age of a teenager or around the age of 10 it may exist with or without concomitant decrease in crowntoroot ratio

been proposed to classify gingival recession miller’s classification system 2 being the one that is most widely followed many cases which are encountered in daily clinical practice cannot be classified according to the criteria of the present classification systems kumar  masamattis classification system gives a comprehensive depiction of recession defect that can be used to include cases that cannot be classified according to present classifications a separate classification system for palatal recessions pr has been given a new comprehensive classification system classifies recession on the basis of the position of interdental papilla and buccallingualpalatal recessions kumar  masamattis classification system tries to overcome the limitations of millers classification 3causes  editthere are many possible causes for gingival recession by far the most common cause is gum disease  periodontal disease  1  not in citation givenoveraggressive brushing is often assumed to cause gum recession 1 however a systematic review of the literature concludes that the data to support or refute the association between tooth brushing and gingival recession are inconclusive 4 a subsequent study found horizontal tooth brushing technique versus bass technique or circular methods mediumhardness toothbrush use and brushing only once daily were associated with gingival recession 5improper flossing ie flossing too roughly or aggressively which may cut into the gums 6hereditary thin fragile or insufficient gingival tissue predisposes to gingival recession 1dipping tobacco which affects the mucous membrane lining in the mouth and will cause receding gums over time selfinflicted trauma such as habits like digging a fingernail or pencil into the gum this type of recession more commonly associated with children and persons with psychiatric disorders scurvy lack of dietary vitamin cacute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis abnormal tooth position such as tooth crowding giving inadequate cover of one or more teeth by the jaw bone 1piercings in the lip or tongue that wear away the gum by rubbing against it intentional gingival retraction for example the adult tooth may not grow out of the gum and to remedy this a procedure called an exposure is done it involves the gum tissue being cut open to allow the adult tooth to grow out this is a less common cause of gum recession symptoms  editgum recession is generally not an acute condition in most cases receding of gums is a progressive condition that occurs gradually over the years this is one reason that it is common over the age of 40 because the changes in the condition of the gums from one day to another are minimal patients get used to the gums appearance and tend not to notice the recession visually receding gums may remain unnoticed until the condition starts to cause symptoms advanced gingival recession note particularly severe recession on leftmost incisor the following signs and symptoms may indicate gum recession tooth mobility dentin hypersensitivity oversensitive teeth  short sharp pain is triggered by hot cold sweet sour or spicy food and drink if the cementum covering the root is not protected anymore by the gums it is easily abraded exposing the dentin tubules to external stimuli teeth may also appear longer than normal a larger part of the crown is visible if gums are recedingthe roots of the tooth are exposed and visible the tooth feels notched at the gum line change in the tooth’s color due to the color difference between enamel and cementumspaces between teeth seem to grow the space is the same but it seems larger because the gums do not fill it any morecavities below the gum line if the gum recession is caused by gingivitis the following symptoms may also be present puffy red or swollen inflamed gums gum bleeding while brushing or flossing bad breath  halitosisin some cases it is the treatment of gingivitis that reveals a gum recession problem that was previously masked by the gums swelling gingival grafting  editmain article gum graft depending on the shape of the gum recession and the levels of bone around the teeth areas of gum recession can be regenerated with new gum tissue using a variety of gum grafting  periodontal plastic surgery  procedures performed by a specialist in periodontics a periodontist  these procedures are typically completed under local anesthesia with or without conscious sedation as the patient prefers this may involve repositioning of adjacent gum tissue to cover the recession called a pedicle graft or use of a free graft of gingival or connective tissue from the roof of the mouth called a free gingival graft or a subepithelial connective tissue graft  alternatively a material called acellular dermal matrix processed donated human skin allograft may be used instead of tissue from the patients own palate growthfactor techniques  editrecent advances have seen the introduction of platelet derived growth factor pdgf infused bone graft material this material is usually combined with the cellular matrix to form a soft bone paste that is then covered by the allograft the development of this type of bone and tissue cellular matrix also known as ortho filler results in greater osseointegration with the patients healthy bone and soft tissue healing from such procedures requires 2–4 weeks after a few months the results can be evaluated and in some cases the new tissue needs to be reshaped in a very minor procedure to get an optimal result in cases where recession is not accompanied by periodontal bone loss complete or near complete coverage of the recession area is achievable  citation needed references  edit a b c d e gingival recession  causes and treatment archived 20100917 at the wayback machine
