sold more than 13 million copies according to nielsen data elvis blue christmas is the 15th best selling christmas song of the sound scan era after 2003 irving berlin described elvis version of white christmas as a profane parody of his cherished yuletide standard and tried to get the song blacklisted by radio stations across the us in graceland the christmas decorations stay up from thanksgiving until elvis birthday on january 8th in 1958 elvis was with the us army in germany he helped german troops decorate the tree and then on request sang silent night while blue christmas might be it for most people when it comes to elvis christmas songs it is worth noting that the king’s chrismas album elvis christmas album is now the unchallenged bestselling holiday album of all time released in november 1957 it was primarily blues in direction though the first moments of opening track ‘santa claus is back in town’ might have you thinking that an album of barbershop awaits as seems to be the way things were done back then the album was neatly split into one side of secular numbers and a flipside that was religious in nature so the bar room grit of santa claus is back in town is a complete counterpoint to elvis’ ‘o little town of bethlehem’ which appears just 6 tracks later‘elvis’ christmas album’ featured 2 original songs the aforementioned ‘santa claus is back in town’ and the swinging ‘santa bring my baby back to me’ which had the swagger of a true elvis original elsewhere presley turned out seminal renditions of old chestnuts like ‘i’ll be home for christmas’ ‘here comes santa claus right down santa claus lane’ and ‘white christmas’ the latter sparked something inside the song’s composer irving berlin to such an extent that he sought for the radio stations around the states to blacklist elvis’ version in favour of bing crosby’s original quite how he could have thought that elvis has desecrated the standard is hard to understand now but berlin was truly vehement in his opposition thankfully he lost that particular battle though elvis’ ‘white christmas’ does not get as much attention each december as his big christmas number ‘blue christmas’ elvis was by no means the first artist to record the billy hayes and jay w johnson song ernst tubb and doye odell got in almost a decade before him but it is his delightfully lumbering rock and roll version that remains the most popular version two thirds of the 6 tracks that made up side two vinyl speak of ‘elvis’ christmas album’ had been released earlier in 1957 on an elvis ep called ‘peace in the valley’ although overtly religious so not out of place on a christmas album songs such as ‘take my hand precious lord’ and ‘ there’ll be peace in the valley for me could have fitted onto any elvis album and not necessarily a christmas one doesn’t make them any less enjoyable but for the time of year that’s in it his ‘silent night’ does sound particularly inspiring as the snow gently falls outside‘elvis’ christmas album’ would get rereleased on several occasions throughout the 1960’s and 1970’s the most significant of which came in the early 1970’s when the ‘peace in the valley’ ep tracks were removed and replaced with new song ‘if every day was like christmas’ and a song from the same recording session called ‘mama like the roses’ which in itself was not a christmas song ‘if every day was like christmas’ was a homily to the season sung by an elvis at his most melancholy the tenet of his argument was that if every day was like christmas all the ills of the world could be wiped out instantly hard to argue with isn’t it but pity the poor domestic fowl who would have to suffer an all year round sense of dread released 14 years after his eponymous christmas album elvis sings the wonderful world of christmas was the second and only other dedicated christmas album that elvis recorded although it never reached the heights of ‘elvis’ christmas album’ there is much to savor on this record it opened with 2 carols ‘o come all ye faithful’ and ‘the first noel’ which were slightly more laidback that one might have expected from elvis if anything they were a tad flat and slightly devoid of his usual charisma luckily things do pick up considerably on the 9 secular tracks that followed in their wake although restrained there is an easy charm to ‘on a snowy christmas night’ ‘the wonderful world of christmas’ is a perfect family affair ‘holly leaves and christmas trees’ is the album’s heartbreaker and ‘merry christmas baby’ is elvis at the peak of his rhythm and blues incarnation ‘i’ll be home for christmas’ may have also appeared on the original elvis christmas album but his cover of bing crosby’s song is hard to resist no matter how many times you hear it elvis christmas album rca
