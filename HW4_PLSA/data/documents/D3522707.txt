fifa 17 top 3 rated players are ronaldo messi and neymar but whos coming out on top fifa 17s top 504th rated players have been revealed now fans are waiting to discover the 31st ratings between cristiano ronaldo lionel messi an neymar0by tom hutchison  james wright  published 2nd september 2016easportswhich of these three fantastic players will come out on top fifa 17 has revealed the top 50  4th placed players and now fans are just waiting to discover the stats for the top three and more importantly who between cristiano ronaldo lionel messi an neymar will come third second and first in the ratings last year lionel messi was top with an overall ranking of 94 ronaldo was just behind in second at 93 and neymar was ultimately third three points behind on 90 but having had an incredibly year which saw ronaldo win the champions league with real madrid and the euros in france with portugal youd be hard pushed to bet against the madrid man finally claim the top spot for the game after winning europe’s golden shoe this year luis suarez was only good enough to claim the fourth spot in the list with a rating of 90 so if we were going to bet wed say that after winning olympic gold in rio neymar could go up a point to 91 former fifa cover star messi could drop to 92 while ronaldo could likely keep the same rating as last year but come out on top only time will tell but we suspect
