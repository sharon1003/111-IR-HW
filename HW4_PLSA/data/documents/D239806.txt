between circa 2050 bc and 1710 bc stretching from the reunification of egypt under the impulse of mentuhotep ii of the eleventh dynasty to the end of the twelfth dynasty some scholars also include the thirteenth dynasty of egypt wholly into this period as well in which case the middle kingdom would finish c 1650 while others only include it until merneferre ay c 1700 bc last king of this dynasty to

kingdom egypt entered a period of weak pharaonic power and decentralization called the first intermediate period 2 towards the end of this period two rival dynasties known in egyptology as the tenth and eleventh fought for power over the entire country the theban 11th dynasty only ruled southern egypt from the first cataract to the tenth nome of upper egypt 3 to the north lower egypt was ruled by the rival 10th dynasty from herakleopolis 3 the struggle was to be concluded by mentuhotep ii who ascended the theban throne in 2055 b c 4 during mentuhotep iis fourteenth regnal year he took advantage of a revolt in the thinite nome to launch an attack on herakleopolis which met little resistance 3 after toppling the last rulers of the 10th dynasty mentuhotep began consolidating his power over all egypt a process which he finished by his 39th regnal year 2 for this reason mentuhotep ii is regarded as the founder of the middle kingdom 5mentuhotep ii commanded military campaigns south as far as the second cataract in nubia which had gained its independence during the first intermediate period he also restored egyptian hegemony over the sinai region which had been lost to egypt since the end of the old kingdom 6 to consolidate his authority he restored the cult of the ruler depicting himself as a god in his own lifetime wearing the headdresses of amun and min 7 he died after a reign of 51 years and passed the throne to his son mentuhotep iii 6mentuhotep iii reigned for only twelve years during which he continued consolidating theban rule over the whole of egypt building a series of forts in the eastern delta region to secure egypt against threats from asia 6 he also sent the first expedition to punt during the middle kingdom by means of ships constructed at the end of wadi hammamat on the red sea 8 mentuhotep iii was succeeded by mentuhotep iv whose name significantly is omitted from all ancient egyptian king lists 9 the turin papyrus claims that after mentuhotep iii came seven kingless years 10 despite this absence his reign is attested from a few inscriptions in wadi hammamat that record expeditions to the red sea coast and to quarry stone for the royal monuments 9 the leader of this expedition was his vizier amenemhat who is widely assumed to be the future pharaoh amenemhet i the first king of the 12th dynasty 11 12mentuhotep ivs absence from the king lists has prompted the theory that amenemhet i usurped his throne 12 while there are no contemporary accounts of this struggle certain circumstantial evidence may point to the existence of a civil war at the end of the 11th dynasty 9 inscriptions left by one nehry the hatya of hermopolis suggest that he was attacked at a place called shedyetsha by the forces of the reigning king but his forces prevailed khnumhotep i an official under amenemhet i claims to have participated in a flotilla of 20 ships to pacify upper egypt donald redford has suggested these events should be interpreted as evidence of open war between two dynastic claimants 13 what is certain is that however he came to power amenemhet i was not of royal birth 12early 12th dynasty  editmain article twelfth dynasty of egypt the head of a statue of senusret i from the 12th dynasty onwards pharaohs often kept welltrained standing armies which included nubian contingents these formed the basis of larger forces which were raised for defence against invasion or for expeditions up the nile or across the sinai however the middle kingdom was basically defensive in its military strategy with fortifications built at the first cataract of the nile in the delta and across the sinai isthmus 14early in his reign amenemhet i was compelled to campaign in the delta region which had not received as much attention as upper egypt during the 11th dynasty 15 in addition he strengthened defenses between egypt and asia building the walls of the ruler in the east delta region 16 perhaps in response to this perpetual unrest amenemhat i built a new capital for egypt in the north known as amenemhet itj tawy or amenemhet seizer of the two lands 17 the location of this capital is unknown but is presumably near the citys necropolis the presentday ellisht 16 like mentuhotep ii amenemhet bolstered his claim to authority with propaganda 18 in particular the prophecy of neferty dates to about this time which purports to be an oracle of an old kingdom priest who predicts a king amenemhet i arising from the far south of egypt to restore the kingdom after centuries of chaos 16propaganda notwithstanding amenemhet never held the absolute power commanded in theory by the old kingdom pharaohs during the first intermediate period the governors of the nomes of egypt nomarchs gained considerable power 19 their posts had become hereditary and some nomarchs entered into marriage alliances with the nomarchs of neighboring nomes 19 to strengthen his position amenemhet required registration of land modified nome borders and appointed nomarchs directly when offices became vacant but acquiesced to the nomarch system probably in order to placate the nomarchs who supported his rule 20 this gave the middle kingdom a more feudal organization than egypt had before or would have afterward 21in his 20th regnal year amenemhat established his son senusret i as his coregent 21 establishing a practice which would be used repeatedly throughout the rest of the middle kingdom and again during the new in amenemhets 30th regnal year he was presumably murdered in a palace conspiracy senusret campaigning against libyan invaders rushed home to itjtawy to prevent a takeover of the government 22 during his reign he continued the practice of directly appointing nomarchs 23 and undercut the autonomy of local priesthoods by building at cult centers throughout egypt 24 under his rule egyptian armies pushed south into nubia as far as the second cataract building a border fort at buhen and incorporating all of lower nubia as an egyptian colony 25 to the west he consolidated his power over the oases and extended commercial contacts into syriopalestine as far as ugarit 26 in his 43rd regnal year senusret appointed amenemhet ii as junior coregent and died in his 46th 27the reign of amenemhat ii has been often characterized as largely peaceful 26 but record of his genut or daybooks have cast doubt on that assessment 28 among these records preserved on temple walls at tod and memphis are descriptions of peace treaties with certain syriopalestinian cities and military conflict with others 28 to the south amenemhet sent a campaign through lower nubia to inspect wawat 26 it does not appear that amenemhet continued his predecessors policy of appointing nomarchs but let it become hereditary again 23 another expedition to punt dates to his reign 28 in his 33rd regnal year he appointed his son senusret ii coregent 29evidence for military activity of any kind during the reign of senusret ii is nonexistent 30 senusret instead appears to have focused on domestic issues particularly the irrigation of the faiyum this multigenerational project aimed to convert the faiyum oasis into a productive swath of farmland 30 senusret eventually placed his pyramid at the site of ellahun near the junction of the nile and the fayuums major irrigation canal the bahr yussef 31 he reigned only fifteen years 32 which is evidenced by the incomplete nature of many of his constructions 30 his son senusret iii succeeded him height of the middle kingdom  editstatue head of senusret iiisenusret iii was a warriorking often taking to the field himself in his sixth year he redredged an old kingdom canal around the first cataract to facilitate travel to upper nubia 33 he used this to launch a series of brutal campaigns in nubia in his sixth eighth tenth and sixteenth years 33 after his victories senusret built a series of massive forts throughout the country to establish the formal boundary between egyptian conquests and unconquered nubia at semna 33 the personnel of these forts were charged to send frequent reports to the capital on the movements and activities of the local medjay natives some of which survive revealing how tightly the egyptians intended to control the southern border 34 medjay were not allowed north of the border by ship nor could they enter by land with their flocks but they were permitted to travel to local forts in order to trade 35 after this senusret sent one more campaign in his 19th year but turned back due to abnormally low nile levels which endangered his ships 33 one of senusrets soldiers also records a campaign into palestine perhaps against shechem the only reference to a military campaign against a location in palestine from the entirety of middle kingdom literature 36domestically senusret has been given credit for an administrative reform which put more power in the hands of appointees of the central government instead of regional authorities 33 egypt was divided into three waret or administrative divisions north south and head of the south perhaps lower egypt most of upper egypt and the nomes of the original theban kingdom during the war with herakleopolis respectively 37 each region was administrated by a reporter second reporter some kind of council the djadjat  and a staff of minor officials and scribes 37 the power of the nomarchs seems to drop off permanently during his reign which has been taken to indicate that the central government had finally suppressed them though there is no record that senusret ever took direct action against them 33senusret iii had a lasting legacy as a warrior pharaoh his name was hellenized by later greek historians as sesostris a name which was then given to a conflation of senusret and several new kingdom warrior pharaohs 38 in nubia senusret was worshiped as a patron god by egyptian settlers 39 the duration of his reign remains something of an open question his son amenemhet iii began reigning after senusrets 19th regnal year which has been widely considered senusrets highest attested date 40 however a reference to a year 39 on a fragment found in the construction debris of senusrets mortuary temple has suggested the possibility of a long coregency with his son 41the reign of amenemhat iii was the height of middle kingdom economic prosperity his reign is remarkable for the degree to which egypt exploited its resources mining camps in the sinai which had previously been used only by intermittent expeditions were operated on a semipermanent basis as evidenced by the construction of houses walls and even local cemeteries 42 there are 25 separate references to mining expeditions in the sinai and four to expeditions in wadi hammamat one of which had over 2000 workers 43 amenemhet reinforced his fathers defenses in nubia 44 and continued the faiyum land reclamation system 45 after a reign of 45 years amenemhet iii was succeeded by amenemhet iv 42 whose nineyear reign is poorly attested 46 clearly by this time dynastic power began to weaken for which several explanations have been proposed contemporary records of the nile flood levels indicate that the end of the reign of amenemhet iii was dry and crop failures may have helped to destabilize the dynasty 45 further amenemhet iii had an inordinately long reign which tends to create succession problems 47 the latter argument perhaps explains why amenemhet iv was succeeded by sobekneferu the first historically attested female king of egypt 47 sobekneferu ruled no more than four years 48 and as she apparently had no heirs when she died the twelfth dynasty came to a sudden end as did the golden age of the middle kingdom decline into the second intermediate period  edita kneeling statue of sobekhotep v one of the pharaohs from the declining years of the middle kingdom after the death of sobeknefru the throne may have passed to sekhemre khutawy sobekhotep 49 50 though in older studies wegaf who had previously been the great overseer of troops 51 was thought to have reigned next 52 beginning with this reign egypt was ruled by a series of ephemeral kings for about ten to fifteen years 53 ancient egyptian sources regard these as the first kings of the thirteenth dynasty though the term dynasty is misleading as most kings of the thirteenth dynasty were not related 54 the names of these shortlived kings are attested on a few monuments and graffiti and their succession order is only known from the turin canon although even this is not fully trusted 53after the initial dynastic chaos a series of longer reigning better attested kings ruled for about fifty to eighty years 53 the strongest king of this period neferhotep i ruled for eleven years and maintained effective control of upper egypt nubia and the delta 55 with the possible exceptions of xois and avaris 56 neferhotep i was even recognized as the suzerain of the ruler of byblos indicating that the thirteenth dynasty was able to retain much of the power of the twelfth dynasty at least up to his reign 56 at some point during the 13th dynasty xois and avaris began governing themselves 56 the rulers of xois being the fourteenth dynasty and the asiatic rulers of avaris being the hyksos of the fifteenth dynasty according to manetho this latter revolt occurred during the reign of neferhoteps successor sobekhotep iv though there is no archaeological evidence 57 sobekhotep iv was succeeded by the short reign of sobekhotep v who was followed by wahibre ibiau then merneferre ai wahibre ibiau ruled ten years and merneferre ai ruled for twenty three years the longest of any thirteenth dynasty king but neither of these two kings left as many attestations as either neferhotep or sobekhotep iv 58 despite this they both seem to have held at least parts of lower egypt after merneferre ai however no king left his name on any object found outside the south 58 this begins the final portion of the thirteenth dynasty when southern kings continue to reign over upper egypt but when the unity of egypt fully disintegrated the middle kingdom gave way to the second intermediate period 59administration  editwhen the eleventh dynasty reunified egypt it had to create a centralized administration such as had not existed in egypt since the downfall of the old kingdom government to do this it appointed people to positions which had fallen out of use in the decentralized first intermediate period highest among these was the vizier 60 the vizier was the chief minister for the king handling all the daytoday business of government in the kings place 60 this was a monumental task therefore it would often be split into two positions a vizier of the north and a vizier of the south it is uncertain how often this occurred during the middle kingdom but senusret i clearly had two simultaneously functioning viziers 60 other positions were inherited from the provincial form of government at thebes used by the eleventh dynasty before the reunification of egypt 61 the overseer of sealed goods became the countrys treasurer and the overseer of the estate became the kings chief steward 61 these three positions and the scribe of the royal document probably the kings personal scribe appear to be the most important posts of the central government judging by the monument count of those in these positions 61beside this many old kingdom posts which had lost their original meaning and become mere honorifics were brought back into the central government 60 only highranking officials could claim the title member of the elite which had been applied liberally during the first intermediate period 61this basic form of administration continued throughout the middle kingdom though there is some evidence for a major reform of the central government under senusret iii records from his reign indicate that upper and lower egypt were divided into separate waret and governed by separate administrators 23 administrative documents and private stele indicate a proliferation of new bureaucratic titles around this time which have been taken as evidence of a larger central government 62 governance of the royal residence was moved into a separate division of government 23 the military was placed under the control of a chief general 23 however it is possible that these titles and positions were much older and simply were not recorded on funerary stele due to religious conventions 62provincial government  editclay model of a middle kingdom house musée du louvre decentralization during the first intermediate period left the individual egyptian provinces or nomes under the control of powerful families who held the hereditary title of great chief of the nome or nomarch 63 this position developed during the fifth and sixth dynasties when the various powers of old kingdom provincial officials began to be exercised by a single individual 63 at roughly this time the provincial aristocracy began building elaborate tombs for themselves which have been taken as evidence of the wealth and power which these rulers had acquired as nomarchs 63 by the end of the first intermediate period some nomarchs ruled their nomes as minor potentates such as the nomarch nehry of hermopolis who dated inscriptions by his own regnal year 60when the eleventh dynasty came to power it was necessary to subdue the power of the nomarchs if egypt was to be reunified under a central government the first major steps towards that end took place under amenemhet i amenemhet made the city not the nome the center of administration and only the hatya or mayor of the larger cities would be permitted to carry the title of nomarch 23 the title of nomarch continued to be used until the reign of senusret iii 23 as did the elaborate tombs indicative of their power after which they suddenly disappear 64 this has been interpreted several ways traditionally it has been believed that senusret iii took some action to suppress the nomarch families during his reign 65 recently other interpretations have been proposed detlef franke has argued that senusret ii adopted a policy of educating the sons of nomarchs in the capital and appointing them to government posts in this way many provincial families may have been bled dry of scions 23 also while the title of great overlord of the nome disappeared other distinctive titles of the nomarchs remained during the first intermediate period individuals holding the title of great overlord also often held the title of overseer of priests 66 in the late middle kingdom there exist families holding the titles of mayor and overseer of priests as hereditary possessions 64 therefore it has been argued that the great nomarch families were never subdued but were simply absorbed into the pharaonic administration of the country 64 while it is true that the large tombs indicative of nomarchs disappear at the end of the twelfth dynasty grand royal tombs also disappear soon thereafter due to general instability surrounding the decline of the middle kingdom 64agriculture and climate  editit was i who brought forth grain the grain god loved methe nile adored me from his every sourceone did not hunger during my years did not thirstthey sat content with all my deeds remembering me fondlyand i set each thing firmly in its place 67extract from the instructions of amenemhat throughout the history of ancient egypt the annual flooding of the nile river to inundate the fields on its banks was relied upon to feed the population there is evidence that the collapse of the previous old kingdom may have been due in part to low flood levels resulting in famine 68 this trend appears to have been reversed during the early years of the middle kingdom with relatively high water levels recorded for much of this era with an average inundation of 19 meters above its nonflood levels 69 the years of repeated high inundation levels correspond to the most prosperous period of the middle kingdom which occurred during the reign of amenemhat iii 70 this seems to be confirmed in some of the literature of the period such as in the instructions of amenemhat where the king tells his son how agriculture prospered under his reign 67art  edithead and torso of a noblewoman ca 1844–1837 b c e 591 brooklyn museum one of the innovations in sculpture that occurred during the middle kingdom was the block statue which would continue to be popular through to the ptolemaic age almost 2000 years later 71 block statues consist of a man squatting with his knees drawn up to his chest and his arms folded on top his knees often these men are wearing a wide cloak that reduces the body of the figure to a simple blocklike shape 72 most of the detail is reserved for the head of the individual being depicted in some instances the modeling of the limbs has been retained by the sculptor 73 there are two basic types of block statues ones with the feet completely covered by the cloak and ones with the feet uncovered 74this statue to the right speaks well for the equality of gender in ancient egypt that a private lady could have a sculpture made for herself the heavy tripartite wig frames the broad face and passes behind the ears thus giving the impression of forcing them forward they are large in keeping with the ancient egyptian ideal of beauty the same ideal required small breasts and also in this respect the sculpture is no exception whereas the natural curve of the eyebrows dips towards the root of the nose the artificial eyebrows in low relief are absolutely straight above the inner corners of the eyes a feature which places the bust early in dynasty xii around 1900 b c these artificial eyebrows too began to follow the natural curve and dipped toward the nose 75literature  editrichard b parkinson and ludwig d morenz write that ancient egyptian literature—narrowly defined as belleslettres beautiful writing—were not recorded in written form until the early twelfth dynasty of the middle kingdom 76 old kingdom texts served mainly to maintain the divine cults preserve souls in the afterlife and document accounts for practical uses in daily life it was not until the middle kingdom that texts were written for the purpose of entertainment and intellectual curiosity 77 parkinson and morenz also speculate that written works of the middle kingdom were transcriptions of the oral literature of the old kingdom 78 it is known that some oral poetry was preserved in later writing for example litterbearers songs were preserved as written verses in tomb inscriptions of the old kingdom 77it is also thought that the growth of the middle class and a growth in the number of scribes needed for the expanded bureaucracy under senusret ii helped spur the development of middle kingdom literature 48 later ancient egyptians considered the literature from this time as classic 48 stories such as the tale of the shipwrecked sailor and the story of sinuhe were composed during this period and were popular enough to be widely copied afterwards 48 many philosophical works were also created at this time including the dispute between a man and his ba where an unhappy man converses with his soul the satire of the trades in which the role of the scribe is praised above all other jobs and the magic
