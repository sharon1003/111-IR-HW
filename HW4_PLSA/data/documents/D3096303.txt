showhydroxybupropion code name bw 306u  or 6hydroxybupropion is the major active metabolite of the antidepressant and smoking cessation drug bupropion 1 it is formed from bupropion by the liver enzyme cyp2b6 during firstpass metabolism 1 with oral bupropion treatment hydroxybupropion is present in plasma at area under the curve concentrations that are as many as 16–20 times greater than those of bupropion itself 1 2 demonstrating extensive conversion of bupropion into hydroxybupropion in humans 1 as such hydroxybupropion is likely to play a very important role in the effects of oral bupropion which could accurately be thought of as functioning largely as a prodrug to hydroxybupropion 1compared to bupropion hydroxybupropion is similar in its potency as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor  ic 50  17 µm and likely also acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent similarly to bupropion but is substantially weaker as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor ic 50  10 µm 3 like bupropion hydroxybupropion is also a noncompetitive antagonist of n ach receptors such as α 4β 2 and α 3β 4 but is even more potent in comparison 1 3 4 5 6contents  hide 1 pharmacokinetics2 research3 see also4 references pharmacokinetics  editbupropion is extensively and rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract but experiences extensive first pass metabolism rendering its systemic bioavailability limited exact bioavailability has yet to be determined given an intravenous form does not exist absorption is suggested to be between 8090 7 8 its distribution halflife is between 3–4 hours and exhibits moderate human plasma protein binding between 8288 with the parent compound and hydroxybupropion displaying the highest affinity 9 10 bupropion is a racemic mixture and is metabolized hepatically primarily via oxidative cleavage of its side chains by cyp2b6 hydroxybupropion is the most potent of the metabolites it is formed via the “ hydroxylation of the tertbutyl group ” by cyp2b6 and is excreted renally 9 cmax vales of hydroxybupropion are 47 times that of bupropion while the exposure to hydroxybupropion is 10 fold that of bupropion hydroxybupropions elimination halflife is roughly 20 hours give or take 5 hours and will reach steady state concentrations within 8 days 9 10research  editalthough there are patents proposing uses and formulations of this compound hydroxybuproprion is not currently marketed as a drug in and of itself and is only available for use in nonclinical research hydroxybupropion is not a scheduled drug or a controlled substance 11 one can access glp good lab practice documents detailing assaystechniques to further research and isolate this drug 12 13 otherwise there is little regulatory data available for hydroxybupropion at this time moreover there is little information to suggest hydroxybupropion has an abuse potential however it has been studied as a possible therapeutic for alcohol and nicotine abuse as a codrug 14there are few clinical trials or toxicology studies assessing hydroxybupropion alone at this time there are clinical studies which assess hydroxybupropion in conjunction with bupropion suggesting hydroxybupropion to be the primary form of the compound responsible for its clinical efficacy 15 16 also transdermal delivery of bupropion and hydroxybupropion has been assessed finding bupropion to be the superior candidate given its elevated diffusion rate through skin samples 17 there are few toxicology studies assessing hydroxybupropion alone at this time however there are some studies which assess this compound in conjunction with others or its parent compound see also  editradafaxine – the 2s3s isomer of hydroxybupropion manifaxine – an analogue of radafaxine and hydroxybupropion references  edit a b c d e f linda p
