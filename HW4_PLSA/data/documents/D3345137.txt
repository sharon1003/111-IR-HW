was cast for the role of tony di nozzo in 2003 series creator don bellisario related the events that led to weatherly being selected i liked him from the first moment i met him i first met him in australia where he was doing the natalie wood story and he was playing rj and the agents called me or the casting director called me and said i would like you to meet michael weatherly and i was on my last day down there and i said yeah im going home tomorrow you know ill meet him when he comes back to the states im going out to dinner with my family tonight i just dont have the time i received a phone call from michael and michael knows how to flatter you he started off by saying oh i love magnum p i  and then he started telling me all the things he knew about magnum p i and i said look if you want to go to dinner with me and my wife and two of my boys youre welcome well that ended up to be a three hour dinner it might have gone longer i liked him so much that i cast him in the show after that meeting 11on another occasion bellisario stated i cant say enough about michael weatherly he started out on ncis playing a character who was just very unlikable to some women because he was just such a chauvinist and he has gradually over the seasons changed taken his character and softened it 6weatherly said that he had initially been reluctant to join a jag spinoff and explained but i went and had this dinner with don bellisario in australia and his personality his storytelling and his presence and everything kind of won me over 12 he later commented i got very lucky with don bellisario he directed two of the first three episodes and he really pushed me to try things and experiment and some of the wacky comedy came out of that and it was kind of unexpected and i didnt really know what i was going to find 13at another point weatherly said its kind of fun to play a total dinosaur in terms of sexual politics the shallow end of the philosophical pool is obviously where tony paddles around in the same interview actress cote de pablo who portrays character ziva david added theres something deeper about that character we always talk about the superficial element and the things that make us laugh but he wouldnt be doing what he does if he wasnt really good at it its a complex character and thats why people love it 14weatherly has since directed the 2011 episode

annoying but whose absence is nevertheless keenly felt the targets of this behavior are either victims of tonys quests for new sources of amusement 43 or those for whom he believes he has reason to be

father that tony is the best young agent with whom he has ever worked di nozzo sr tells gibbs off believing him to have crossed a line but adds that tony thinks the world of gibbs 78 although he thinks very little of di nozzo senior gibbs does encourage di nozzo and senior to repair their relationship as of season 10 gibbs and senior appear to be on friendly terms 27through flashbacks in the episode  baltimore  it is shown that tony first met gibbs sometime in 2001 when he accidentally arrested the latter who was working undercover and investigating the same suspect in a separate case as a homicide detective with baltimore pd tony became disillusioned when he realized that his partner was dirty but could not bring himself to expose him gibbs took the opportunity to recruit him to ncis and has been a mentor to him since throughout the first several seasons tonys coworkers have all remarked that he is becoming more and more like gibbs especially when the latter is not around much to tonys annoyance 48 79 they also know each other well enough to predict the others next move and read each others behavioral cues with a single look 50 80 81 emotionally scarred when his doomed relationship with jeanne benoit ended he begins confiding in gibbs on personal issues especially after di nozzo senior is introduced in season 7 and the frosty lovehate relationship between father and son is revealed 82 83special agent timothy mc gee  edittonys relationship with timothy mc gee was initially problematic initially before mc gee officially joined the team mc gee was extremely respectful and looked up to tony often calling him sir and asking his permission to do things while tony largely ignored or degraded his work after joining the team tony began actively hazing mc gee as mc gee is the least experienced member of the ncis team and ranks only as a junior field agent having only worked at ncis for five or six years for example when mc gee joined the team as a probationary special agent tony began calling him probie including variations such as probiewan kenobi 28 he largely takes advantage of mc gees naiveté and unfamiliarity with the teams customs such as tricking him into drinking gibbs coffee as shown in the season 2 episode  forced entry  and assigning him unwanted and dirty tasks such as tracking down a gun in a mud pool 55 and digging for evidence like mike franks did with gibbs when gibbs was a probie tony also frequently made mc gee carry all the gear and equipment to the crime scene 52 84 in  red cell  he and kate pick the lock to mc gees apartment early in the morning several hours before they were due to report for work to observe you in your natural environment having bet on whether mc gee wore boxers or  tighty whities  some of tonys other nicknames for mc gee are plays on his name ranging from mc geek to mc google to mc probie 85 he also refers to mc gees onlinegaming persona elflord in some cases the names refer to aspects of mc gees character such as mc tardy a reference to mc gee being late mc sneaky as a reference to his ability to get almost any computerrelated document and mc cheat a reference to mc gee supposedly cheating at scrabble di nozzo at least once has also asked mc gee what are you mcdoing mc gee often he di nozzo and caitlin todd and later ziva david are shown teaming up to tease mc gee although it remains friendly contrary to appearances tony values his relationship with mc gee 28 as seen in the episode probie tony goes out of his way to support mc gee and makes an effort to cheer him up particularly shown when mc gee accidentally shoots an undercover police officer tony is the first one to try to allay mc gees feelings of guilt at one point after mc gee has expressed his chagrin at being called probie gibbs tells him that mike franks still calls him probie and suggests that it is not a sign of distaste or disrespect during gibbs absence however mc gee becomes the senior field agent as tony is now team leader at this time tony shows much more respect for mc gee and confidence in his abilities he also covers for mc gee several times when the entire team was late to a crime scene – thus incurring gibbs wrath – because of him 85in the beginning of the seventh season tony has more frequently called mc gee by his first name tim instead of these nicknames 47 an example of this is when mc gee is explaining something to gibbs and tony says its a burn phone tim just say burn phone it has been shown a few other times as well the relationship between the two agents is on a much more equal footing as the show moves into the seventh season mc gee is very rarely if at all referred to as probie any more by tony especially since ziva has become a probationary field agent 47after zivas departure from the team in the eleventh season tony has become a lot closer to mc gee and they have started to confide in one another much more than they used to for instance mc gee is the one tony tells that he has been attending a support group to get over the events of zivas departure mc gee also goes to tony for advice when he is considering asking his girlfriend move in with him in the same case when delilah confides in tony that she has been offered a job in dubai he goes to tell mc gee about her plans reception  editdi nozzo was included in tv guide  s list of tvs
