and then into nebraskas metropolitan city with a population of nearly 333000 the word omaha according to indian legend means above all others upon a stream indeed its location on the missouri played a key role in its development the river attracted both spanish and french explorers and fur traders as early as the 1700s americans made their first recorded visit in 1804 in the form of the lewis  clark expedition clark noted in his journal  this area would make a good location for a trading and military post manual lisa operated a trading post on the west bank of the river from 181223 followed by jean pierre cabanne 182333 a decree in 1834 which made the lands west of the missouri indian territory prevented settlement by whites for another 20 years however a ferry was established at traders point to accommodate emigrants who were just passing through heading west to oregon or california changes in the late 1840s when a multitude of mormons arrived was amazing and irreversible after their flight from illinois the mormons paused at millers hollow in iowa then in 1846 with permission from big elk chief of the omahas brigham young led them across the missouri to cold spring probably on the little papio near 61st street after a few months they moved to cutlers park in northern omaha in september they moved again to winter quarters the florence area where they constructed a city for 4000 people the quality of construction varied greatly from twostory houses with wood floors to dugouts with sod fronts before the year was over more than 700 had perished from exposure malnutrition and sickness the area was abandoned in 1848 when many headed west to the promised land in the valley of the great salt lake and others returned to iowa to await their turn today all that remains is a mill and the cemetery the gold rush of 1849 popularized the mormon trail and westbound travelers helped to dispel the myth that nebraska was the great american desert soon great public pressure was placed on officials to open the area to settlement this was accomplished in 1854 when a delegation of omaha indians headed by logan fontenelle signed the papers in washington d c ceding much of their lands to the government for a payment of nearly 850000 with this treaty and the passage of the kansasnebraska act the territory was ready for settlement omaha city was actually organized by the owners of the council bluffs  nebraska ferry company which ran between iowa and the nebraska territory they had prospered from the gold rush trade during which council bluffs had become an outfitting center and jumpingoff point for the overland route now its business leaders hoped to entice the proposed transcontinental railroad to their city and felt their chances would be improved if there was a city on the west bank of the river opposite council bluffs alfred jones omaha citys first postmaster platted the town site early in 1854 laying out 320 blocks all the towns along the river immediately became embroiled in the fight for the territorial capital not only would that designation ensure their dominance in the new territory but it would also give them an advantage in attracting the railroad at the first meeting of the territorial legislature held in omaha city on january 16 1855 florence bellevue and a number of other towns pleaded their virtues but the host town immerged as the winner omaha city was named county seat for douglas county the following year and incorporation procedures completed on february 2 1857 frank leslies illustrated newspaper november 6 1858 reported omaha city capital of nebraska territoryhas a population of about 4000 it has a pleasant and commanding site and is built close upon the margin of the river and contains some magnificent buildings omaha has through great opposition held the capital since the organization of the territory and is the most populous city with a commanding commercial position the only drawback being want of a good landing which a little expense might remedy the sitewas first known as the lone tree ferry where for several years w d brown ran a flatboat across the river with california emigrants and the place was an old campingground where the indian wardance and other wild extravaganzas were practiced without restraint omaha being one of the places earliest settled has been the theater of many scenes of interest excitement and border collision the pique and jealousy of other rival towns being brought constantly to bear against the capital the decision in 1863 to route the railroad through council bluffs guaranteed the growth of its city across the river throughout the remainder of the century by the time the first tracks were laid in july 1865 omaha whose post office had dropped the city portion of its name was already a major freight and outfitting center its wharves were jammed with steamboats and the business district was well established as territorial days ebbed and statehood was being pushed the battle for the location of the state capital escalated while it was almost unthinkable to place the states capital out on the prairies miles from civilization it happened after several days of bitter and sometimes violent retaliation against the the representatives who voted for a nonexistent town to be called lincoln in lancaster county local businessmen were persuaded that it was a prize that omaha could afford to let go while most other towns were in their infancy the people of omaha were transforming their town into patterns reminiscent of the homes left behind resonant with the sounds of men and women working to make a living build homes schools and churches this progressive young city was on its way omahas role in military history dates from 1868 when omaha barracks was established to protect railroad workers and settlers when the headquarters of the department of the platte was moved to this location in 1878 it was designated fort omaha for nearly 30 years it was the gathering and dispersal center for troops guarding the people in omaha and smaller settlements outstate in 1888 fort crook was organized to provide additional training grounds fort omaha which had become surrounded by the city suspended operations in 1896 but reopened between 190513 as a school for the signal corp with some classes in ballooning in 1916 with gathering warclouds in europe the fort was again activated this time under the name fort omaha balloon school the first such military school in america after the united states entered the war on april 6 1917 operations increased to the extent that a subpost was needed to accommodate men and the maneuvering balloons florence field about a mile north of the fort consisting of 119 acres was acquired for this purpose in the years following the war fort omaha remained under the command of the army during world war ii it served as a support installation for the 7th service command an induction center and a workcamp for italian war prisoners following that war command of the post was handed over to the navy the last units of the navy reserve command transferred out in 1974 and the grounds were deeded to metropolitan community college which opened at this site in 1975 now on the national register of historic places the historical society of douglas county operates the commanders residence as a restored house museum omaha faced a period of hardtimes back in the 1870s along with the rest of the nation but grew despite economic problems elsewhere because of the traffic being funneled through the city it achieved phenomenal progress in the great expansionary period of the 1880s augmented by the continued rapid settlement of the state the union pacific and other emerging railroads actively recruited settlers from the east and abroad selling them railroad land in nebraska the claims that the amount of rain increased with the amount of sod broken was believed and nebraskas population more than doubled during that decade from just over 450000 to well over 1000000 suddenly omaha had an agricultural hinterland spurred by edward rosewaters criticism in the omaha bee newspaper whose editorials attacked omahas donothing attitude of the 1870s businessmen responded by building the industries needed to process and market nebraskas agricultural and mineral wealth during the 1880s many of omahas flour mills breweries and meat and food processing plants were built omaha businessmen also developed a wholesale and jobbers industry which extended west along the railroads across nebraska and to the pacific coast traveling salesmen sold goods to smalltown shopkeepers for agents back in omaha the goods were then shipped out of omaha by rail for firms such as m e smith  co a drygoods wholesaler and omahabaum iron store a wholesaler of hardware in addition to bringing in millions of dollars in trade these salesmen played an important role in promoting omahas future businessman and promoter william paxton was a prime mover in the development of omaha as a livestock center he helped organize the union stock yards which ultimately became the largest industry dependent upon the midwests agricultural bounty the town of south omaha evolved out of the livestock trade and was laid out around the stockyards both entities grew rapidly and by 1890 the population numbered over 10000 people and claimed four major meat packing plants at the turn of the century south omaha known as the magic city had over 26000 inhabitants and was considered the backbone of omahas economy omaha saw a dramatic boom in the 1880s exclusive neighborhoods were established such as kountze place park wild and bemis park as the city grew the gold coast was developed along the high wooded area to the west of 38th street and west farnam became the place to live this set the pattern for expansion to the west successful business and professional people built fashionable homes and mansions in the blackstone area the cathedralduchesne area and even as far west as happy hollow and fairacres omahas expansion gave rise to the development of a number of small towns at the edge of the city dundee and benson were founded during this period they became complete communities with post offices village offices business districts schools and churches not at all interested in annexation immigrants from many european countries found omaha in need of their talents and skills readymade for the establishment of whole colonies in the new world german italian scandinavian austrian irish swiss and czech communities complete with a recreation and music hall in which traditional festivals and events abounded their contributions to the growth of omaha was significant to their credit many still support the rich ethnic heritage that enrich omahas cultural diversity the streetcar played an important role in facilitating the development of these communities along with railroad motorcars linking outlying towns separated by miles of farm land from the city seymour park ralston millard irvington and bennington also developed on the fringes of omahas prosperity in 1893 the bubble burst when overexpansion coupled with a drought resulted in a money panic with the economy nearly paralyzed omahas new subdivisions and these newlyplatted towns stood still stores manufacturing and processing plants closed thousands lost their jobs and eventually left the area all new construction ceased and many homes stood empty fortunately when the economy began to recover in the last part of the decade a leader emerged for omaha gurdon wattles orchestrated the transmississippi and international exposition of 1898 it stretched over an 180acre tract in north omaha and featured a 2000 feetlong lagoon which was encircled by 21 classical buildings exhibiting the worlds finest and most modern products tourism had arrived the knights of aksarben organized in 1895 provided a new dimension to the community by 1901 wattles had consolidated all the independent streetcar lines into one company and in 1903 he helped organize the omaha grain exchange and the omaha business mens association a group vowing to keep labor unions out of omaha and maintain open shops downtown construction and housing developments platted in the 1880s boom resumed in the midst of the wave of prosperity following the turn of the century nature delivered a catastrophic blow eastern nebraska became tornado alley in 1913 the most devastating of which struck omaha on easter sunday the tornado demolished or damaged over 2800 homes and businesses took 140 lives and injured another 400 a similar storm in 1975 caused many thousands of dollars more in damages but because of an early warning system far fewer injuries in both instances the people rallied together to clean up the debris and help to rebuild omahas skyline shot upward as wattles completed the fontenelle hotel in 1913 adding to omahas growth were the annexations of south omaha and dundee in 1915 followed by florence and benson in 1917 fairacres resisted annexation until the early 1940s the political leader of this period was mayor cowboy jim dahlman who served from 190618 and 192130 dahlman was closely associated with city boss tom dennison who was alleged to have support from both parties at all levels of local government even with a changed to a commissionform of government in 1911 dahlman was again appointed mayor major accomplishments of these years included the citys purchase of the waterworks the gas company and formation of the metroutilities district in 1921 signs of hardtimes were being felt even before the stock market crash in 1929 to their credit not one of omahas banks failed as a result of that event when new leaders were elected in the 1930s omaha was faced with the depression coupled with the drought which destroyed the crops and economic base of the farmlands that supplied omahas industries it brought the city to a virtually standstill by 1932 relief funds were drained not even the alphabet soup relief created by president f d roosevelt did much for omaha what finally ignited the economy was the end of the drought in 1939 and increasing orders for war materials needed for the conflict in europe in 1939 omahans celebrated the world premiere of the paramount movie union pacific during the weeklong gold spike days world war ii that burst upon the nation on december 7 1941 brought great changes to omaha while no large warindustries were located within the city many people worked at nearby plants the martin bomber plant at fort crook and the ordnance plant at mead many were employed at food processing plants turning out tons of flour cereal butter meat and dehydrated foods still others worked at the omaha alcohol plant where corn was turned into fuel largest of its kind in the world it produced 50000 gallons of alcohol daily for the war effort omahas work force climbed from 80000 in 1940 to over 100000 by 1945 omaha was justly proud of its volunteer efforts it received recognition for having started the national scrap metal drive for support of war bonds and for the red cross center and canteen at the railroad depots which hosted thousands of soldiers and never closed by the end of the war omaha was already planning improvements in 1946 the omaha public power district oppd began operations completing the goal of public ownership of utilities in 1947 both the downtown aksarben bridge and the south omaha bridge were made tollfree the first federally financed housing was started in 1948 and the municipal baseball stadium was built in 1949 in omahas centennial year 1954 ground was broken for a civic auditorium at the charter convention held to review municipal government a v sorensen emerged as the man who could provide leadership keep the delegates on track and encourage them to make the necessary changes the convention decided on a strong mayoral system in which voters elect seven council members responsible for executive matters and a mayor who appoints department heads to serve at his behest sorensen also was a good salesman getting the voter to approve the new charter that november he continued to serve the city first as councilman through the transition and later as mayor in 1956 omaha had at long last surpassed chicago as the worlds largest livestock market that same year western electric built a plant on a 390acre site near millard that would employ thousands in 1957 omaha was chosen the allamerican city by the national municipal league and by look magazine at the award dinner held in the new auditorium omahans reflected proudly on their thriving businesses good schools and colleges hospitals churches public parks and other recreational and cultural attractions which ranged from art museums and the symphony to horse racing indeed life during the 1950s seemed solid within the next decade however omaha began to experience the disquieting changes that typified urban life in america during the last half of the 20th century sorensen emerged from retirement in 1965 replacing mayor dworaks controversial administration armed with his takecharge attitude of facing problems headon sorensen dealt with the problems of busing and the desegregation of schools urban sprawl and the decay of the downtown business core open housing and integration in the work place as well as increasing crime and violence sorensen felt by many to be omahas best mayor brought the city through some very trying times and helped to create a new omaha diversification was the key to omahas new economy which includes a broad class of manufacturing and processing plants and many service industries the worlds largest health and accident company mutual of omaha as well as united of omaha guarantee mutual woodman of the world and physicians mutual are among the more than 40 insurance companies with home offices in the city transportation so important in omahas early growth currently provides an even greater role in delivering products goods and people around the country and the world the omaha airport authority created in 1959 recently oversaw a 60 million expansion project eppley airfield provides facilities to commercial and general aviation serving 12 major and several commuter airlines omaha corporate headquarters for the union pacific railroad remains a major employer in the city having installed a computerized system train dispatching center in the newlyrestored up freight station on the south edge of the con agra campus likewise communications remains important to omahas economic development beginning back in 1861 under the guidance of edward creighton for whom creighton university was named the western union telegraph company strung the first telegraph wires west of omaha eventually linking the atlantic and pacific coasts in 1941 american telephone  telegraph began installing underground cable west from omaha linking the city with long distance phone service to the west coast today in 1990 u s west communications has its 13state corporate headquarters in omaha quality phone service equipment and omahas central location has spurred the growth of the telecommunications and telemarketing industry over 20 reservation centers employ more than 10000 omahans making this the 800capital of the world agrelated industries continue to be an integral part of omahas heritage and have grown to dominate the food processing industry in addition to meat packers major employers include the kellogg company which daily turns the yield of thousands of acres of corn into corn flakes and the campbell soup company which produces frozen swanson and le menu products most recently
