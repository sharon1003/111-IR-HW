barclays cycle hire is a public bicycle hire scheme in london united kingdom the schemes bicycles are popularly known as boris bikes after boris johnson who was the mayor of london when the scheme was launched the operation of the scheme is contracted by transport for london to serco 2 bikes and docking stations are provided by pbsc urban solutions 3 the scheme is sponsored with santander uk being the main sponsor from april 2015 4barclays bank was the first sponsor from 2010 to march 2015 5 6 7credit for developing and enacting the scheme has been a source of debate johnson has taken credit for the plan 8 although the initial concept was announced by his predecessor ken livingstone during the latters term in office 9 livingstone said that the programme would herald a cycling and walking transformation in london 10 and johnson said that he hoped the bikes would become as common as black cabs and red buses in the capital 11a study showed cyclists using the scheme are three times less likely to be injured per trip than cyclists in london as a whole possibly due to motorists giving cycle hire users more road space than they do other cyclists 12 moreover recent customer research showed that 49 per cent of cycle hire members say that the scheme has prompted them to start cycling in london 13the record for cycle hires in a single day is 73000 14contents  hide 1 history2

he was planning to implement a cycle hire scheme modelled on the successful vélib network in paris following discussions with the mayor of paris livingstone instructed transport officials to study the paris and similar schemes and draw up proposals for london 15 discussions were conducted between transport for london tf l the london boroughs and transport commissioners from lyon brussels vienna berlin munich oslo and copenhagen 16in february 2008 plans for the london cycle hire scheme were officially unveiled by livingstone 17 the ctc and green party hailed the proposals as revolutionary 10bch commenced operations in july 2010 with 5000 bicycles and 315 docking stations distributed across the city of london area and parts of eight london boroughs 18 the scheme was at first located mainly within the central zone roughly bounded by the zone 1 area of the transport for london zoning system and the initial target was for it to comprise 400 docking stations when complete at roughly 300metre intervals the initial planning and implementation costs were expected to total more than £140 million over the first six years of the project exclusive of operating costs the program commenced operations on 30 june 2010 santander cycles has received some criticism for its use of commercial advertising and use of communal docking stations as well as erroneous charges bicycle and docking station issues and lack of coverage for the suburbs some users have also found the bikes too heavy and unwieldy at 23 kilograms 51 lb the success of the scheme has led to its expansion into other areas of london the coverage zone spans approximately 17 square miles 44 km 2  as of march 2012 there were some 8000 cycles and 570 docking stations in the scheme which had been used for over 19 million journeys 19initially bch required initial payment of registration and membership fees to be paid in exchange for an electronic access key but on 3 december 2010 this was changed to allow casual cycle hires by nonmembers who have a valid credit or debit card 20the project was expected to cost £140 million for planning and implementation over six years potentially the only tf l system to fully fund its annual cost of operation a goal originally estimated to take two to three years 21 the on the road cost of each bike is £28000 per bicycle 22between december 2010 and the end of may 2013 the scheme had registered 22 million rides without a death 23the first fatality of a user of the scheme occurred in july 2013 a 20yearold woman philippine de gerinricard was killed outside aldgate east underground station after being struck by a lorry 24 prompting a protest ride calling for improved separation between cycle routes and other traffic 25in march 2014 101 of the 10000 bikes in the scheme were coloured yellow to mark 100 days until the arrival of the 101st tour de france in london on monday 7 july 2014 26 27operation  editregular users of the scheme can register on the tf l website and buy access for 24 hours 7 days or one year users are then posted a key to operate the docking stations keys cost £3 and up to four can be registered under a single account the key allows a cycle to be released from the docking station 28on 3 december 2010 the scheme was extended to casual users who are not members of the scheme but hold major payment cards 29 the cost is the same to members and casual users except that casual use for one year is not available a credit or debit card can be used in a docking station to release a bicycle access for 24 hours or 7 days can be purchased cycles may be rented at any time during the access period use for no more than 30 minutes at a time is free of charge 30 usage charges additional to the access charge are weighted to favour

the luggage rack and twin led rear lights are integrated into the robust frame which weighs approximately 23 kg 51 lb 33 35the bikes were designed by industrial designer michel dallaire and built in the saguenay quebec region by cycles devinci with aluminium provided by rio tinto alcan 36 a canadian company based in montreal and part of an international mining group headquartered in the uk the cycles are lowgeared to compensate for their weight and to provide a way of limiting their top speed using a shimano nexus threehub gear with a 38 tooth chainring in front and a larger than standard 23 tooth rear sprocket the setting is 32 gear inches in first gear 44 gear inches in second gear and 60 gear inches in third gear 37 this gearing is about 22 lower than would be usual on a threespeed cycle of this sort the cycles and the docking stations are built in canada by pbsc urban solutions and are based on the bixi bike taxi cycle rental system that operates in many cities including montreal 38 melbourne 39 and toluca 40in december 2015 it was decided to fit all the cycles with front lasers the laser projects a green cycle symbol approximately 15 feet in front of the bike to warn

the cycle hire scheme was extended significantly in east london and there was a minor western expansion around shepherds bush 2300 additional bikes and 4800 more docking points were added 44in december 2013 the scheme received a further significant expansion phase 3 in west and south west london this expansion added approximately 2000 more bikes and 150 new docking points with new stations in the boroughs of wandsworth hammersmith  fulham lambeth and kensington  chelsea 45however despite calls from other londoners the scheme has yet to expand into many areas close to central london including central and north islington 46 47 coverage 48 is noticeably poor in southeast london an area that has a limited overall tube network 49 coverage is exceptionally poor in outer london where the scheme is almost nonexistent even in areas adjacent to inner london districts and despite the majority of londoners living here in some cases planned expansion has been delayed by londoners who support the london cycle hire scheme in principle but dislike the idea of having a docking station on their street or losing car parking spaces to make room for docking stations 50by december 2013 the cycle hire scheme had 11500 bikes for hire 51in march 2016 santander cycles expanded to cover the queen elizabeth olympic park 52there are calls to expand the scheme further east into the london borough of southwark where some areas are poorly served by public transport the bakerloo line is not expected to be extended until 2030 many greenwich residents are also keen to see an expansion there perhaps via the greenwich foot tunnel a petition has been raised 53 with 15000 new homes being built on the greenwich peninsula there will be significant demands on public transport a network of santander cycles stations around greenwichdeptfordnew cross would significantly enhance the connectivity between dlr trains and overground there however funding for expansion into greenwich remains a challenge 54the cycle scheme is not to be confused with santander cycles mk which is run by nextbike and only caters to the milton keynes area docking stations  editdocking station in southwark

during high load hours the bikes are moved from the busiest stations to the emptiest using trailers pulled by alkè atx280e electric vehicles with zero co 2 emissions 56 and ford transit vans with

months of the scheme 95 percent of journeys did not exceed half an hour earning tf l access fees but no usage fees 58 the scheme generated £323545 in revenue for usage in the first 96 days 58 only 72700 of the first 14 million journeys earned any revenue with 44 percent of income coming from users charged the £150 us 252 late return fees 58 with an average £3370 income per day from journeys the scheme needed to grow substantially over the following five years to meet its cost 58 in this early period there was a steady growth in the number of bike journeys it was expected that when casual use was introduced it would become the bigger revenue generator 58 access fees were doubled in january 2013 59 which was expected to bring in an extra £46m annually 60 user satisfaction level dropped after the increase 61in may 2012 before access charges doubled in 2013 tf l estimated that the scheme would cost taxpayers £225m by 201516 almost 5 times the maximum due from barclays 62 63tf l funded a net £36 million to the scheme in the 201617 period during which 10 million bikes were hired this equates to 169 of the schemes operating costs being funded by subsidy 64 this is on par with tf ls operating costs as a whole which are 161 funded by subsidy including the congestion charge as subsidy 65 reception and criticism  editbch debuted with great fanfare with over 90000 users registering one million cycle rides being taken in the first ten weeks of operation 66 the millionth journey rider was awarded free annual membership to the scheme for five years for him and three friends 67in particular the bch scheme was criticised for allowing riders to have unlimited use by docking the bike every thirty minutes at a station the first 30 minutes use are free resulting in a dependence upon late fees and penalties to make up revenues 58 68 other users complained of computer issues erroneous charges and problems with docking stations 69 70 71 72 the system requires the cyclist to find docking stations close to the points of departure and destination lacking one of the key advantages of the bicycle in an urban setting 73 the system also does not enable transport to the suburbs as tf l says it is best for short journeys 74 some users also found the bikes too heavy and unwieldy at 23 kilograms 51 lb 33 35in june 2011 tf l issued a critical improvement plan to the bch contractor serco demanding immediate improvements in service and in a comment to the press a tf l spokesman stated that the service it serco has provided for our barclays cycle hire users has not reached the consistently high standards we expect adding we expect to see immediate improvements serco has in turn admitted that some aspects of the service still need to be improved 75redistribution of bikes has also been hindered by the refusal by the councils of westminster and of kensington  chelsea to allow serco to move bikes around their boroughs at night between the hours of 22000800 creating significant challenges in meeting morning peak demand 76at the time of launch antiarmstrade campaigners protested against barclays involvement in the scheme and attached stickers to the bikes highlighting the banks investment in the arms trade 77 78the cycle hire scheme and those who delivered it achieved recognition from a wide crosssection of industries impacted by the project a total of 15 awards were received within a year of launch  citation needed recognising not just the impact on transport in london but also the innovative design the public relations exercise and the challenging delivery timescales those awards included best facility from the london cycling campaign 79 and an infrastructure award from the institution of civil engineers 80repair and replacement  editan alkè

used any number of times within the access period each use charged according to its duration access fees doubled in january 2013 59 and the weekly access period was withdrawn in january 2015 as of january 2015 the two access fee options were 24hour access for £2 or annual access for members only for £90 extra ride charges are weighted to promote the constant circulation of bicycles the first 30 minutes of each journey are free for longer hire durations the price increases by £2 every extra 30 minutes this means a user can have as many journeys as they like and only pay £2 so long as each journey is under 30 minutes bicycles must be returned within 24 hours failure to return a bicycle or damaging one could incur a charge of up to £300  citation neededsee also  edito bike mobike notes
