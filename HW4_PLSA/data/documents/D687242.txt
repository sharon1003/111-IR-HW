retailers and customers to schedule the distribution of electricity securitization a proposal for issuing bonds that would be used to buy down existing power contracts or other obligations the bonds would be repaid by designating a portion of future customer bill payments customer bills would be lowered since the cost of bond payments would be less than the power contract costs that would be avoided securitize to aggregate contracts into one pool which then offers shares for sale in the investment market this strategy diversifies project risks from what they would be if each project were financed individually thereby reducing the cost of financing small power producer spp under the public utility regulatory policies act purpa a small power production facility or small power producer generates electricity using waste renewable biomass conventional hydroelectric wind and solar and geothermal energy as a primary energy source fossil fuels can be used but renewable resource must provide at least 75 percent of the total energy input see code of federal regulations title 18 part 292 spark spread a measurement of the difference between the price that a generator can obtain from selling one megawatt hour mwh of electricity and the cost of the natural gas needed to generate the mwh of electricity spark spread is a measure of potential profit for generating electricity on a particular day a key component in the spark spread equation is the heat rate measure of efficiency of the generating unit a common measure for heat rate used in the trade press is 7000 btuk wh this heat rate is broadly representative of the efficiency of newer natural gas combinedcycle power plants by way of comparison a plant that has a 50 efficiency rate has a heat rate of 6824 btuk wh the most efficient natural gas combinedcycle power plants have heat rates somewhat below the 7000 btuk wh threshold they can make money even when the implied breakeven heat rate is a little below 7000 btuk wh conversely as the level of plant efficiency decreases the spark spread diminishes—thus older less efficient plants have lower spark spreads than those with a heat rate of 7000 btuk wh spinning
