gastroenteritis when you eat or drink contaminated food or water or if you share utensils towels or food with someone whos infected a number of viruses can cause gastroenteritis including noroviruses both children and adults are affected by noroviruses the most common cause of foodborne illness worldwide norovirus infection can sweep through families and communities its especially likely to spread among people in confined spaces in most cases you pick up the virus from contaminated food or water although persontoperson transmission also is possible rotavirus worldwide this is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children who are usually infected when they put their fingers or other objects contaminated with the virus into their mouths the infection is most severe in infants and young children adults infected with rotavirus may not have symptoms but can still spread the illness — of particular concern in institutional settings because infected adults unknowingly can pass the virus to others a vaccine against viral gastroenteritis is available in some countries including the united states and appears to be effective in preventing the infection some shellfish especially raw or undercooked oysters also can make you sick although contaminated drinking water is a cause of viral diarrhea in many cases the virus is passed through the fecaloral route — that is someone with a virus handles food you eat without washing his or her hands after using the toilet risk factors gastroenteritis occurs all over the world affecting people of every age race and background people who may be more susceptible to gastroenteritis include young children children in child care centers or elementary schools may be especially vulnerable because it takes time for a childs immune system to mature older adults adult immune systems tend to become less efficient later in life older adults in nursing homes in particular are vulnerable because their immune systems weaken and they live in close contact with others who may pass along germs schoolchildren churchgoers or dormitory residents anywhere that groups of people come together in close quarters can be an environment for an intestinal infection to get passed anyone with a weakened immune system if your resistance to infection is low — for instance if your immune system is compromised by hivaids chemotherapy or another medical condition — you may be especially at risk each gastrointestinal virus has a season when its most active if you live in the northern hemisphere for instance youre more likely to have rotavirus or norovirus infections between october and april complications the main complication of viral gastroenteritis is dehydration — a severe loss of water and essential salts and minerals if youre healthy and drink enough to replace fluids you lose from vomiting and diarrhea dehydration shouldnt be a problem infants older adults and people with suppressed immune systems may become severely dehydrated when they lose more fluids than they can replace hospitalization might be needed so that lost fluids can be replaced intravenously dehydration can be fatal but rarely prevention the best way to prevent the spread of intestinal infections is to follow these precautions get your child vaccinated a vaccine against gastroenteritis caused by the rotavirus is available in some countries including the united states given to children in the first year of life the vaccine appears to be effective in preventing severe symptoms of this illness wash your hands thoroughly and make sure your children
