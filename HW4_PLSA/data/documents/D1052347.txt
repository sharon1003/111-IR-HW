mortgage real cost calculator or should i pay off my mortgage thinking of paying off or prepaying your mortgage this tool will help you decide most people calculate the true cost of their mortgage as their interest rate less any tax savings from an interest deduction on their tax return they may think well my mortgage rate is 5 and im in the 25 tax bracket so my true rate is 375 the federal government lets them write off the interest with a 25 tax savings so their net cost is 75 of their rate essentially they think the federal government pays 25 of the mortgage well that thinking is not entirely accurate because the federal government gives every taxpayer the option of taking a standard deduction whether they are a renter or have a mortgage their actual tax savings may not be the 25 or whatever their marginal rate is even if they pay off their mortgage they still get the standard deduction furthermore taxpayers earning over 155650 may have their itemized deductions limited so their tax savings are also less than anticipated if your income reaches a certain level you may not get to write off your mortgage at all in fact the tax savings you receive from your mortgage interest are dependent on your income age filing status and a number of other variables including some not accounted for here this calculator attempts to account for some of these issues estimating your actual tax savings from mortgage interest there are several numbers from your tax return needed to make the calculations please refer to your last years 1040 tax return or estimate the values for the coming year leave the line blank if it does not apply note in order to receive an interest deduction you must itemize your deductions fill out schedule a and file form 1040 with the irs if you filed or plan to file form 1040a or 1040ez or you do not expect to itemized your deductions leave the fields that do not apply blank important  the calculations are not deemed reliable for informational purposes only not to be used for tax advice consult your tax adviser before making any decisions based on these figures these figures may not be accurate for your situation tax laws are complex and this calculator may not have accounted for every detail on your return or calculated the taxes correctly use at your own risk known exceptions this does not calculate the effect of the alternative minimum tax the amt calculation has become a rats nest of convoluted logic shame on our politicians for not fixing this  so we do not go through every possible calculation thus the amt alert may not be accurate check with your tax advisor if you have amounts on lines 18 or 19 on schedule d your tax amount may be incorrect if you get a foreign tax credit have tax from form 4972 file form 2555 or 2555ezz or use schedule j to calculate your taxes the amt alert below may not be accurate values not accurate for estates or trusts does not consider additional 38 net investment income tax aca or obamacare tax these are best estimates of tax year 2016 figures be sure to email this page to a friend or share on social media as this information is crucial and this calculator is available nowhere else
