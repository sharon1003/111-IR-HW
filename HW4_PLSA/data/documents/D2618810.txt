science weather  tides tides q what are the characteristics of all waves a quick answer characteristics that all waves have in common are wavelength amplitude and frequency apart from these properties different types of waves have a number of varying characteristics a wave is defined as a repetitive disturbance traveling through a medium going from one location to another continue reading keep learning how are sea waves formed what are the three aspects of sound waves how are wavelength and frequency related credit john white photos moment getty images full answer wavelength is the distance between one point on a wave to a point on the same part of the next wave wavelength is usually measured from crest to crest or trough to trough the crest is the highest point of the wave and the trough is the lowest point amplitude is the maximum displacement of the wave the higher the wave the larger the amplitude is frequency is the number of waves in a period of time the hertz is the unit used for measuring frequency with sound a higher frequency indicates a higher pitched sound with color different frequencies correlate with different colors for instance blue has a higher frequency than red several different types of waves exist among the types are light waves sound waves microwaves and xrays waves travel at different speeds speed is determined by calculating the distance the wave travels divided by the time it takes to travel that distance the medium affects the speed at which a wave travels some waves also carry more energy than others and some waves are longer than others learn more about tides sources cordedu physicsclassroomcom related questions q what are some of the properties common to all electromagnetic waves a some of the properties which are common to all electromagnetic waves are amplitude a characteristic frequency and wavelength and the ability to travel th full answer filed under optics  waves q how are tidal waves formed a tidal waves are caused by the gravitational fields of the sun the moon and the earth a tidal wave is a small regularly occurring wave caused by the shif full answer filed under tides q what causes tidal waves a tidal waves are caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon on the earth the moons gravitational pull has a greater influence on earth because i full answer filed under tides q what are some characteristics of werewolves a characteristics of werewolves include reddishbrown almondshaped fingernails that are particularly tough bristles beneath the tongue nervousness and pac full answer filed under folklore you may also like q what are some characteristics of diligent people q what are some characteristics of holden caulfield q what are the characteristics of a haiku q is there a red tide in siesta key fla q what are the physical characteristics of london england q what are your pin oak trees characteristics
