customer reviews sandy beach top contributor pets50 out of 5 stars liquid gold november 30 2016size 16ounce verified purchase my corgi nova has mega esophagus and has trouble gaining and keeping on weight due to this condition dyne has been a life saver literally a life saver this has helped her maintain a healthy weight when she is having a rough week and can not keep food down or doesnt want to eat dyne encourages her to eat something and get some nutrients into her we use to put it on her food every day when she was underweight now we only use it on bad weeks when she cant keep food down i love this stuff and would recommend it to anyone who needs help with getting their dog to eat it smells like cake batter and she just loves it i can feed it to her alone or on her food for those of you familiar with knox blocks i also mix dyne in with my knox blocks to give them a better taste and increase calories i let the knox cool down before i add the dyne so as to not kill any beneficial nutrients in the heat but it mixes well and gives the knox a better taste i also no longer have to make them with chicken broth which is high in sodium thank you dyne read more comment 32 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abusekathy l50 out of 5 stars i love this stuffmarch 19 2017size 1gallon verified purchase i love this stuff after my small husky had her babies she looked like one of those dogs you would see on the commercials for abused animals she looked horrible it is thick and gooey but she loved the vanilla flavored coating on her food i just added it to a high quality puppy food and some probiotics she looked so much better in just a couple of weeks just remember not to feed too much puppy food at a time with it the first time i gave her too much puppy food i just wanted her weight back on her she loved it so much she ate all of it and threw it up i just started using a smaller portion of food at a time read more comment 5 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse humanist amazon top contributor pets50 out of 5 stars this is a great product i recently got a german shepherd puppy  july 16 2017size 16ounce verified purchase this is a great product i recently got a german shepherd puppy who was a little on the skinny side and needed a little help putting on weight i was worried that this product might not be palatable to her as many supplemental products often have a smell or taste that dogs arent fond of it but she absolutely loved the taste i drizzled the appropriate amount over her food and she ate it all up it apparently has such an appealing smell that my other two dogs seemed disappointed that they didnt also get some on their food it did the trick in helping my sweet girl gain the weight she needed so i couldnt be happier its a great product if you have a dog that needs to put on a few pounds or if you need to add a little something to your dogs meal to entice them to eat but be sure to keep an eye on their weight and make sure theyre putting on too much weight as this is a high calorie supplement read more comment 2 people found this helpful was this review

of 5 stars bottle does not come sealed or protected october 7 2017size 32ounce verified purchase only 3 stars because i just recieved it today and the bottle was not sealed or protected so a lot had spilled out into the packaging  it smells good and i mixed a tablespoon with my yorkiepoms kibble and he ate it all  he is super picky and refuses to eat anything not human food hopefully this will help put a few pounds on him  ill update my review in a month update  i only used this product for a week before my pup became lethargic with black stool and non stop vomit the emergency vet i took him to could not be certain what caused him to get so sick but said it may be due this product i dumped the entire thing in the garbage i read other reviews of dogs getting sick off of this stuff and it could very well be the super long list of unpronounceable ingredientsbut like any product be careful when feeding your furry family anything and do so with discretion 1 star for landing at the er

verified purchase le roy seems to like it so far hes lost a lot of weight due to nerves and not eating the noises of the trucks and the inconsiderate neighbor that still has fireworks has taken its toll on my little fella hoping that this helps him to eat his kibble more readily now the dyne pros tastele roy seems to love it and takes it down easy smelli expected this to stink because of the fatty nature but the smell of vanilla is prevalent and not overpowering cons only 1its so thick as it should be that it is hard to pour for measuring and then get it in your dog i suppose letting him lick a spoon would be the best delivery because pouring it on the food you lose a bit of it all in all its a great product so far i will update to see if it has added some meat to my babys bones update the king has gained three pounds half of his original weight and he is eating his grainfree dry food now without needing dyne for every meal im so very happy and hes better read more comment
