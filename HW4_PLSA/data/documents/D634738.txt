9999 expand view full gallery pros  the dvd player comes with a 14inch screen which is among the largest available cons  the builtin speakers are quiet verdict  the pyle pdh14 is the best portable dvd player available with great features and a large screen when looking for a portable dvd player there are several factors to consider including the overall video quality the extra features and the design its unlikely that youll find a device with every feature and design element you want but with the pyle pdh14 we think you can get very close the pyle has the largest screen of all of the travel dvd players we reviewed at 14 inches in diameter it also has a complete range of additional features including antiskipping and parental controls it comes with both sd and usb ports but its battery does not perform as well as advertised running about 20 minutes shy of two hours also its builtin speakers are quieter than many other portable dvd players still if you need a dvd player for your road trip the pyle pdh14 is the best option available today and winner of our top ten reviews gold award pyle pdh14visit site screen size optimal viewing angle speaker volume headphone volume tested playback time diagonal measure of the display screen inches1 pyle 140 inches2 audiovox 101 inches3 ematic 116 inches category average 977 inches video  audio performance among the devices we reviewed the average screen size is nine inches at 14 inches the pyles screen should give everyone in the back seat of the car a clear view of the action the maximum viewing angle is 40 degrees which is fairly average two people will be able to comfortably watch a movie without screen distortion while the colors and brightness are great at default settings the picture was slightly blurry on our test dvd the speakers are a little quieter than many other travel dvd players so if you are using the builtin speakers while on the road you may have trouble hearing your movie the better way to listen to movies is through headphones which are actually louder than other players’ headphone ports both the speakers and the headphones are clear so you’ll get great quality either way portability features the device has all of the extra features we look for the most important of these is antiskipping the last thing you want to deal with is your movie skipping ahead because of a speed bump and with this car dvd player you won’t have to worry about that it also has playback memory which allows you to stop a movie turn off the player and pick up where you left off when you turn the player back on if you play a different dvd you’ll lose the playback memory on the first but that should not be a surprise the player comes with a remote control so you won’t have to worry about your kids getting out of their seats to control it unfortunately it does not come with headphones so you’ll have to provide your own for best listening if you have two people watching a movie you’ll need to also buy a headphone splitter since there is only one headphone jack if you’re concerned about how your kids use the dvd player you can set up parental controls that include content controls and time limits design the pyle pdh14 is among the largest portable dvd players we reviewed but that is due to its larger screen it’s also much heavier than most other players weighing just over 6 pounds it comes with an audiovideo port so you can plug the player into a television you can access media files with its usb and sd ports so you’re not limited to your dvd collection the player uses a foldup design and the screen can swivel left and right if you have the screen set on top of your car’s front middle console you can easily adjust the screen to make sure the viewing angle works for those in the back seat while it comes with a power adapter for your car it does not include a headrest mount pyle claims that the battery can last a maximum of two hours which is disappointing since some movies can be two to three hours long we charged the battery and played a dvd on full repeat to see how long it would actually last we were disappointed when it only lasted just over an hour and a half if you’re watching a longer movie make sure to have the charger handy help  support unfortunately few manufacturers offer great support options and pyle audio is no different than the rest this dvd player comes with a oneyear warranty but the only way to contact customer service is through email fortunately we were able to get quick responses to our emails we wish there were more ways to get in touch with support representatives but we are happy that we were able to establish contact so quickly summary the pyle pdh14 is the best portable dvd player available with its large 14inch screen it has the best display of all of the devices on our lineup the screen has a 40degree viewing angle and the picture is a little blurry its builtin speakers are quieter than other top portable dvd players but the sound quality is great in our tests the battery life did not live up to the advertised battery life unfortunately pyle audio doesn’t offer telephone support or online live chat but its email contact method is very responsive we like the extra features and the ability to play media from usb and sd ports but our favorite aspect of the player is its impressive screen pyle pdh14visit site
