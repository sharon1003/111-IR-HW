setting up a shooting range safety must be your main priority when setting up a shooting range whether it be in your garden a friendly farmers field or even in your attic space thought must be given to where the pellet is going to finish up and what might cause it to deviate from its intended path a modern air rifle is capable of shooting a pellet up to 250 yards and for most shooters unless you are shooting in a field this means the shot will travel off your property unless you have taken precautions to prevent it the following should give you some ideas and while not a complete list will get you thinking safety when setting up your range you must ensure that either a suitable backstop has been set up to prevent the pellet from travelling further than you intend do not assume that your garden fence will act as a backstop it wontyou can see clearly at least the maximum distance the pellet could travel with no footpaths or public rights of way in the direction you intend to shoot there is no possibility of a person or pet entering your range while you are shooting if shooting in your garden give consideration to your neighbours talk to them explain what you are doing show them you are acting in a safe and responsible manner ensure that the target you are shooting at will not cause a ricochet metal targets should be at 90Â° angle to you never shoot at golf balls or other rubber objects the shot will ricochet and possibly come straight back to you
