louisiana politics  government homestead exemptions no longer automatic in st tammany posted october 4 2010 at 510 pmcomment by christine harvey the timespicayune the st tammany parish assessors office will no longer grant automatic homestead exemptions to new homeowners after assessor patricia schwarz core received complaints about the practice core said she first learned about the practice  inherited from her predecessor  at the beginning of her tenure as assessor in the early 1990s she said she continued the practice so she can provide the parishs various taxing bodies with the most accurate revenue estimates possible she mentioned the change at a recent meeting of the northlakemandeville rotary club at beau chene country club core touched on several items concerning the work her office does though the homestead issue was the highlight of her discussion she said she only allowed the automatic exemptions for those who listed the same mailing and physical address on the deed meaning that the person planned to live in the house the house must be a persons primary residence to qualify for a homestead exemption which exempts people from paying taxes on the first 75000 of their homes value according to state law core said used to grant the automatic extension then notify the new homeowner that he or she needed to file for the exemption as soon as possible those who didnt file nonetheless continued to receive the exemption the practice ensured that the exemption did not lapse and provided the taxing bodies with a more accurate accounting of what to expect in property tax collections however core suspended the practice after people complained she was not following the law she said people will need to file for their exemptions on their own and those who fail to do so will be charged the full amount of property taxes anyone who qualifies for an exemption but simply forgot to file for one may request a refund for the amount owed core said but she first would have to complete a change order with the state tax commission for the amount and submit the paperwork to the sheriffs office which serves as the parishs tax collector a process that could take three to four months as a result the amount of money that the taxing bodies expected to collect will decrease with each change order she said core said she wasnt breaking the law by granting the automatic exemptions because nearly all of the houses qualified for them she said her office has found just five or so that slipped through the cracks  cases where people received an exemption but didnt actually live in the home in other matters core explained that she is required by state law to tax certain undeveloped land at a fraction of its potential value one man mentioned what he called valuable land along interstate 12 near u s 190 that he said qualified for a use value assessment but core said she cannot go against the law even though the property might one become valuable in the future she also noted that st tammany has the highest tax rate in the region  170 mills  topping orleans parish by 1 mill the st tammany parish school board received the most tax revenue  nearly 45 percent  with fire protection second at nearly 18 percent residential land and improvements are the largest generators of tax revenue with a combined percentage of almost 54 percent view comments
