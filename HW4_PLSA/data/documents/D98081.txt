sides of the château chart the evolution of castle architecture a fact which guides find unusually fascinating and certainly françois is seeandbeseen outside staircase  underlining power with display

joanofarc photo alamy chenonceau chenonceau reminds you why you admire france arching over the river cher it is so damnably and harmoniously perfect that it surely respects some aesthetic law of the universe but it was also seat to skullduggery debauchery and the revelation that when prominent in affairs women arent necessarily a whole lot sweeter than men henri ii bought chenonceau for dianedepoitiers once his governess now his mistress and though 20 years his senior still bewitching she bathed often in asses milk apparently diane created gardens and put the bridge across the river

france photo apon his death his widow catherinedemédicis stout not beautiful resolute evicted diane and took chenonceau for herself as a permanent theatre of her insatiable vengeance she added the gallery to the bridge so making for the most romantic photos in the loire she also threw worldclass gardenparties transvestites nymphs satyrs etc to showcase the monarchical power of her three sons the splendour remains the formal gardens are still deeply satisfying within furnishings are sumptuous the art startling rubens van dyck an arresting three graces by van loo and the flowers always

trees like dragons others with legs a labyrinth gnomes modelled on french politicians and hammocks the 14 rivau gardens pass any test horticulturewise 450 brands of rose that sort of thing but whats really grabbing is the way owner patricia laigneau has woven into them myths legends fantasy and fun enough for the attentiondeficient the château de rivau is small unsung and lovely photo alamy inside the château small unsung lovely there are hunting heads with teddy bears on a stags head hung with a queenly costume and enough other absurdity to hold the interest against cornices and similar im particularly keen on an installation work of a kneeling joanofarc muttering almost audibly in latin this year will see the work of 10 other artists dotted about the place meanwhile dont miss the stableblock it was essentially a stately home for horses joan called in here for replacement nags en route to orléans in 1429 some 585 years on she could have had a snack lunch  from local produce

incorporated the italian renaissance man it was in 1516 that leonardo da vinci crossed the alps on a donkey the mona lisa in his saddlebag françois installed him in this brick manor house 400 metres from amboise château paying him a pension for the last three years of his life in return leonardo provided conversation designs including conceivably the double helix staircase at chambord and inventions not least for royal parties a giant lion which when hit on the chest disgorged fleurdelys proved a particularly successful icebreaker these days clos lucé is an outstanding shrine to a

the most magnificent loire château  conceived by the 25yearold françois i not so much as an abode but to ram home the superbness of a french monarchy second in splendour only to god in a sense the building sums up french history the monumental scale and strength of the 156metre façade and towers the finery and elegance  and the unavoidable tendency to go bonkers with the forest of 282 chimneys bristling like the planets leading only collection of giant cruet sets and the place is like france itself riddled with backstairs and hidden passages ripe for skullduggery political theatricality was built into the château  notably in the central doublespiral staircase but monarchs werent always as absolute as they thought even françois adulterous philandering experienced setbacks he didnt take them well on his chamber window was scratched women are fickle very stupid is he who trusts them visitors complain that the châteaus 440 rooms have been emptied not really they were only rarely full the french court moved around all the time françois i spent only eight weeks in total at chambord décor and furnishings were sent on ahead and when the king moved taken out and sent on again the monarchs entourage might number 10000 with 20000 horses you really didnt want a surprise visit from these people once youve done the château dont ignore the park at 13000 acres its bigger than central

but villandry by the river cher is something else the gardens are vast terraced and laid out with geometric formality as if created with setsquares and compasses rather than spades the lines the swirls the colours the designs the precision leave almost all the senses exalted seen from the château above the gardens resemble a gigantic puzzlepage brilliantly filled in the french have always felt that left to god nature was a little wayward at villandry they impose order and nature responds in stimulating fashion the gardens at villandry are vast terraced and laid out with geometric formality photo apthis being a renaissance garden there are of course layers of symbolism  love sex corruption apparently a quality of cabbages which will surprise noone meanwhile the chateau itself
