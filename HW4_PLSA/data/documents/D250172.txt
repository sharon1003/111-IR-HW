how surveillance cameras can help prevent and solve crime the potential value of public surveillance technology took on new meaning last week when investigators identified the two suspects in the boston marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city’s cameras this has prompted public officials like chicago mayor rahm emanuel to speak of the “important function” such cameras play in offering safety on a daily basis and during events both big and small the successful use of this technology in such a highprofile investigation is likely to prompt other major cities to reaffirm – and even expand – their investment in and use of surveillance cameras civil liberties advocates fear this would create an undue invasion of privacy in the ensuing debates over privacy versus safety advocates on both sides would be wise to consider the following guidelines public surveillance cameras and civil liberties can coexist if cameras are implemented and employed responsibly our guidebook for using public surveillance systems advises law enforcement to consider privacy issues when creating surveillance policies for one cameras should avoid or mask inappropriate views of private areas such as yards and secondstory windows law enforcement agencies should also document and publicize policies governing how surveillance cameras can be used and what the disciplinary consequences are for misuse likewise officers should be thoroughly trained on these policies and held accountable for abiding by them public surveillance camera systems can be a costeffective way to deter document and reduce crime urban’s research has shown that in baltimore and chicago cameras were linked to reduced crime even beyond the areas with camera coverage the cost savings associated with crimes averted through camera systems in chicago saved the city over four dollars for every dollar spent on the technology while baltimore yielded a 50 cent return on the dollar the usefulness of surveillance technology in preventing and solving crimes depends on the resources put into it our evaluation of three cities found that the most effective systems are monitored by trained staff have enough cameras to detect crimes in progress and integrate the technology into all manner of law enforcement activities as with any technology the use of cameras is by no means a substitute for good oldfashioned police work the detectives we interviewed reported that camera footage provides additional leads in an investigation and aids in securing witness cooperation and prosecutors noted that video footage serves as a complement to—but not a replacement for—eyewitness evidence in the courtroom technological advances will continue to enhance our ability to monitor public spaces by extension technology will continue to aid efforts to prevent crime and apprehend criminals while the use of cameras to identify suspects involved in the boston marathon bombings may prompt cities to seize upon additional surveillance opportunities they should do so cautiously—and with the benefit of lessons learned from other citiesphoto via shutterstock share this pageshare related content a wrongfully

using cctv for security to protect life and liberty and the city using cctv as a revenue generator against its citizens these red light cameras are purely for generating revenue from boston from boston not verified said at 444 pm on april 30th 2013 the boston bombers were apprehended quickly due to surveillance cameras yes all agree no dispute over how well the public cameras were on that day who draws the line at what is public interest and just plain harassment when a camera is placed dozens of cases have found courts stand behind the cameras but what about the camera placed by a private citizen for property surveillance what about the private camera placed on property with malicious intent who regulates the camera on private property decides the camera on private property deliberately fixed and set to view 15 feet away into another home this camera is in plain sight of both parties the camera does not view public property it is not on a roadway it does not deter crime due to timing proximity history of adverse neighbor relations it was placed for the sole purpose of retaliation police citing public interest of all cameras could not assist the owner of the home whose privacy was being invaded yes surveillance cameras are important to deter crime it is important to note who is at the other end of the camera who really is watching you who ultimately views what the camera lens observes who decides when a privately owned security surveillence camera is poorly aimed and when the same camera is deliberately pointed into the windows of a private residence a litmus test should be considered as a tool for deciding a cameras purpose and value in society i will add that gender age and disability all play a key role who draws the line between public interest and harassment at the moment nobody it is a case by case decision the camera in this case the police decided that despite obvious visual observance the camera was not breaking any lawsit was of public interest just as a red light camera was rote cited by the constitution this camera the owners were also protected the cameras owners could legally do what a peeping tom could not do they could peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side through protecting the rights of the public interest of all surveillance cameras police in this unnamed massachusetts towncity have allowed for a legal loophole with electronic peeping toms if a person were standing watching outside a window it could be a crime yet same person could place a surveillance camera then remotely view a person within the privacy of their home most important it is not against the penal code yes public interest and safety along with surveillance cameras are here to stay the definition of a public camera for public interest vs a private surveillance camera placed for bad bad behavior has a very blurry line ask me i live it four privately owned security cameras deliberately aimed to vew inside of my windows invade my privacy within my own domain has a fact of life but i am am not allowed to write about it for fear of safety and monetary reasons the camera owners private citizens are bringing a lawsuit against me for harassing themhow did i harass you ask by placing personal identifying information in view of said camera thus rendering any pictures useless privately owned operated surveillance cameras are treated the same as public cameras who really is watching you who owns that camera anyway big brother or harassing neighbor cameras  security camers cameras  secur not

surveillance is its assumed deterrent effect despite claims by police private security and camera technology companies deterrence has not been proven there may well be more evidence that cameras have little to no deterrent effect since crime rates and other indicators used to measure deterrence fluctuate greatly after camera surveillance installation at best deterrence can be achieved only in

themselves but actually criminal can get weapon easily if everyone has the weapon criminal can buy a gun from shop like buy a piece of cake and no one knows the man is a criminal before he uses the gun moreover citizens cannot bring the gun with them every day but criminals could so the weapon brings more damage than benefits for instance in december 14 2012 a school shooting happened in sandy hook elementary school the criminal adam lanza killed 20 firstgrade children and four teachers by rifle then he killed himself by his handgun i believe most of teachers in this school have guns but they won’t bring it to school everyday which means their guns can be only used for hunting or fun not protect themselves but criminals do the the crime and bring the gun whenever they want it’s hard for citizens to prepare and ready for these sudden crime even though citizens can bring guns with them everyday but do they have courage to fire back or use the gun point someone i think the answer would be no because we are living in a real world not in movie yizheng li yizheng li not verified said at 1043 am on november 25th 2014ban weapon is a big deal to stop the crime americans always

civilian heroes are made up by writers or artist we can rarely see heroes in our life and most people would be freak out or just huddle in the corner they do not have the courage to fire the gun so if we don’t ban guns criminals can easily get the weapon to commit crimes and they dare to kill anyone who stand on their way
