httpwwwneurologyindiacomtextasp201159112076893» introduction spontaneous pneumorrhachis is very rare most cases of pneumorrhachis are secondary to medical procedures trauma pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum 1 we report a patient with air in the spinal canal and intradiscal spaces associated with grade 1 spondylolisthesis and discuss the probable mechanisms of spontaneous pneumorrhachis» case report a 51yearold man presented with history of chronic low back pain no past history of surgery or trauma was present neurologic examination was essentially normal magnetic resonance imaging mri of the spine showed grade 1 anterolisthesis of l5 over s1 vertebra disc herniation at multiple levels figure 1 a for bony details computerized tomography ct was done which showed vacuum phenomenon in all the lumbar intervertebral discs figure 1 b linearly placed air pockets were noted within the spinal canal anterior to the thecal sac from l5 to s1 levels figure 1 b a diagnosis of pneumorrhachis was made there was also grade 1 anterolisthesis of l5 over s1 figure 1 c with spondylolysis figure 1 d the patient was planned for surgery for the correction of spondylolisthesis which was the cause of back pain figure 1 a t2w sagittal image of mri shows disc herniation at multiple levels with grade 1 anterolisthesis of l5 over s1 vertebra b ct sagittal bonyreconstruction shows

was first reported by gordon et al in 1977 2 and newbold et al 3 introduced the term pneumorrhachis in 1987 there were documentation of very few cases since then the etiologic factors include spontaneous pneumomediastinum traumatic pneumothorax skull fracture epidural anesthesia radiation therapy and thoracic surgery 4 spontaneous pneumorrhachis denotes nontraumatic noniatrogenic air within the spinal canal and is a very rare occurrence different pathways of air entry into the spinal canal are postulated according to coulier 5 the pathogenesis of pneumorrhachis is due to valve pump mechanism or ball valve effect wherein the gas collected in the clefts of a longstanding diseased disc is expulsed through a weak spot or rent in the annulus fibrosus as a sequelae to disc degeneration the radiological findings of vacuum phenomenon with degenerative discs were described by knutsson 6 in 1942 marr 7 in 1955 found gas in the intervertebral disc in 2036 of his cases whereas gershoncohen et al 8 found the vacuum phenomena in 208 of their cases according to gulati et al 9 the vacuum phenomenon is due to creation of space in a degenerative intervertebral or apophyseal joint due to motion especially extension the expanded space thus created is filled with gas evolved from the surrounding extracellular fluid gas in the intervertebral joint space was analyzed by ford and colleagues 10 and was found to contain 90−95 nitrogen according to kim 11 intradiscal gas accumulation and repeated microtrauma causing erosive defects in the endplatesdetachment of annulus lead to pneumorrhachis similarly in our case all the extra discal air must have migrated from the intradiscal vacuum adjacent to endplate in addition spondylolisthesis might have contributed to the migration of air into the spinal canal most of the time it is asymptomatic kyungjin song et al 12 reported a case of spontaneous extradural pneumorrhachis causing cervical myelopathy ct spine is the imaging modality of choice 13 most authors recommend conservative treatment for the intraspinal gas 11 bosser et al 13 reported ctguided aspiration of pneumorrhachis but in his case epidural gas recurred and was subsequently removed by surgical treatment the aspiration was considered incomplete treatment since the origin of the air still remained if there is causative neurological deficit or frequent recurrence surgical decompression using the lateral transmuscular approach can be done 14 pneumorrhachis usually represents an asymptomatic epiphenomenon but can also be symptomatic by itself as well as by its underlying pathological causes the diagnostic procedure should include spinal ct which is the imaging modality of choice it should be differentiated from free intraspinal gas collections which can be due to degenerative malignant inflammatory and infectious diseases by gasforming organisms a multidisciplinary approach is required for the management which is mainly directed to the associated pathologies to enable adequate therapy» references1 manden pk siddiqui ah pneumorrhachis pneumomediastinum pneumopericardium and subcutaneous emphysema as
