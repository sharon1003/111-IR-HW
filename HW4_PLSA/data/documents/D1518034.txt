separate entity and must be managed separately for example to receive the maintenance benefits provided by features and tools such as windows update and antivirus programs you must install and run them in the guest operating system tools and features that run in the host operating system have no affect on the guest operating system note the notification area of the host operating system may include icons of programs running in a virtual machine for these programs the tooltip includes remote to help you identify which programs are running in a virtual machine if the same program is running in both the host and guest operating systems the notification area shows two instances of the same icon for example this happens if you run the same antivirus program in both operating systems
