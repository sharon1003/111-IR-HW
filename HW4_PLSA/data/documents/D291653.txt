march 19 2015  posted in marijuana  by jerry cox from timetotime proponents of marijuana legalization throw out some fuzzy statistics claiming no one has ever died from marijuana caseinpoint earlier this month a group in arkansas advocating major changes in our state’s marijuana laws tweeted the following alcohol kills 88000year in the u s it’s not even a medicine no one has died from cannabis—ever tom cotton ar get educated arpx arnews— ar compassion arcompassion march 12 2015“no one has ever died from cannabis” let’s investigate this claim unpacking the statistics on alcohol and marijuana in the tweet above arkansans for compassionate care is apparently citing a statistic from the center for disease control on the number of deaths from alcohol every year 88000 on average if we read how the cdc arrived at that figure we see it was by calculating the number of alcoholrelated accidents and health problems in other words it isn’t simply that 88000 people die from blood alcohol poisoning which some might describe as an “alcohol overdose” each year alcohol is contributing to the deaths of about 88000 people each year in the form of heart and liver problems car crashes and so on these are what the cdc calls “alcohol attributable deaths”  you can see a full list of them here  they are deaths cause by something that was a direct effect of alcohol use so let’s take a look at marijuanaattributable deaths has marijuana really never killed anyone as so many of its proponents claim kevin sabet with smart approaches to marijuana did an interview with the daily signal last year in which he took the claim to task saying“saying marijuana…has never killed anyone is like saying tobacco has never killed anyone nobody dies from a tobacco overdose you can’t smoke yourself to death and yet nobody would dispute that tobacco causes death … you die from lung cancer–you don’t die from smoking you die from what smoking did to your lungs which is a direct effect from smoking and so in that same way marijuana does kill people in the form of mental illnesses and suicide in the form of car crashes … you can’t say marijuana doesn’t kill”you can watch the entire interview

foia responses from 1997 to 2005 the fda recorded 279 marijuanarelated deaths–long before colorado voters decided to legalize the drug we have brought up many of these statistics before in our discussions on marijuana each time we did marijuana supporters tried to evade by arguing that marijuana hasn’t caused as many deaths as other drugs however there is a world of difference between claiming marijuana has never killed a single person and claiming marijuana has not killed as many people as other substances emergencies caused by marijuana besides death marijuana has caused or contributed to many welldocumented emergencies some of these emergencies easily could have resulted in death or serious injury here are just a few examples of emergency situations caused by marijuana

twoyearold in colorado overdosed and was hospitalized after eating a cookie laced with marijuana news outlet indicate the girl found the cookie in the yard of an apartment complex recurring themes kids and accidental overdoses a recurring theme in many of these news stories is that children and teens are becoming severely ill after ingesting marijuanalaced food often referred to as “edibles” in july of 2013 researchers writing in jama pediatrics determined accidental ingestion of marijuana by young children is on the rise and carries serious risks the greatest dangers appear to be toddlers and young children who accidentally find cookies or candy laced with marijuana and teens acquiring marijuana edibles at school without realizing how potent the druginfused food is in both scenarios children accidentally overdose on marijuana and must be taken to the er in some cases as noted above the children even pass out or become unresponsive a child who loses consciousness from marijuana overdose could easily fall and strike their head or suffer another serious injury a teen who ingests a marijuana edible–without realizing its potency–before climbing behind the wheel of a car to drive away from school could easily be involved in a serious traffic accident sideeffects may including exploding apartments a few of the cases we have cited include explosions caused by marijuana hash oil operations many marijuana users produce their own hash oil at home by extracting the oil from marijuana using flammable chemicals like butane in many cases the room fills up with butane and is ignited by a stray spark causing a serious explosion the people most atrisk are apartment dwellers a person who lives in an apartment complex may have their home destroyed because a neighbor’s hash oil operation exploded in washington at least one person was actually killed as a result of a hash oil operation that exploded in a neighbor’s apartment the legality of hash oil extraction is questionable under state laws in washington colorado and elsewhere colorado’s attorney general released an opined in december that home production of marijuana hash oil is illegal however many people disagree regardless of its legality it is clearly dangerous to the marijuana users and their family members and neighbors conclusion marijuana has caused far more than 0 deaths given the amount of evidence–both scientific and anecdotal–there simply does not seem to be any way around it marijuana is responsible for many deaths moreover marijuana has caused numerous medical emergencies that could have been fatal under different circumstances we continue to say it over and over again marijuana may be many things but “harmless” simply is not one of them related posts marijuana causing overdoses
