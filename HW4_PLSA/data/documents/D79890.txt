prescription i have trouble falling asleep at night let alone staying asleep once i do doze off i was recently prescribed trazodone for anxiety and the insomnia while i do sleep well which could be the understatement of the millenium i have noticed that the sleepy effect carries over into the day also i do not seem to remember much shortly after taking the pill at bed time and have been told of things ive done or conversations ive had that i do not recall i am wondering if these are typical side effects of trazodone or is the 50mg dose i take too much answer this question report favorite responses 2ka kaismama 3 apr 2014its typical if youre trying to function right after you take it take it and go to bed the morning groggies is a fact of these meds i find that if i get moving and have a cup of coffee it clears 50 mg is not a high dose you could ask your dr if you can decrease to 25 mg until you get used to it votes 0 comment vote up report el eliza jane23 5 apr 2014try taking the trazodone along with melatonin melatonin is what our brains make to put us to sleep you can very slowly increase up to 10 mgs of melatonin per night you may not need anywhere near that amount so start with 2 mgs or 3 mgs if the melatonin makes you sleepy sit in sunlight for 20 minutes each morning  your brain will burn off the excess melatonin regards  ej23votes 0 comment vote up report ma mapyron 7 apr 2014every one is different it appears insomnia has been my bedfellow since i was a teenager from time to time sometimes related to stresses and worries in my lifesometimes not i did take tramadol a few years ago during an extremely stressful time i could only sleep about 4 hrs at nightand kept waking up at 3 amready to go i honestly hated the drugged out feeling that i felt in the day from tramodol think i took 50100 mg at night it was hard to think the next dayi sure wouldnt be surprised about not remembering while taking that drug though it did help me sleep somewhat longer the sleep was not good sleep for me i have taken klonopin off and on mostly on for years and if i dont take it i cannot sleep a decent amount of time but even benzos can at times keep away deep sleep melatonin would put me to sleep but it didnt last many hours and i did feel funny after using it awhile expand on only34me 2 jul 2014i also take trazadone 200 mg at night i cannot get out of bed in the morning i get my kids off to school and then come home and nap on school nights i take 100 mg but dont sleep well it is worth it because it is much easier to be less groggy in the morning i usually wake up between 300  400 am the problem i have is i have also read that trazadone is used as an antidepressant as well so i do question the effect it has by decreasing it on only34me 2 jul 2014i would also like to add that i too have conversations and and do things i dont remember i slur and my kids tell me i act wasted after i take it i cant even walk sometimesma mapyron 2 jul 2014i see that i kept saying tramadol instead of trazedone good example of my mental state  i have a friend that loves her trazedone for night and really wouldnt give it up i think she also takes zoloft and wellbutrin in the morningdont know the dosage it sure isnt recommended to use ssris snrisand tryciclics  i know trazadone is an old drug so that part is a guessbut it is for sure different class trazadone is really recommended for major depression i do agree it makes you sleep because it drugs you plus it has a long metabolic life too the major problem is figuring out where the insomnia is coming fromsometimes you just cannot figure that out but in the long run trazadone for insomnia is just a bandaid and doesnt really improve the problem ly lynnoffcym 12 jan 2015i think the answers you got show a lot of experience with trazodone there are certain ways you can train yourself to help sleep getting up at the same time every day helps you go to sleep at the same time melatonin can be a big help once you get in a routine of getting up in the morning try to get in a routine of going to sleep at the same time most people find limiting caffeine to 50mg a day half a cup of coffee helps when you get through the withdrawal of not having caffeine caffeine should be consumed no later than 12 hours before your bedtime exercise is essential i had trouble with sleep for decades i dont know whether i have a healthy sleep routine now has to do with growing older or just growing healthier i know it is the pits not being able to sleep especially chronic lack of good sleep it is difficult to manage any mental health issues if you are not getting proper sleep i know from experience unfortunately as far as trazodone is concerned you have to weigh benefits with side effects no easy answers
