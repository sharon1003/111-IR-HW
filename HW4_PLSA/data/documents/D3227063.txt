their budget but we need this information if were to make a well informed decision please keep in mind that the below numbers are for 3 large dogs darwin’s natural pet products our raw dog food provider offers the following feeding guidelines to customers as a general rule a typical adult dog will consume 24 of their body weight per day smaller dogs eating a higher percentage while bigger dogs eat a lower percentage of their body weight in weekly and monthly 4 week terms a 10 lb dog will eat about 212 lbs per week of darwin’s fresh dog food or 10 lbs per month a 25 lb dog will eat about 5 lbs per week of darwin’s fresh dog food or 20 lbs per month a 50 lb dog will eat about 8 lbs per week of darwin’s fresh dog food or 32 lbs per month a 75 lb dog will eat about 1012 lbs per week of darwin’s fresh dog food or 42 lbs per month a 100 lb dog will eat about 13 lbs per week of darwin’s fresh dog food or 52 lbs per month when i saw this i determined that our dogs couldn’t eat a full raw diet because we couldn’t afford it but i was wrong it’s still expensive but let me show you how i was able to figure out what we could afford darwin’s natural pet products v three adult dogs rodrigo 75 lbs sydney is 75 lbs blue is 50 lbs  200 lbs of dogs x 2  4 lbs of food per daywe have large dogs so it was suggested that we use 2 to determine their daily consumption darwin’s products come in ½ pound servings of raw dog food 4 servings make up one package 2 lbs that you can divide easily to get what your dog needs our dogs share 2 packages a day 28 packages every two weeks our order contains 20 packages every other friday for 151but there are 30 days on average in a month…what i’ve learned is that our dogs don’t always eat their food how many times have you skipped breakfast or dinner because you’re tired too hot or you’d rather hunt for wabbits since it’s raw food i’m not going to allow it to sit out for long we give them two opportunities to eat and if they don’t then it waits for the next meal our dogs are not starving we see this mostly on hot days they’d rather just drink and i give them a little food and pumpkin  plain yogurt pops also great for upset tummies we also add ground turkey to their raw food 7 days per month not on a set schedule ground turkey isn’t subjected to hormones you can buy it in bulk at costco but it’s actually cheaper at our local grocery store when it goes on sale i stock up our raw dog food budget is about 325 per month wow they eat better than we do right this is the dollar amount that stopped me from switching to raw dog food 325 per month that’s ridiculous i can’t afford that but then i started paying attention to what i was paying at the pet store and that changed my mind our monthly budget on kibble including sales tax was about the same i was buying 2 large bags of premium dry kibble and then a lot of extra stuff each month at the pet store grocery store and costco to make the kibble edible because our dogs crave variety i know that eventually they would eat but i wanted our dogs to enjoy their food – they didn’t isn’t raw dog food supposed to be cheaper yes but we order our food and what’s included in the cost is the preparation packing and shipping many raw feeders who are making the food at home are spending half as much for multiple large dogs and i’m hearing that there are butchers who have a raw food section of their store to provide meat to these families wow talk about being progressive also keep in mind that i’m feeding three large dogs its’ significantly cheaper for one dog recently i received the following comment over on a blog post on keep the tail wagging…“i just recently switched my four labs to raw i switched mainly due to one of the dogs suffering from bloat and ibs hes doing a m a z i n g on the raw diet…i just wish i would have switched earlier when it comes to cost…i am saving so much money i can barely believe it myself previously we fed a premium dog kibble and bought 4 bags each month i also had to feed my bloaty lab 30 cans of premium canned food in addition to his kibble and in addition to all that…i topdressed their meals with apple and yogurt in the morning and green beans and a premium wet food in the evening i spent about 350 a month on dog food before…and now with raw it costs about 160 a month for all for labs”  tina other cost savings to consider…vet bills by taking care of our dog’s health and nutrition today we’re reducing the amount of vet bills tomorrow this is why i’m very careful when it comes to vaccinations each of our dogs takes daily joint supplements and i’m now hesitant to feed them overly processed food im still considering preparing food myself but im not ready to make that step yet i want to learn more about what i need and where i can get the ingredients plus theres the matter of storage our freezer now accommodates the raw dog food but ill want a separate freezer we live near an appliance outlet so we can get one for a song should i decide to make the food myself how i can afford our raw dog food budget…blogging although there are plenty of people out there willing to tell you that you cant get rich from blogging there are plenty of other people who are doing really well with their blogs i now have two blogs that bring in enough money monthly to cover their upkeep marketing and our dogs food i think there are many side gigs out there that we can take on that will help us swing a raw food budget but the best route is to do it yourself stay tuned because ill be posting lots of information for families who want to do just that wow 160 a month for 4 dogswhat are your thoughts id love to hear your experience opinions and questions9 comments tina b on june 21 2013 at 904 pm no one was more surprised than me when i discovered how much money i was going to save by making my own dog food i’ve yet to find a grocer that will grind chicken…they will grind beef or pork tho’ and i’m looking for a grocer who gives away cut off’s for free…pieces of chicken like the neck back and wing tips i priced several frozen raw and dehydrated raw dog food products it seemed the cost to feed one 7075lb dog was about 165 per month that might not be too bad if i had one dog but i have four hungry mouths to feed i decided to try raw food for my bloatibs dog…just to see if it could help his issues if he liked the raw diet and showed improvement i figured i switch all of my dogs his health improved so quickly i knew raw was the way to go with the other dogs too i am still finding my groove when it comes to making the dog food it’s a learning process for sure it takes me about 5 hours total to make approximately 10 days worth of food i buy 40lbs of meat at a time and get most of my ingredients at the grocery store i do buy 3 or 4 ingredients at a local health food store before i can begin mixing the recipe i have to cut the meat into pieces small enough to fit into my grinder…a small chicken leg including bone will fit thru without having to be trimmed this cutting process takes about one hour…40 pounds is a lot of meat then i have to semifreeze the meat so that it goes thru my grinder easily this takes about 1 12 – 2 hours then i grind all 40lbs of meat…if all goes well this takes about one hour after that it’s blending time my recipe calls for 4lbs of meat…so i make the same recipe ten times i cut my veggies and chop them in the food processor then add the rest of the ingredients to the processor and give it a good mix then i blend the veggie mix with 4lbs of ground meat what does it look like think a delicioussmelling meat loafi bought a few rubbermaid 40cup tubs to store the food they cost about 12 each at walmart and home depot the ones at home depot come in a set with about 20 other pieces for the same price after mixing the food i put one tub in the frig for immediate use and the rest go in the freezer i pull one out of the freezer the day before i need it so it has time to thaw before it’s needed each tub lasts my four dogs almost 3 12 days and if i mix 40lbs of meat then i get enough to feed my four dogs for 10 days i thought making my own dog food would be a pain in the tucus but it’s not yes it takes up a good part of an afternoon to make a batch but i figure i can find a few hours 3 times a month to ensure my dogs are getting a good wholesome food to be honest i live in a rural area and have access to only a handful of pet stores i could never be sure they would have my brands of dog food 2 different ones in stock so i generally ordered my dog food and had it delivered the time it took to price shop the net hope that it was in stock and could be delivered before i ran out…oy it’s much less stressful and time consuming to shop the grocery store and purchase the dog food ingredients while i’m shopping for the family as an added bonus there’s no dog food recall to worry about i’m positive the switch to raw food will save me a boatload of money at the vet too…especially with my bloatibs dog i look forward to seeing the long term effects of switching him to something his tummy can process more efficiently i look forward to hearing how other people mix their dog food and the recipes they use i’d also like to hear what health benefits they see in their dogs reply kimberly on june 22 2013 at 534 pm thank you so much for sharing these great details love itreply mike on january 28 2018 at 611 pm unfortunately the more popular raw becomes or has become raw dog food manufactures are jacking up the prices the place i order from has raised the prices 3 times last year and raised them again this year already it’s become absurd reply will on april 24 2017 at 934 pm it would be great to get an update now that you’ve been doing it for a while have you landed on any specific recipe or practices that you find are working well for your dogs i’ve read things about the thinner soft bones being good when they’re uncooked – like chicken backs and turkey necks i’m not sure how i feel about going that route but i do love my dog so i probably would if its what is best for him do you have anything else you could share reply kimberly on april 25 2017 at 820 am hi will – check out my current raw feeding from a to z series i’m updating everything this month so great
