city20th century henry fords first attempt at a car company under his own name was the henry ford company on november 3 1901 which became the cadillac motor company on august 22 1902 after ford left with the rights to his name 11 the ford motor company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with 28000 in cash from twelve investors most notably john and horace dodge who would later found their own car company during its early years the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on mack avenue and later its factory on piquette avenue in detroit michigan groups of two or three men worked on each car assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for ford within a decade the company would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept and ford soon brought much of the part production inhouse in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era henry ford was 39 years old when he founded the ford motor company which would go on to become one of the worlds largest and most profitable companies it has been in continuous family control for over 100 years and is one of the largest familycontrolled companies in the world the first gasoline powered automobile had been created in 1885 by the german inventor carl benz  benz patentmotorwagen  more efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for the middle class to which ford contributed by for instance introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at the ford factory in highland park between 1903 and 1908 ford produced the models a b c f k n r and s hundreds or a few thousand of most of these were sold per year in 1908 ford introduced the massproduced model t which totalled millions sold over nearly 20 years in 1927 ford replaced the t with the model a the first car with safety glass in the windshield 12 ford launched the first lowpriced car with a v8 engine in 1932 in an attempt to compete with general motors midpriced pontiac oldsmobile and buick ford created the mercury in 1939 as a higherpriced companion car to ford henry ford purchased the lincoln motor company in 1922 in order to compete with such brands as cadillac and packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market in 1929 ford was contracted by the government of the soviet union to set up the gorky automobile plant in russia initially producing ford model a and aas thereby playing an important role in the industrialisation of that country 13the creation of a scientific laboratory in dearborn michigan in 1951 doing unfettered basic research led to fords unlikely involvement in superconductivity research in 1964 ford research labs made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum

research and development facility in the country 62the ford research center in aachen germany at first ford in germany and ford in britain built different models from one another until the late 1960s with the ford escort and then the ford capri being common to both companies later on the ford taunus and ford cortina became identical produced in left hand drive and right hand drive respectively rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the uk switched to elsewhere in europe including belgium and spain as well as germany the ford sierra replaced the taunus and cortina in 1982 drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling which was soon given nicknames the jellymould and the salesmans spaceship in february 2002 ford ended car production in the uk it was the first time in 90 years that ford cars had not been made in britain although production of the transit van continued at the companys southampton facility until mid2013 engines at bridgend and

class car the bmax 63its 1959 anglia twodoor saloon was one of the most quirkylooking small family cars in europe at the time of its launch but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with british buyers in particular it was still selling well when replaced by the more practical escort in 1967 the third incarnation of the ford escort was launched in 1980 and marked the companys move from rearwheel drive saloons to frontwheel drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector the fourth generation escort was produced from 1990 until 2000 although its successor – the focus – had been on sale since 1998 on its launch the focus was arguably the most dramaticlooking and finehandling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next generation focus at the end of 2004 the 1982 ford sierra – replacement for the longrunning and massively popular cortina and taunus models – was a stylesetter at the time of its launch its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy sharpedged cortina and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold a series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the frontwheel drive mondeo at the start of 1993 the rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw ford enter the minicar market in 1976 with its fiesta hatchback most of its production was concentrated at valencia in spain and the fiesta sold in huge figures from the very start an update in 1983 and the launch of an allnew model in 1989 strengthened its position in the

in ulsan south korea built the european ford cortina until 1974 when hyundai introduced their allnew hyundai pony in 1975 ford then developed a relationship with koreas oldest car manufacturer kia which built vehicles coengineered with mazda later selling the ford festiva from 1988–1993 and the ford aspire from 1994–1997 for export to the united states with the acquisition of a stake in

understanding mo u with the state of gujarat for the construction of an assembly and engine plant in sanand and planned to invest approximately us1 billion on a 460acre site 72fords market presence in the middle east has traditionally been small partly due to previous arab boycotts of companies dealing with israel ford and lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region 73 saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates are the biggest markets ford also established itself in egypt in 1926 but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment 74 fords distributor in saudi arabia announced in february 2003 that it had sold 100000 ford and lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in november 1986 half of the ford and lincoln vehicles sold in that country were ford crown victorias 75 in 2004 ford sold 30000 units in the region falling far short of general motors  88852 units and nissan motors  75000 units south america during much of the 20th century ford faced protectionist government measures in south america with the result that it built different models in different countries without particular regard to rationalization or economy of scale inherent to producing and sharing similar vehicles between the nations in many cases new vehicles in a country were based on those of the other manufacturers it had entered into production agreements with or whose factories it had acquired for example the corcel and del rey in brazil were originally based on renault vehicles in 1987 ford of brazil and ford of argentina merged their operations with the brazilian and argentine operations of volkswagen group forming a new jointventure company called autolatina with a shared model range sales figures and profitability were disappointing and autolatina was dissolved in 1995 with the advent of mercosur the regional common market ford was finally able to rationalize its product lineups in those countries consequently the ford fiesta and ford eco sport are built only in brazil and the ford focus only built in argentina with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighboring countries models like the ford mondeo from europe could now be imported completely built up ford of brazil produces a pickup truck version of the fiesta the courier which is also produced in south africa as the ford bantam in right hand drive versions africa in africa fords market presence has traditionally been strongest in south africa and neighbouring countries with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent ford in south africa began by importing kits from canada to be assembled at its port elizabeth facility later ford sourced its models from the uk and australia with local versions of the ford cortina including the xr6 with a 30 v6 engine and a cortinabased bakkie or pickup which was exported to the uk in the mid1980s ford merged with a rival company owned by anglo american to form the south african motor corporation  samcor  76following international condemnation of apartheid ford divested from south africa in 1988 and sold its stake in samcor although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company 77 samcor began to assemble mazdas as well which affected its product lineup and saw the european fords like the escort and sierra replaced by the mazda based laser 78 and telstar 79 ford bought a 45 per cent stake in samcor following the demise of apartheid in 1994 and this later became once again a wholly owned subsidiary the ford motor company of southern africa ford now sells a local sedan version of the fiesta also built in india and mexico and the focus the falcon model from australia was also sold in south africa but was dropped in 2003 while the mondeo after briefly being assembled locally was dropped in 2005 the mondeo has since been reintroduced but badged as the fusion former operations east and southeast asia ford decided to shut down their entire

vehicles were assembled using imported knockdown kits 81 the factory subsequently produced 10000 model as up to 1936 production ceased in 1940 as a result of political tensions between japan and the united states after world war ii ford did not have a presence in japan as the ford facility was appropriated by the japanese government until 1958 when property was returned as a possession of the ford motor company and became a research and development location for ford partner mazda in 1979 ford acquired a 245 ownership stake in mazda and in 1982 ford and mazda jointly established a sales
