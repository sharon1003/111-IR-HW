bolt ev new electric cars compared the short answer is not within the next few months—but they should pay much closer attention to the numbers than they had to in previous years update we first published this article in july 2013 after five years of electriccar sales we updated it first in early 2016 and again in february 2018 it now reflects aggregate plugin electric car sales data through

qualify for the credits whereas a previous credit for purchase of a hybrid was capped at 60000 vehicles per carmaker plugin vehicles have a higher cap 200000 cars that applies to u s sales only once that number is achieved the credits start to phase out over a oneyear period in the second quarter for two quarters the credit is halved in the third quarter it is 25 percent of the original amount then it ends the relevant rules can be found on the irs website including the phaseout the qualified plugin electric drive motor vehicle credit phases out for a manufacturer’s vehicles over the oneyear period beginning with the second calendar quarter after the calendar quarter in which at least 200000 qualifying vehicles manufactured by that manufacturer have been sold for use in the united states determined on a cumulative basis for sales after december 31 2009 “phaseout period” qualifying vehicles manufactured by that manufacturer are eligible for 50 percent of the credit if acquired
