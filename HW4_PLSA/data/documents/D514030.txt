distributed denialofservice attack when hackers use a network of zombie computers to sabotage a specific web site or server the idea is pretty simple  a hacker tells all the computers on his botnet to contact a specific server or web site repeatedly the sudden increase in traffic can cause the site to load very slowly for legitimate users sometimes the traffic is enough to shut the site down
