the molecular weight or molar mass of a substance is the mass of one mole of the substance and can be calculated by summarizing the molar masses of all the atoms in the molecule components in dry air air is a mixture of several gases where the two most dominant components in dry air are 21 vol oxygen and 78 vol nitrogen oxygen has a molar mass of 159994 gmol and nitrogen has a molar mass of 140067 gmol since both of these elements are diatomic in air  o 2 and n 2 the molar mass of oxygen gas is 32 gmol and the molar mass of nitrogen gas is 28 gmol the average molar mass is equal to the sum of the mole fractions of each gas multiplied by the molar mass of that particular gas m mixture  x 1 m 1   x n m n 1wherex i  mole fractions of each gas m  the molar mass of each gas the molar mass of dry air is 289647 gmol composition and content of each gas in air is given in the figures and the table below see also air density at varying pressure density and specific weight at varying temperature diffusion coefficients for gases in air  dynamic absolute and kinematic viscosity prandtl number specific heat at varying temperature and specific heat at varying pressure  thermal conductivity  thermal diffusivity properties at gasliquid equilibrium conditions and air properties for other properties of air components in dry air volume ratio  molar ratio compared to dry air molar mass molar mass in air name formula molmol air vol  gmol kgkmol gmol air kgkmolair wt nitrogen n 2 078084 78084 28013 21873983 7552oxygen o 2 020946 20946 31999 6702469 2314argon ar 000934 0934 39948 0373114 129carbon dioxide co 2 000033 0033 44010 0014677 0051neon ne 000001818 0001818 20180 0000367 00013helium he 000000524 0000524 4003 0000021 000007methane ch 4 000000179 0000179 16042 0000029 000010krypton kr 00000010 00001 83798 0000084 000029hydrogen h 2 00000005 000005 2016 0000001 0000003xenon xe 000000009 0000009 131293 0000012 000004average molar mass of air 2896471 kg  22046 lb back to top air density the density of dry air can be calculated with the ideal gas lawρ  p  r t 1where p  pressure par air  28705  individual gas constant jkg kt  absolute temperature kexample the density of dry air at atmospheric pressure 101325 k pa 101325 pa and 0 o c  27315 k can be calculated asρ  101325 pa  28705 jkg k27315 k 1292 kgm 3water vapor water vapor is almost always present in air the content may vary and the maximum amount possible of water vapor in dry air depends on the temperature of the air water vapor  h 2o  is composed of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms hydrogen is the lightest element with a molar mass of 1 gmol while oxygen has 16 gmol thus the water vapor atom has an molar mass of 18 gmol and water vapor is lighter than o 2 with 32 gmol and n 2 with 28 gmol note water vapor in air will dilute the other gases and reduce the total density of the mixture dry air is more dense than humid airthe vapor in air may saturate to droplets when temperature is decreased or pressure is increasedmoist air  temperature and saturation pressure humid air containing water molecules as liquid  droplets  may be more dense than dry air or humid air containing water only as vapor
