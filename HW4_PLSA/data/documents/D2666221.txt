 linux reviews  software guides desktops kde vs gnome what linux desktop is the best gnome kde or something completely different what is a desktop anyway kde vs gnome what is the better desktop environment the future is freedesktop hardware requirements the best desktop1 what is a desktop anyway the term desktop refers to the graphical environment where you do your work the desktop usually consists of a workspace called the root window with pretty icons and quite possibly a menu that pops up when you click on it usually a panel on the top or the bottom andor top of the screen with a menu and a lot of other practical services you may never even notice the most important part of any desktop is the window manager this is the application that handles window placements and movements the window manager is what draws a border or no border around your windows and makes them maximize minimize moves and behave according to your preferences2 kde vs gnome what is the better desktop environment kde and gnome are complete desktop environments that consist of a large number of tightly integrated yet still separate pieces of software gnome uses a window manager called metacity kde uses kwin both these desktops can be used with any other window manager if you do not like the default choice linux is like lego you can build your own desktop environment both kde and gnome are just big packages with software aimed to look and feel the same way work well together and generally give you a nice experience if you dislike a component then replace it with something else its that simple application that are made for gnome or made for kde can be used with any desktop this only means that that the program use a set of library functions found in their underlying gnomelibs or kdelibs you do not need to use the actual desktops to use the applications software made for kde and gnome can be used with any window manager  desktop as long as you got the proper libraries installed there is no reason to use only applications made for the desktop you prefer the best software for one task is made for kde the best for another task is made for gnome use the best from both worlds both kde and gnome can be customized to behave exactly the way you want what desktop you prefer is your own choice and preference when in doubt try to learn both or experiment with other desktops remember nix applications are not locked to the desktop they are made for gnome applications can be used in kde and vice versa there is no best desktop but there is a desktop thats best for you its a matter of preference and hardware3 the future is freedesktop freedesktoporg is a software project aimed at developing shared technology standards for the x window system they provide common protocols like system tray protocol specification standard that allows developers to write a program that will work in kde gnome fluxbox and other desktops who follow the freedesktop recommendationsis a free software project to work on interoperability and shared technology for desktop environments for the x window system the most famous x desktops are gnome and kde but any developers working on linuxunix gui technology are welcome to participate4 hardware requirements desktop required ram required cpufluxboxidesk 48 100 mhz xfce4 128 200 mhz gnome 1x 256 500 mhz gnome 2x 384 800 mhz kde 3x 512 1 ghz these values are general rules of thumb kde will start on computer systems who should have been moved to museums long ago like a pentium 100 with 64 mb ram but it will run horribly slow any computer box can be used for the right purpose if you select software according to its capacity a pentium 100 will let your write email and surf the internet if you choose the mutt email client and the web browser lynx for a hot new box with lots of ram and a fast cpu i recommend kde 3x or gnome 2x gnome is bloated and kde is even more bloated this is great but all those fancy features demand more cpu and ram xfce4 is a very nice complete fast and lightweight desktop environment and is probably the best choice for old but not ancient hardware the rox desktop is another good light choice for really old hardware you should use something simple to draw icons on your desktop like idesk and a fast window manger like fluxbox based on blackbox  waimea or icewm5 the best desktop again try them all this is your choice there are plenty of livecd linux distributions that let you try both kde and gnome without installing anything at all knoppix is a nice alternative some people claim kde is the best choice for beginners is the linux desktop getting heavier and slower slashdotorglinuxworld kde 31 vs gnome 22 how gnome became lamewhy kde applications have a bright desktop future kde
