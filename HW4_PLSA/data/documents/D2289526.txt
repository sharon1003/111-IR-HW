the money spent can be used better elsewhere many consumers consider bottled water to be a part of their regular grocery expense over the last decade it has become a staple with the average american spending over 100 per yearper person it is our hope that some of you will change back to plain or filtered tap water by using refillable stainless steel bottles then take all those savings and use them to support a charity like the water project whose mission it is to reduce poverty and bring access to clean water to communities in need dont get us wrong we know bottled water can be a necessary convenience and there are even occasions when packaged water is required like in natural disasters etc when it is necessary we commend all consumers who practice responsible use of bottled water which includes purchasing pet bottles and recycling them if the convenience is something you just cant give up then why not consider offsetting the ethical cost of this water use by making an additional donation to a water charity most of us do have a choice as to how we spend the money we earn or receive thats the privilege of living in a society whose per capita income exceeds most of the globe however our earning should be paired with responsible spending particularly in the current economy part of that responsible spending could be limiting consumption of prepackaged water a step towards living a simpler greener life when we choose to spend money wisely we are able to give more freely to those in need we think skipping the bottle to save a live is a great choice we sincerely hope you will too
