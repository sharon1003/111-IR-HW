 – kryses 128 points 4 years ago if youre talking about how they move their heads its because they actually cannot move their eyes independently from their heads to be able to look at something they have to move their head to face it in smaller birds like pigeons they have their eyes situated on the sides of their head for a wide field of vision to protect them from predators however this also keeps them from having depth perception to compensate for this they move their heads a lot in order to create slight angular differences that their brains can process as depth birds have very flexible necks especially compared to mammalian necks and so moving their eyes isnt totally necessary when the same purpose can be fulfilled by simply moving their head if you moved your head the same way you move your eyes your movements would be pretty jerky toopermalink embed save give gold – inquisitiveidgit 29 points 4 years ago kryses nails it birds move their heads the way mammals often move their eyes in sharp stereotyped saccades not smooth continuous tracking motion remember that mammals are pretty amazing creatures neurologically speaking theres a reason the mongoose can kill the cobrapermalink embed save parent give gold – barc0de 29 points 4 years ago i have never been proud of being a mammal before cheerspermalink embed save parent give gold – dmd 4 points 4 years ago but were ninjaspermalink embed save parent give gold – airazz 16 points 4 years ago to add to this its also the reason why pigeons bob their heads back and forth while walking they dont bob it randomly they actually move the head forwards then hold it stationary while the body catches up that way their eyes stay stationary for a bit allowing them to see stuff it can be seen clearly in this video we dont do it because we an compensate the movement of the head by moving our eyes so they stay fixed on the subject the whole timepermalink embed save parent give gold – deleted 15 points 4 years ago if you moved your head the same way you move your eyes your movements would be pretty jerky too truer words friend truer wordspermalink embed save parent – brock n 6 points 4 years agohowever this also keeps them from having depth perception to compensate for this they move their heads a lot in order to create slight angular differences that their brains can process as depth i thought thats why we have 2 eyespermalink embed save parent give gold – the ghostof woody allen 7 points 4 years ago two eyes only provide depth perception when they are close together it is the minor differences in perception between the eyes that allows the brain to interpret depth as the eyes move farther apart it becomes more and more like two separate images that may or may not have some overlap in viewing angle depth cant be seen with this arrangement as the image appears flat as kryses said to compensate for this some birds make slight movements with their heads to create the effect of having depth of fieldpermalink embed save parent give gold – updatebjarni 2 points 4 years ago its rather having the eyes pointed at the same place that provides depth perception pigeons have their eyes pointing in opposite directions the distance between the eyes affects at what range of distances the depth perception works best  larger distance between the eyes gives better depth perception further awaypermalink embed save parent give gold – deaddodo   2 points 4 years ago the eyes have to have a converged field of view to provide two views at slightly offset angles if they dont you instead get a wide field of view and no depth perception its a trade off based on evolutionary needs more coveragemore accuracy this is also why theres no depth in your peripheral visionpermalink embed save parent give gold – deleted 3 points 4 years ago if you moved your head the same way you move your eyes your movements would be pretty jerky too yes we cannot move our eyes smoothly unless we are tracking a moving objectpermalink embed save parent – chucmorris 2 points 4 years ago wow its really hard or near impossible to do smooth movementpermalink embed save parent give gold
