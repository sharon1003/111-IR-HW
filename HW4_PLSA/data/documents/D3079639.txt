integration you can control your nest learning thermostat why you would want to do this related should you buy google’s nest learning thermostat in many of our articles here at howto geek we open with a quick explanation as to why you would want to do something and what benefit you’d receive from following along with our tutorial in this case the reason is particularly straightforward as it builds on on the investment you’ve already made in smarthome technology you buy a smart thermostat because you want to pull your phone out to check the temperature and adjust it without walking across your house you buy an echo because you don’t want to pull your phone out to do stuff you just want to yell commands at your alwaysattheready voice assistant combining the two means you can yell at your thermostat this is what the future looks like and now you can live in it what you need to follow along with this tutorial you’ll new two things first and most obviously you’ll need a nest learning thermostat the alexa integration works with all three generations of the nest thermostat so any model will do second you’ll need an alexaenabled device although most people think of the popular amazon echo when they think of alexa you can also access the alexa voiceassistant via the amazon fire tv 2nd generation and above amazon tap and amazon echo dot although with the fire tv and tap the voiceassistant mode is not alwayson but instead taptouse how to link your nest and alexa to link your nest thermostat with the alexa system you need to use either the alexa mobile app on your phone or tablet or visit echoamazoncom in your web browser even if you normally use the alexa app we’d encourage you to use the browser interface for this tutorial since entering login credentials in much more comfortable at a full keyboard give alexa permission to access the nest using the lefthand menu select “smart home” within the “smart home” menu scroll down to the second section labeled “device links” and look for the nest entry select “link with nest” clicking the link will kick you over to a page at homenestcom where you will be prompted to authorize amazon access to your nest account click “continue” when prompted log into your account using your nest credentials after logging in successfully you’ll see the following confirmation message you can double confirm the alexatonest link was successful by looking in the smart homes menu again now the link in the nest entry will read “unlink from nest” instead of “link with nest” search for the nest in the previous section we gave the alexaamazon system and the nest system permission to talk now we need to search for our actual nest thermostat to link it to our alexa system in the alexa app in the same smart home submenu we were just in you’ll find a section labeled “devices” at the very bottom select the link labeled “discover devices” after a minute or so of searching your nest thermostat should appear in the list of devices note that the name of the thermostat is inherited from the nest based on what you named the nest during the initial setup typically the name is based on the room the nest is installed in as that’s what the nest installation software encourages you to use how to adjust your nest with alexa now that your nest and alexa are on speaking terms you can use a wide variety of natural language commands to control the nest to use commands you need to address them towards the name of the thermostat–our thermostat is named “living room” if your thermostat is named “office” “downstairs” or the like substitute the name accordingly in the following commands“alexa set the living room to 70 degrees”it’s useful to note that unless you have multiple nest thermostats in your home then you generally don’t need to mention the thermostat by name you can adjust the temperature up or down with general commands like alexa turn the temperature up this will increase the temperature 2 degrees alexa turn the temperature down this will lower the temperature 2 degrees you can also instruct alexa to adjust the temperate by a specific amount or to specific set points alexa lowerraise the temperature by x degrees alexa set the temperature to x degrees alexa set thermostat name to x degrees for the most part you can use any natural language phrases involving turn up turn down raise lower increase or decrease will successfully trigger the corresponding action on the nest thermostat in fact there was only one command we could never get to work right and it appears it isn’t actually an available command “alexa what temperature is thermostat name”despite our best efforts to just get alexa to say “the thermostat is set at 65 degrees” or any other kind of statuscheck feedback no matter how we phrased the question she always interpreted it as “what temperature is it outside” and would promptly give us the weather report for our zip code as a final note there are a few specific instances when you cannot use alexa to control the nest thermostat if your nest thermostat is set to away autoaway or has been turned off then you cannot trigger any temperature changes with alexa until the thermostat is back in home mode or turned on also when the thermostat is in emergency heating mode or emergency shutoff mode the thermostat state cannot be overridden by thirdparty tools like alexa now that we’ve linked your nest thermostat and alexa adjusting the temperature in your home is as easy as complaining about how cold it is
