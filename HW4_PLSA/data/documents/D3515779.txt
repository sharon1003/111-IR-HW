whether you are involved in electric or glowpowered flight rechargeable batteries have a dramatic impact on the performance of your particular model combine the varying range of experience that someone might have before they even pick up a radio with the numbers of different battery types chemistries and capacity and it can be rather easy for someone to do the wrong thing when it comes to battery selection or maintenance quite often people may damage or otherwise reduce the life of their rechargeable cells before they even use them for the first time while it may seem like there are too many different types of cells and it might seem confusing knowledge is power these are three of the most common parkflyer battery packs each one has a slightly different capacity size connector and chemical composition you can see here how much smaller a comparable li po is versus a standard battery pack choosing the right pack for you regardless of what type of model you will be using your particular battery in there will undoubtedly be a number of different chemical compositions to choose from nickel cadmium ni cd nickel metal hydride ni mh and lithium polymer li po cells are currently the most commonly used but each needs to be charged discharged and stored differently on top of that each model may require a different cell count or battery configuration as well to determine what pack configuration you will need check the owner’s manual of your particular model for more info the battery you will need should be listed in the “items needed to complete” section of your manual battery basics one of the most common misconceptions about batteries and battery packs is that a battery pack is made up of one very large battery truth be known a battery pack is actually constructed from a number of individual batteries called cells that have been connected together to work as a single pack there are two ways that the cells can be connected together the first is called “series” where the positive terminal of one cell is wired to the negative terminal of another cell this method is used when you want to increase the output voltage of the total battery pack as the individual cell voltages are actually combined to create one large voltage output for example a 6cell ni cd or ni mh pack is made up of cells rated at a nominal 12 volts each when wired in series you take the individual voltage 12v in this case and multiply that by the number of cells in the pack 6 to get the total pack nominal voltage if you do the math you’ll see that a 6cell pack has a total nominal voltage of 72 volts this is the most common cell connection method found in the rc hobby while a battery may be a battery in many instances the connectors can vary quite a bit this battery from a hobby zone firebird commander 2 is similar in dimensions to the standard park zone j3 cub’s pack but the connector is significantly different here we have a winner the right battery with the right connector makes all the difference in the world the second way to build a pack is called “parallel” in this method you connect the positive terminal of one cell to the positive terminal of another and do the same with the negative terminals unlike a series connection that increases the voltage output of a battery pack wiring cells in parallel increases the total capacity of the pack much like the voltage calculation but to figure out what the actual end result capacity will be simply add the m ah rating  milliamp hour of the cells being paralleled together to figure out what the capacity of the pack is if you are using 2100m ah cells in a 2cell parallel pack commonly referred to as “2p” multiply 2100 by 2 and you will get a total capacity of 4200m ah just remember though a parallel connection does not change voltage so while you can get 4200m ah out of a 2p pack  the nominal voltage will remain the same chemistry class rechargeable receiver packs save you money in the long run and are generally lighter than equivalent alkaline packs as i mentioned before there are three major chemistry types used in constructing a rechargeable battery the first one is called nickel cadmium or ni cd pronounced nicad for short while not as commonly used as they once were there are still a number of ni cd packs sold and used each year ni cd batteries are relatively inexpensive but they have a number of negatives ni cd batteries need to be fully discharged after each and every use if they aren’t they will not discharge to their full potential capacity on subsequent discharge cycles causing the cell to develop what’s commonly referred to as a memory additionally the capacity per weight also known as “energy density” of ni cd cells is generally less than ni mh or li po cell types as well finally the cadmium that is used in the cell is quite harmful to the environment making disposal of ni cd cells an issue in fact several countries in europe have banned ni cd batteries for just this reason this ban is what sped up the demand for alternative cell types and the first to really answer the call was nickel metal hydride ni mh ni mh cells have many advantages over their ni cd counterparts with the removal of cadmium from the cell the ni mh cells were able to fill the need for industrial and hobbygrade batteries all over the world ni mh cell manufacturers were also able to offer significantly higher capacities in cells approximately the same size and weight of comparable ni cd cells ni mh cells have an advantage when it comes to cell memory too as they do not develop the same performance issues as a result of improper discharge care lithium polymer batteries have really taken a foothold in the air market due to their high capacities high voltage outputs and light weight a li po pack can weigh as much as 50 less than a conventional canstyle battery pack lithium polymer li po cells are the newest and most revolutionary cells to come to market li po cells typically maintain a more consistent average voltage over the discharge curve when compared to ni cd or ni mh cells add to that the higher nominal voltage of a single li po cell 37v versus 12v for a typically ni cd or ni mh cell making it possible to have an equivelant or even higher total nominal voltage in a much smaller package li po cells also typically offer very high capacity for their weight delivering upwards of twice the capacity for sometime ½ the weight of comparable performance ni mh cells and packs that’s right with li pos you can often achieve higher voltage and power output with more capacity in a lighter weight package with all of these benefits why aren’t li po packs more widely used with so much energy packed into such a small space there are some important safety measures to take when dealing with li po cells a li po cell needs to be carefully monitored during charging as overcharging a li po cell to beyond 42v or the charging of a physically damaged or overdischarged cell discharged to below 30v under load can be a potential fire hazard many li po batteries come with safe charging circuitry integrated into it this circuitry prevents over charging over discharging and in some instances helps to balance the pack out if your pack has a “charge” lead on it always charge through that connector while some battery chargers can charge either ni cdni mh or li po cells chargers that do all three major chemical types are starting to surface the dynamite vision peak ultra can charge your li po packs along with ni mh and ni cd batteries as well if you are going to go the li po route use a charger that can correctly charge them using a constant current constant voltage method of charging as li po cells can not be “peak charged” such as the vision peak ultra dyn4053 or the eflite celectra 13 cell charger eflc3005 not only must care be taken when charging li po cells but when discharging them as well you should never overdischarge a li po pack to below 30v per cell under load and you must use an esc programmed to provide the proper low voltage cutoff for your pack for example a 9v cut off for a 3 series li po pack also you should never dead short a li po pack even if only for an instant as the large amount of energy stored in the small package can catch fire quite quickly as a result while these seem like major deterrents to using a li po battery these usage guidelines are quickly becoming well known as they are typically well outlined in the instruction manuals included with most li po packs escs and li po chargers however with all of their performance benefits there is little doubt that lithium polymer battery packs are currently the future of battery technology for electric powered models to build or not to build some people prefer to assemble their own battery packs rather than buy preassembled packs before you solder on the cells scuff up the terminals to provide a better connection and more secure solder joint many people damage their battery packs before they use them for the first time with poor soldering techniques remember to use an iron with a large enough tip to transfer heat apply solder to the items being joined and not the iron itself and don’t hold the iron onto the battery for too long there are two different ways to purchase your batteries either as loose cells or as preassembled packs with individual batteries cells you’ll need to solder the cells together yourself to create your own battery pack the second option is to purchase a preassembled battery pack that comes with the pack preassembled and shrinkwrapped often times with the connectors prewired if you do not have much soldering experience andor do not have a highquality soldering iron it will generally be best to purchase a preassembled pack as a safety note you should never attempt to solder li po cells together into a pack configuration yourself li po cells are very susceptible to heat damage and excessive heat can cause them to possibly leak or even explode for this and other reasons most li po manufacturers willl offer preassembled packs only discharging and storage discharging and storage really go hand in hand for ni cd packs you should completely discharge them to 09v per cell before you store them ni mh packs should be stored with roughly a 50 charge in them for best performance and before you charge a ni mh pack for the first time in the day simply drain the pack completely on a discharger or in the model and you are then ready to charge the pack for use throughout the day li po batteries are completely different when it comes to discharging and storage depending on the output voltage of your pack you should only discharge your pack so far for example during use a 74v li po battery also known as a “2 series” or “2s” pack should never be discharged below 60 volts under load 30v per cell for storage of 2 weeks or more li po packs should be stored at approximately 38v per cell to prevent overdischarge or imbalance from developing among series cells in the packs due to differing levels of each cell’s selfdischarge rate in the case of a 2s 74v pack the pack should always be stored at 76v you should also store your li po batteries in a fireproof container or cabinet and never store your li po or any other battery for that matter in the model itself pehaps no other item has quite as much effect and influence on our hobby as rechargeable batteries do there are almost as many different theories and misconceptions out there about rechargeable batteries as there are individual battery sizes and types just remember that knowledge is key when it comes to batteries as is consistent charging discharging and storage whether you are in the hobby shop or at the flying field feel free to ask questions of those around you who may be more experienced that is one of the best ways to learn and grow in the hobby
