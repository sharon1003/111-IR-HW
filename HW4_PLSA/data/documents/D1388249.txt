related topics introduction region and language settings the region and language settings for your particular computer will have some impact on the way information is displayed in synthesis applications specifically they will affect which language is selected by default when you install the software how dates and times will be entered and displayed how decimal values and currency will be entered and displayed users with different regional and language settings can work together on the same analysis projects because in most cases the basic information is stored in the database and the software simply displays it in the format preferred by each user for example if the date september 25 2012 is stored in the database user a might see it as 9252012 while user b might see 25sep12 this topic first explains how to view or change the region and language settings on your computer and then discusses some specific considerations for synthesis applications viewingchanging the region and

the software the user interface for synthesis applications is available in several languages you can change this language at any time by opening the synthesis setup window  file  synthesis setup and selecting an option from the language dropdown list when you first install the software it will check your computer’s current language as it is set in the format field in the windows region and language window if that language is supported in synthesis synthesis will use those settings however if that language is not supported synthesis will use the default setting of english defining date and time formats dates and times appear frequently throughout the synthesis interface including but not limited to the dates in the plot legend area of a plot in all synthesis desktop applications the created and modified dates in many diagrams and in resources in all synthesis applications the history area of the record and item properties in xfmea rcm rbi and mpc the dates in the worksheet view and in the record properties windows in xfmea rcm rbi and mpc the dates in the dates of failure format and usage format of the weibull warranty folios the short date field from the windows region and language window determines how dates are displayed you can select any standard format eg mdyyyy ddmmmyy yymmdd or you can create your own format using the available date notations the short time field determines how times are displayed you can select any standard format eg hmm tt hhmm hh’h‘mm or you can create your own format using the available time notations the windows settings do not apply to the following items dates and times in spreadsheet utilities eg analysis workbooks general spreadsheets etc dates and times displayed in the weibull event log folio are created by the folio and are not affected by the computer’s settings changing the decimal symbol and the list separator how decimal values are displayed depends on the value of the decimal symbol field in the windows customized format window which determines which character is used to indicate the decimal portion of a number eg 8525 or 8525 in addition the character used to separate the arguments in a list depends on the value of the list separator field these settings affect how you enter functions in analysis workbooks and in general spreadsheets either manually or by using the function wizard for example if the decimal symbol value is a comma and the list separator value is a semicolon you would enter a function like this reliability folio1data 1 500 100 0 9 whereas if the decimal symbol is a period and the list separator is a comma it would be  reliability folio1data 1 500 100 0 9 setting the measurement system in the page setup on the margins tab of any synthesis application’s page setup window  home  print  page setup  the units field determines which unit of measure inches u s or centimeters metric is used for the page margins on print output the field includes the system’s default option selecting this option means that the measurement system used is determined by the value of the windows customize format window’s measurement system field and it will change if the computer’s settings change tip if you want the page margins to always be the same you can select a specific unit of measure and not use the system’s default option© 19922015 relia soft corporation all rights reserved
