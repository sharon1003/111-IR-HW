name of richmond berks as per the company’s official website richmond berks is an “international company that traces its history back to 2008”in addition to this the story for how the company came to be reads as follows –“two young businessmen john richmond and klint berks met at an auction fighting over one and the same lot one year later together with two other brokers they founded a company that specialized in purchase of real estate at auctions and its further resale at the secondary market in 2016 due to the conflict of interests richmond and berks sold their company shares and founded a new corporation – richmond berks this story lines up nicely with the fact that the richmond berks domain name for its website was registered back on september 29th 2016 but this is where things start to get rather suspicious after doing a bit of research on my part i wasn’t able to find any information at all on either john richmond or klint berks prior to the creation of richmond berks on top of this there isn’t any info on these two men outside of the richmond berks website at all there aren’t any bios for either of the two founds on the site either and this is all tied together with the fact that the domain name was registered privately what doe this result in unfortunately it’s a bit difficult to tell my best guess would be that john richmond and klint berks don’t actually exist and their names are simply being used as marketing for the richmond berks opportunity i’ve seen it done before and it sure does feel like this is what’s taking place here what is the richmond berks product line as for the product line that richmond berks has to offer we’re unfortunately met with more bad news similar to many other mlm opportunities that i’ve reviewed as of late richmond berks doesn’t have any sort of product line to offer to retail customers meaning that affiliates don’t have anything other than the affiliate membership itself to market and sell to possible buyers this is a theme and move that is usually only ever seen with underbelly scheme and scams and when you factor this with the lack of background info on the people who supposedly founded richmond berks the picture that’s being painted here starts to become very clear and easy to see what can you tell me about the compensation plan for richmond berks as for the compensation plan that richmond berks is marketing affiliates go about investing their real money into something that the company calls “richmond berks dollars” – also referred to as rbd this rbd is a type of virtually currency that is only used throughout the richmond berks opportunity meaning that it holds no sort of value at all in the real world affiliates are told that they can earn a daily roi of 14 by investing their money into richmond berks dollars and while all withdrawals within the company are paid out in usd there’s something very important to take note of here with any withdrawal requests that are made richmond berks holds onto 50 of whatever is being taken out so as an example withdrawing an earning of 100 will result in an affiliate only being able to pocket 100 referral commissions also exist here and they are paid out for two levels deep of recruitment and through the use of a unilevel system level 1 affiliates result in a commission payout of 10 of all invested funds in the company and level 2 lowers things to just 5 what will it cost to join richmond berks if you’re interested in becoming an affiliate for richmond berks for whatever reason the affiliate membership itself is free however in order to participate in the mlm opportunity that the company is offering you’ll first need to invest your dollars into the richmond berks dollars that i already outlined above is richmond berks a scam if you have heard that richmond berks is a scam then you’ve come to the right place to find out the truth what’s the truth – is richmond berks a scam i would say not exactly however there are some things to be aware of before joining which i have detailed in the conclusion you will only be successful by recognizing the weaknesses and finding a way to move past them conclusion for my richmond berks review once all is said and done just where does that put us with richmond berks the company is trying to sell the idea that the process of selling and buying realestate is taking place here but that simply isn’t the case let’s start out with the lack of background info once again there isn’t any available information at all of the company’s two main founders as if this wasn’t fishy enough on its own there’s also no info available on the sixteen total employees that are also listed on the richmond berks website speaking of the website there is a “public offer” document that’s hosted on it reading “richmond berks llc richmond berks is registered with the securities and exchange commission under the investment advisers act”oh really i did some research into the sec’s edgar database and after searching for both “richmond berks” and “richmond berks” i came up empty handed in other words richmond berks is lying about their involvement with the sec as if all of this wasn’t bad enough let’s no forget that there’s no retail sales activity at all and the investments of new affiliates are used to pay off commissions that are owed to existing ones this is where the ponzi nature of richmond berks is scene and as a whole it results in company that’s best left untouched the majority of people who get involved here will end up losing out in the long run and the only people who will likely end up making anything of real value will be the anonymous admin s behind the whole operation i definitely hope you have found value in my review of richmond berks i went into a lot of detail
