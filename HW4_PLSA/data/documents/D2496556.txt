fact there would be no advanced life forms on our planet manganese is essential for photosynthesis manganese dioxide makes the black color in black smokers – hot geothermal vents on the ocean floor image courtesy nasa cave paintings 16000 years old in lascaux france the black color was made by our ancestors using manganese dioxide discovery of manganese author dr doug stewart manganese compounds have been used since ancient times in the first century ad pliny the elder the roman author described how black powder manganese dioxide was used to manufacture colorless glass 1 it is still used for the same purpose today the first recognition of manganese’s existence as a distinct element was in 1740 when the german chemist johann heinrich pott stated that pyrolusite manganese dioxide contained a new earth metal until then pyrolusite was believed to have been a compound of iron pott prepared potassium manganate by fusing caustic potash potassium hydroxide with pyrolusite in air the color changes he observed in the product were greenblueredgreen establishing that pyrolusite did not contain iron 2 21 3details of the first isolation of metallic manganese were published in 1770 by ignatius gottfried kaim in a dissertation under the supervision of the chemist jakab jozsef winterl working in vienna kaim mixed powdered pyrolusite with twice its weight of black flux and heated the mixture strongly the composition of kaim’s flux is uncertain although it was probably based on charcoal a flux is a reducing agent if so the reaction would have been mn o 2  c → mn  co 2kaim described the product of the reaction as a bluewhitish shiny brittle metal with many differently shaped facets when broken and viewed sideon he observed blue flecks kaim claimed that no iron was present in his product but he was aware his manganese was not pure he invited other chemists to find a flux that could produce the pure metal 4 5in sweden carl wilhelm scheele – the discoverer of chlorine and one of oxygen ‘s independent discoverers – was aware that pyrolusite contained a new element his attempts to isolate it failed and he asked his friend johan gottlieb gahn to try gahn used a similar method to the one kaim had used a few years earlier with charcoal as the reducing agent gahn used a blowpipe to increase the temperature of the reaction the metal he produced was white hard and brittle when broken it had a granular structure gahn’s manganese was also impure but the new metallic element now gained widespread recognition 2manganese’s name comes from the use of its compounds in glassmaking these compounds were called ‘magnes’ in latin meaning ‘magnet’ 6manganese is not actually magneticinteresting facts about manganese manganese is an essential element in photosynthesis without it there would be no free oxygen on earth human bodies contain a tiny amount of manganese about 10 – 20 mg if you chopped a 10c coin into 100 equal pieces each piece would weigh more than the weight of manganese in an average human despite this we cannot survive without it manganese performs vital metabolic functions manganese in humans needs to be topped up frequently because our bodies cannot store it neanderthals may have used black manganese dioxide as a cosmetic 50 000 years ago 7 8colors on opposite sides of the color wheel cancel ever wondered how drink cans can be so thin manganese stiffens aluminum so less of it is needed to make soft drink cans elementary productions some oxidation states of kmn o4your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available

from 7 to 6 to 4 appearance and characteristics harmful effects excess manganese particularly inhalation of the powderdust is toxic exposure to manganese or manganese oxide s dust can result in a medical condition called manganism symptoms resemble those of parkinson’s disease workers at particular risk of exposure include miners and welders characteristics manganese is a graywhite hard brittle metal that can take a high polish it is not magnetic the metal tarnishes on exposure to air and when heated oxidizes to manganese ii iii oxide mn 3 o 4  like other transition metals manganese has more than one common oxidation state the most stable is 2 which is a pale pink color in aqueous solutions also important is 4 brownblack which is found in manganese dioxide and 7 found in the purple permanganate anion mn o 4 – manganese’s 6 oxidation state is green uses of manganese for over 2000 years manganese dioxide has been used to make colorless glass glass is made from sand silica and most sand contains iron ii oxide which naturally gives glass a green color it is sometimes incorrectly stated that the manganese dioxide oxidizes the iron ii oxide to iron iii oxide with a corresponding color change from intense green to pale yellow – and the pale yellow is too faint to be seen in fact the real reason the glass decolorizes is complementary colors colors that are directly opposite one another on the color wheel image left cancel one another out to leave a pale gray in glass the manganese dioxide forms a violet silicate which cancels the green color of iron ii 9manganese dioxide is also used as a blackbrown pigment in paint and as a filler in dry cell batteries the great majority of manganese ore ends up in steel production where the manganese desulfurizes and deoxidizes the steel it is also is used extensively to produce a variety of important alloys for example the aluminum used to make most soft drinks cans contains about 1 manganese to improve the cans’ stiffness and corrosion resistance organomanganese compounds can be added to gasoline to increase its octane rating and reduce engine knock manganese is the twelfth most abundant element in the earth’s crust and it is an essential trace element for all life on earth in the human body several manganesecontaining enzymes are need to metabolize carbohydrates cholesterol and amino acids typically our bodies have about 10 – 20 mg manganese this needs to be topped up frequently because our bodies cannot store it about a quarter of the manganese in our bodies is in bone while the rest is evenly distributed through our tissues 10abundance and isotopes abundance earth’s crust 01 by weight 360 parts per million by moles abundance solar system 10 parts per million by weight 02 parts

on the ocean floor but these are currently commercially unviable commercially manganese is produced by reduction of its ores using aluminum high purity manganese is made by electrolysis of manganese sulfate in solution isotopes manganese has 21 isotopes whose halflives are known with mass numbers 46 to 66 naturally occurring manganese consists of its one stable isotope 55 mn references s
