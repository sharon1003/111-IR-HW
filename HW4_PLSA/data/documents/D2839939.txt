between the cruze compact cars and the impala fullsize fourdoor chevy has used the malibu name for some aweinspiring land yachts since the 1960s the modern interpretation is a midsize stalwart with a decidedly less thirsty approach to fuel consumption—thanks turbochargers—and touchscreens it competes in the savage race for midsize money with the honda accord toyota camry nissan altima and hyundai sonata—just to name a few chevy saw it fit to leave the malibu as it is for the 2018 model year more read our 2018 chevrolet malibu review the new chevy malibu chevrolet introduced a new malibu for the 2016 model year it wears much more dramatic styling and sits atop a wheelbase thats been stretched by 4 inches compared to the current model which itself was shorter than its predecessor something customers apparently didnt appreciate standard models have a choice of turbocharged 4cylinder engines with a 15liter for base models and a 20liter available as an option the 15liter earns a 37mpg combined rating despite the size increase chevy claims a weight loss of about 300 pounds on comparable models theres also a new malibu hybrid this time with a system that goes beyond the mildhybrid setups offered in years past the new system is essentially based on the battery and motor set from the 2016 chevrolet volt the epa pegs fuel economy at 47 mpg city 46 highway 46 combined for its most efficient malibu which beats the ratings of the rest of the midsize hybrids in its latest form the malibu was a finalist for the 2016 north american car of the year its handsome inside and out and while it isnt a scorching performer it’s nimble confident and responsive in all of its variants the cabin is spacious and serene—and far more passengerfriendly than the previous model and with a host of new features including everything from blindspot monitors to apple car play the new malibu offers a lot of value for the money for 2017 chevrolet swapped in a 9speed automatic for its top 20liter turbo4 engine but base models make do with a 6speed a teen driver feature was added to notify parents of overeager children—or perhaps valet drivers chevrolet malibu history chevy has sold a vehicle named malibu since the 1960s but its evolved over time as tastes changed from the v8 and reardrive malibus of the 1960s and 1970s gave way to the downsized cars of the 1990s in 1997 the first modern malibu was introduced a replacement for the chevy corsica sedan this malibu was a smaller sedan than the most recent vehicle to wear the badge it also was engineered around a frontwheeldrive architecture the 1997 malibu was by all measures a bland car powered by an economical 150hp 24liter 4cylinder engine a version of gms muchmaligned quad four or 155hp later 170hp 31liter v6 which felt much stronger actually the malibu was only offered with a cushy suspension and 4speed automatic—and its interior though it had the comfort basics covered was drab and dull chevy dropped the 4cylinder engine completely in 2000 the malibu got a muchdeserved full redesign for 2004 built on a new global platform the 20042008 malibu was a bit more refined handled better and had a far nicer interior though it still felt too plasticky on the cheaper trims the malibu was a halfstep smaller than midsize entries like the toyota camry and honda accord yet its interior was surprisingly roomy and comfortable its powertrain lineup consisted of a nice fuelefficient 144horsepower ecotec 4cylinder with a manual gearbox possible or a v6 option that 201hp 35liter v6 was a little disappointing saved only by its prodigious torque a 4speed automatic was the only transmission and the combination just didnt feel very refined within this generation only chevy offered a hatchback version of the malibu it carried the odd name of malibu maxx and featured a longer roof and notquitewagon shape while it wasnt terribly sporty it was originally offered only with the larger engine a 36liter v6 chevy also added an ss variant of the maxx later in its lifecycle featuring a 39liter 240hp v6 that was pretty thirsty and not terribly thrilling the malibu boredom was remedied for 2008 when gm completely redesigned the model making it much longer to better match midsize rivals gm also gave it an interior and backseat space that outclassed many sedans its size the interior wore vastly upgraded materials and a design that was a clear step better than the layout of the former rentalcar favorite powertrains included a 169hp 24liter version of the ecotec 4cylinder engine and a 252hp dohc 36liter v6 a version of the engine previously used in the cadillac cts and srx among others for a short time a mildhybrid version of the 2009 malibu was offered it offered very slightly improved fuel economy over the 4cylinder versions and it failed to catch on it was discontinued after a very short production run chevy malibu 20132015the malibu thats on the way out after 2015 was just introduced for 2013 that car made a bit of an aboutface to focus more on efficiency in packaging and in fuel efficiency chevy chose to make it smaller than its predecessor—it was about 45 inches shorter in wheelbase than its predecessor—in order to make room for a new impala that was launched for the 2014 model year though smaller on the inside the new malibu boasted advanced safety tech and new infotainment features that are big improvements over the car it replaces a new trio of drivetrains was launched with the latest malibu making it a 4cylinderonly car like the hyundai sonata and ford fusion in 2013 the base engine was a 197hp 25liter inline4 but the first model to launch was the 2013 chevrolet malibu eco that highmpg model teamed a 24liter inline4 with a 6speed automatic and e assist technology that uses an electric motor and a small lithiumion battery pack to provide engine stopstart and electric assist for the gasoline engine active aero shutters and regenerative braking added up to better fuel economy of 37 mpg highway at the top of the lineup was a turbocharged 4cylinder with 259 hp good for a 060mph time of 63 seconds according to chevy and a higher grade of trim including standard 18inch wheels eight airbags including knee airbags were standard on this malibu and rear side airbags were an option bluetooth and a rearview camera were available as were a forward collision alert system and a lanedeparture warning system the malibu offered navigation and smartphone connectivity that allowed streaming of bluetooth audio and feeds from stitcher and facebook gm attempted to address several shortcomings of the relatively new malibu for the 2014 model year the car was given a mild exterior refresh with a new grille headlights and taillights inside the rear seat was reshaped to increase room for adults the suspension was also retuned with the goal of supplying better ride control for 2015 chevy further refined the malibus powertrain options the eco model was no longer offered while the turbocharged 20liter was reprogrammed to produce more torque with the figure rising to 295 lbft the malibu was capable of a 060 time of about six seconds the malibu also offered a highspeed data connection through atts 4g lte network which also allowed owners to set up an incar wifi network for mobile devices
