offroad mode the offroad mode refers to an additional lowrange set of gear ratios these make driving easier on difficult terrain and on very steep gradients together with 4motion fourwheel drive in the touareg this function enables the vehicle to make good progress over rugged ground in the touareg the lowrange ratio of 2661 for heavyduty offroad driving can be electronically activated via the suspension switch this provides maximum drive force at low vehicle speeds it enables the touareg to achieve a gradability of up to 100 percent 45° see also4motiongradability a b c d e f g h j k l m n
