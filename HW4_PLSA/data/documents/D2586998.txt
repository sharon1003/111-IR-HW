travel  ukfamily camping at goodwood revival april 30 2015  by mrs m  leave a comment you’ll have no doubt seen several posts from me on this blog about goodwood it’s fair to say i am a fan of their events today i am writing specifically about the goodwood revival and the family camping area goodwood revival is a completely different kettle of fish to the festival of speed fo s is definitely one for the speed freaks and petrol heads revival summed up in a word is ‘classic’ it’s a gloriously chic weekend packed full of historic motor racing great music and so much more it’s an amazing event for all the family many of people choose to dress up in vintage style and that’s what makes the event so unique it’s worth noting you don’t have to dress up if you don’t want to you certainly won’t be out of place if you don’t but it’s a nice thing to do and gets you more involved in the spirit of things part of the goodwood experience for me is the camping i’ve camped in many different locations nearby – from proper campsites to rather questionable pub fields but last year i attended the festival of speed and experienced camping at goodwood itself for the first time in fact it was the first time they had offered a dedicated family camping experience – and what an experience it was there wasn’t much i could fault to be honest camping isn’t for everyone i accept that but as camping goes this was a wonderfully civilised experience – peaceful surroundings respectful neighbours fabulously clean and equipped toilets hurrah a great children’s play area gourmet food on offer and of course the cherry on the top – a licensed bar if you want to read more about what i had to say about it at the time then you can do so herei am pleased to tell you that following excellent welldeserved feedback goodwood have now extended this fantastic feature to the revival event here’s what you get dedicated campsite manager for family camping camping area separated from other guests based at the racecourseshuttle bus to take you between the revival venue the motor circuit and your campsite onsite shop and catering plus lockable refrigerated storage space complimentary use of a playground if you want to find out more about the family campsite then you can their website here we’re pretty busy this year but we’re hoping to make it back to goodwood for the revival in september as we’ve not been now for about six yearsare you fan of camping are you indeed a fan of goodwood like me would love to hear your thoughtstagged camping family camping goodwood goodwood revival revivaluk
