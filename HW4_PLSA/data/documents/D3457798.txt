requirements user interface document splitting ↑overview you can split a currently open pdf document by selecting plugins  split documents  split document from the main menu use action wizard to split multiple files at once without opening them one at the time splitting methods equal page count ↑overview split pdf document into files containing equal number of pages per file split by page ranges ↑overview split a pdf document based on manually defined page ranges with a multitude of available options such as oddeven pages reverse order page ranges from individual bookmarks and etc this method provides a lot of flexibility and allows for the mixing of different page extraction methods from manually defined page ranges to page extraction by text and content split by bookmarks ↑overview split a pdf document based on specified level of bookmark hierarchy every bookmark section is extracted in a separate document and automatically named using the bookmark title in few seconds you get a set of documents that logically split the original file with every document even having a readable name auto split™ plugin can automatically create folders on a disk to mirror hierarchical structure of bookmark trees all output documents are instantly organized saving you many hours of work html index files can be automatically generated to provide easy file navigation stepbystep tutorial splitting documents by bookmarks split at pages with matching text ↑overview split large pdf documents containing groups of pages of variable lengths into separate files reports invoices billing statements can be efficiently processed with this splitting method the input document is first searched for pages that contain a user specified text pattern the document is then split into multiple files at the locations of those pages pages that contain matching text become first pages in the corresponding output documents a common approach is to match text that is present on the first page of every group of related pages such as invoice or report text search can be limited to a specific area on the page to eliminate unwanted text matches this operation can either combine multiple output documents into a single file based on the common search pattern or output separate documents the first option is useful when it is necessary to find and combine all pages that belong to the same account or person into a single document this processing method is available in auto split pro™ package only stepbystep tutorial splitting invoices by invoice or account numbers split at pages where text changes ↑overview split pdf files at pages where text within a userspecified area on the page changes example input pdf document of 11 pages has 3 separate invoices the goal is to split each invoice into a separate file each invoice may have more than one page and a number of pages per invoice is not known in advance first page or every page of each invoice contains an invoice number in the upperright corner and this number is always located within the same area this document can be easily split using pages where text changes mode by selecting a location where the invoice number is located the plugin will search all pages of the document and split at pages where the invoice number changes all pages from the change page and up to but not including the next detected invoice number will be included into a separate output file this operation can either combine multiple output documents into a single file based on the common search pattern or output separate documents the first option is useful when it is necessary to find and combine all pages that belong to the same account or person into a single document this processing method is available in auto split pro™ package only stepbystep tutorial split pdf files by client id example split at pages where text pattern changes ↑overview split pdf files at pages where a specific text pattern is changing the plugin searches all pages of the document for occurence of the userspecified text pattern regular expression syntax is used to define a pattern if a page is found with a matching text that is different from a previous match then a document is split at this page all pages from the detected page and up to but not including the next detected page will be included in a separate output file this operation can either combine multiple output documents into a single file based on the common search pattern or output separate documents the first option is useful when it is necessary to find and combine all pages that belong to the same account or person into a single document this processing method is available in auto split pro™ package only split by blank pages ↑overview split pdf document into multiple files at blank pages that serve as document separators every range of pages between blanks will be saved into a separate pdf document blank pages will not be included in the output documents pages should contain no pdf elements in order to be recognized as blank ones you can even split at blank pages that are scanned images in this case page should contain only a single image of the scanned blank page this powerful feature allows processing of batches of scanned fax pages user can adjust sensitivity of the algorithm to process images that contain some amount of noise this processing method is available in auto split pro™ package only stepbystep tutorial splitting documents separated by blank pages split by stamp annotations ↑overview use this splitting method when it is necessary to separate pages from a pdf document into several different documents based on stamp annotations the stamp annotation on a pdf is intended to be viewed just like an ink stamp on a paper document typically a user is reviewing documents and adds stamp annotations to a first page of each subdocument invoice loan application application form and etc for example a document contains multiple loan applications and reviewer stamps individual applications with either “approved” “rejected” or “for review” stamps by using this splitting method it is possible to create 3 different output documents grouping subdocuments based on a stamp first document will contain all documents stamped with “approved” second with “rejected” and a third one with “for review” stamp split at pages where page size or orientation changes ↑overview split pdf document into multiple files at pages where page size or orientation changes above the userspecified threshold this operation can either combine multiple output documents into single file based on the common page size or output separate documents for each continuous page range extract pages by text search ↑overview automatically find and extract pages that match keywords or text patterns use simple text queries or powerful regular expressions extract single pages page sets or page ranges that match your search criteria this method is used when it is necessary to extract pages that share common characteristics and group them into a single file for example reports submitted by a specific person the pages can be located anywhere in the input document and do not have to be in a continuous page range this approach is preferable when the number of output documents and text patterns is known in advance and the pages need to be grouped based on a search criteria the plugin searches page text and text content of all annotation types including annotations created with typewriter or text box tools stepbystep tutorial extacting pages with specific text split by content ↑overview automatically find and extract pages that contain specific pdf elements such as forms images links comments notes rubber stamps highlighting java script code transparency effects page rotation and many others 18 different options are available batch processing support ↑overview create your own batch sequences for processing multiple documents at once supports acrobats standard batch processing framework batch processing support is available in auto split pro™ package only three batch commands are installed by the plugin split document merge documents and extract embedded files stepbystep tutorial split pdf documents via action wizard stepbystep tutorial merge documents via action wizard launch from command line ↑overview it is also possible to launch auto split batch sequence from outside of adobe® acrobat® auto split can be started from a command line or a operating system batch file  more details  this option is available in auto split pro™ package only you can also use auto batch plugin if you need more flexibility in executing acrobat batch sequences from a command prompt page ranges from bookmarks interactively define page ranges from any bookmark in the document save settings for future reuse save and reuse complex document splitting profiles all application options can be saved into a file for future use automatically generated html index file ↑overview auto split™ plugin automatically generates an html index file that lists all output documents and links to their locations on a disk a document index is useful when splitting a large pdf file into smaller ones for faster web access put this index file on your web site along with pdf documents to provide fast and convenient access to large document collections security options password protecting output pdf documents ↑overview all documents can be optionally automatically secured with a password users will be prompted to enter a password when trying to open such documents restrict document access ↑overview security options for allowing editing printing copying to clipboard and editing text notes can be applied to output documents you can control the level of access to the document by restricting certain operations that can be performed on the files document editing and printing permissions can also be password protected output options transfer bookmarks ↑overview transfer bookmarks to output pdf documents every output document can receive an exact copy of the bookmark tree from the original document the biggest surprise is that every bookmark still points to the right locationupdate links ↑overview update links in output pdf documents to point to correct locations after splitting a document many links from source document can end up in different documents software can automatically adjust update links so they continue to point to correct location in the same or a different document the plugin adjusts page navigation actions for link annotations and form elements such as buttons insert cover pages ↑overview automatically insertappend cover pages into all output documents from other document s this option is useful when it is necessary to add a standard cover letter at the beginning of every output document or append some common pages at the end of each document fast network access ↑overview linearize output pdf documents for fast web or network access this can greatly improve document loading time if you plan to share documents on the web or local network add watermarks ↑overview add transparent watermarks to every output page available only for split by manual page ranges method transparency level can be adjusted from 0 to 100 open output documents ↑overview optionally automatically open all output files in adobe acrobat for inspection email output documents ↑overview automatically distribute output documents to designated email recipients using custom email options each output document can be optionally emailed as a file attachment to a number of email recipients including cc and bcc options documents are emailed via a default mapienabled email application that is installed on the users computer all popular email clients such as ms outlook or thunderbird do provide this functionality the ability to email files is only available in a page ranges splitting mode when a number and content of output documents is known in advance overwrite document properties ↑overview the plugin provides functionality to specify custom values for the following document properties title author subject and keywords if no custom values are specified then the software will transfer these properties from the input document the ability to specify custom properties is only available in a page ranges splitting mode when a number and content of output documents is known in advance automated document naming flexible output file naming ↑overview auto split creates unique names for output documents based on the following scheme name prefix  base file name  automatic suffix the filename can be constructed from any number of separate components such as text from location on a first page of each output pdf document text that matches a specific text pattern autoincrementing numbers and letters static text use page labels and etc output folders ↑overview the plugin allows specifying either a single output folder location for all output pdf documents or ability to determine different output folders for each document by using text from page and dynamically store output files in corresponding folders see software manual for details or contact techevermapcom for assistance name prefix ↑overview many different options are available original input file name current date document title document author document creation date number of pages in output document prefix is automatically added in front of a generated file name base file name ↑overview specify base filename all output file names will start with it this custom text will be added to the name prefix name suffixes ↑overview specify any number of name suffixes to automatically append to the filename it can be either an autoincrementing number or letter output page range page label or text from a document specified either by position on the first page of each output document or by a text search pattern auto split™ will automatically increment numbers and letters to create unique file names text from document by location ↑overview it is possible to extract text from each output document and use it as a part of the filename the plugin uses a userspecified area on the first page of each output document to retrieve text and uses it as a filename suffix text from document by text search ↑overview the software can use a search pattern utilizing a regular expression syntax to look for a specific text on the first page of each output document and use it as a filename suffix this is a very powerful method for naming output documents such as invoices account statements and reports custom file names ↑overview custom file names can be used for manual page ranges method this is because a number of output files is known in advance custom file names can be combined with a name prefix and a base filename as well create folders ↑overview auto split can create folders on a disk that mirror the bookmark tree structure of the input document this option is useful for documents with complex bookmark structures and when a better file organization is desired all output documents are instantly organized into appropriate folders bookmark names are used for naming disk folders resulting in human readable file structure this option is available only when splitting by bookmarks new post processing using acrobat java script ↑overview use the plugin to execute custom acrobat java script code on each output pdf document this feature is useful when it is necessary to perform certain modifications to the output pdf documents such as insert a common cover page add footerheader add watermarks apply security policies or save files into different folders based on userspecific logic the use of acrobat java script provides an excellent tool for customizing document splitting for your particular processing needs new post processing with commandline scripts ↑overview the plugin provides ability to execute a custom commandline script as used in bat files at the end of splitting process use this functionality to perform custom filelevel maintenance on output files such as checkin files into a corporate document management system or archive documents into a zip file document merging merge files from multiple folders into multiple pdf files ↑overview this merging operation allows creating multiple output files by merging files from multiple input folders each output file is created by taking one file from each input folder and merging them together files are merged based on filenames for each file in the first input folder there is one output file with the same name created in the output folder documents are combined by searching for the most similar file names in each input folder and appending them to the output file each file name is compared to the name of the current output file and the filename with the longest match is used  click here for the visual diagram  this method can be used to assemble multiple personalized documents for example montly statements from multiple subdocuments stepbystep tutorial merge pdf files from multiple folders based on filename similarity merge pdf documents with similar filenames ↑overview use this method to merge multiple pdf files into multiple output documents based on filename similarity each output file is created by taking one input document and finding all other documents that have at least x common first characters in the filename the similarity between two filenames is controlled by a userspecified number of characters for example use this merging method to combine documents based on first 16 characters of the filename stepbystep tutorial merge pdf files with similar filenames files are sorted alphabetically prior to merging the order of the files in the merged document s depends on the document names the names of the output documents depend on what filename appears first in the sorted list of input files here is an example of merging 8 files into 2 output pdf documents merge multiple pdf documents into one ↑overview easily merge multiple pdf documents or files in any supported file format into a single one all pages or just a selected subset of pages page range oddeven pages are copied from each input document the first page from each document is automatically bookmarked with a file name or a custom userspecified text view a screenshot of the document merging dialog file formats ↑overview any suppported file format can be used in a merge operation you can merge pdf documents various image files such as tiff and jpeg microsoft word documents and etc the actual list of supported formats depends on the particular version of adobe acrobat append pages ↑overview pages from multiple input documents are sequentially copied appended into a new output document the user can optionally specify a range of pages to use from each input document interleave pages pages from multiple input documents are sequentially interleaved and copied into a new output document software proceeds as follows first n pages from first document are copied to the output and then m pages from the second document are copied and so on this process is repeated until all pages are processed for example if document a 200 pages long is interleaved every 4 pages with document b 100 pages long interleave every 2 pages then software will repeat pages from document b as many times as necessary to complete this task the output document will look like the following pages 14 from document a pages 12 from document b pages 36 from document a pages 34 from document b pages 710 from document a  pages 196200 from document a pages 99100 from document b user can optionally specify a range of pages to use from each input document and number of pages to interleave from each document reverse page order ↑overview page order of any input document can be optionally reversed during the merge process for example after scanning 10 pages of a twosided document you may endup with two different pdf files one for odd 135 and one for even pages 1086 however the “evenpages” document has a reverse page order these two documents can be merged into a single pdf file while page order of the “evenpages” document is reversed on the fly creating output document with correct page order 123 merge oddeven pages ↑overview software allows optional selection of a page subset all pages even pages only odd pages only for each input document for example you can merge odd pages from one document with even pages from another merge all files in a folder ↑overview folders can be used as input for document merging procedures all pdf documents from a folder will be merged including content of the subfolders optionally files can be sorted alphabetically before merging blank page can be optionally added to the end of any input document that has an odd number of pages this feature ensures that the first page of each input document will start on the even page in the output document transfer bookmarks and links ↑overview the plugin transfers bookmarks from input documents and updates links to make them point to correct pages in the merged document sort input files ↑overview the merging order of input documents can be changed by alphabetically sorting file names import  export of document names ↑overview the plugin provides powerful import and export capabilities from a commadelimited text file save time by importing an existing document list from an existing spreadsheet or a database use excel or any other software of your choice to create a list of documents to merge and then easily import it into auto split optional page ranges and custom bookmark titles can be specified as well view a sample of the importexport file format save settings for future reuse save and reuse complex document merging settings to save time and increase productivity all application options including input document names can be saved into a file for future reuse merge documents using control file use plain text control file ↑overview merge one or more files pdf or any other supported file format into one or more pdf documents using a merge control file the merge control file is a plain text document that contains instructions on what document to merge combine and what options to use this method provides a flexible way of merging files into multiple pdf documents with precise user control control file is using a simple yet powerful syntax and does require programming skills insert pages into multiple documents quickly process multiple pdf files at once ↑overview insert pages from a single pdf document into multiple pdf files using a simple timesaving workflow overwrite existing files or save updated files under a different names in a selected folder create processing report listing all processed pdf files delete page ranges delete multipe pages ↑overview delete pages from pdf documents by specifying a list of individual pages andor page ranges pages can be specified either directly as absolute page numbers or indirectly via bookmarks named destinations or page labels indirect page referencing provides a very flexible way to specify page sets dynamically and especially in the batch processing stepbystep tutorial deleting page ranges automatic renaming of pdf files how it works ↑overview use this advanced feature to automatically turn nameless pdf files into humanreadable filenames according to your document processing requirements instantly rename multiple pdf files by using document text and metadata in the filenames review autogenerated names before files are actually renamed this features is a big time saverstepbystep tutorial rename pdf files by text search processing workflow ↑overview file naming components ↑overview automatically rename multiple pdf files by using any combination of the following elements original document filename text extracted from a specific location on the page text or pattern extracted by performing advanced search operation regular expression are supportedautoincremented number custom startingincrementing parameters optional leading zeroesautoincrementing letter page label from the first page of the documentany custom text document metadata property such author subject title or page count current time year month day hour minute second the name of the currently logged windows user the name of the computer updating pdf documents by inserting andor replacing pages updating multiple pdf documents ↑overview the software provides a spreadsheetlike interface for inserting andor replacing pages in one or more target pdf documents from one or more source pdf documents this operation is useful when a large set of pdf documents needs to be updated by inserting or replacing certain pages pages can be referred to by pages numbers page labels bookmarks and named destinations this provides a great flexibility in identifying pages that need to be updated all updates are applied simultaneously so there is no need to account for page number changes as a results of multiple page insertions or replacements for example it is possible to replace 2 pages starting at page label “ii” in document “apdf” with 3 pages starting at page pointed by bookmark chapter 4 in document “bpdf” automatic generation of page labels by text search ↑overview use this operation to search each page in the pdf document for the selected or custom page label style s and creating page labels if a matching text is found page labels are used by adobe acrobat in the “thumbnails” navigation panel and in the current page entry page labels allow naming pdf pages using any combination of letters and numbers the text search and matching is performed inside one or more userdefined search area on the page custom search patterns can be specified using regular expression syntax this operation is very useful for adding page labels to files for use with update documents operation delete pages by text search use “delete pages by text search” function to search pdf document for pages with userspecified text or pattern s and delete them from the document multiple search strings can be used at once stepbystep tutorial delete pages by text search find and delete duplicate pages ↑overview use this function to find and delete duplicate pages from a pdf document the plugin provides two different methods for detecting duplicate or nearduplicate pages comparing visual appearance of the pages as “images” comparing page text regardless of its visual appearance the first method provides a fast way for detecting pages that look exactly the same or have very small differences use it to find pages that are visually identical this method does not compare any invisible text that may be present on the page the second method uses a different approach it is extracting text content from each page and comparing pages as text strings with options to ignore case and punctuation if two pages contain the same sequence of words then they are considered the same regardless of the visual appearance and location on the page it is possible to use this method to find pages with similar but not identical content by specifying a maximum allowed difference between two pages in characters note that this method totally ignores any images or graphics that might appear on the page as well as text appearance properties such as font style size and color stepbystep tutorial find  delete duplicate and nearduplicate pages extracting file attachments extract all embedded files ↑overview extract all embedded files from one or more pdf documents simultaneously the plugin can process regular pdf files as well as pdf portfolios introduced in acrobat 8 all embedded content is saved into a userspecified folder the html with hyperlinks to extracted files and csv report files are generated automatically and include the following metadata file name description size in bytes creation and modification datetime md5 checksum the plugin adds extract embedded files command to the adobe acrobat batch processing framework available in adobe® acrobat® professional export embedded files metadata ↑overview the plugin allows exporting embedded files metadata for many files at once without extracting any embedded content the software supports two formats that can be easily imported into any spreadsheet application text csv and ms excel xml files metadata includes any standard or custom fields such as file name description size in bytes md5 checksum creation and modification datetime if a pdf portfolio was created by microsoft outlook convert to adobe pdf menu email application then each file might have the following metadata fields specific to email subject from to cc attachments folder received importance sensitivity and etc related software ↑overview if you are a legal professional and
