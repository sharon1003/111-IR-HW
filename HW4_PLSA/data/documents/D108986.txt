mongolian tibetan yunani chumashv t e alternative medicine or fringe medicine are practices claimed to have the healing effects of medicine but which are disproven unproven impossible to prove or are excessively harmful in relation to their effect scientific consensus states that such therapies do not or cannot work because the known laws of nature are violated by their basic claims or that the treatment is so much worse that its use is unethical alternative therapies or diagnoses are not part of medicine or sciencebased healthcare systems alternative practices products and therapies – range from plausible but not well tested to having known harmful and toxic effects large amounts of funding go to testing alternative medicine with more than us25 billion spent by the united states government alone 1 almost none show any effect beyond that of false treatment and most positive studies have been shown to be statistical flukes perceived effects of alternative medicine may be caused by placebo decreased effect of functional treatment and therefore potentially decreased side effects  and regression toward the mean where alternative therapies are credited for improvement which would have occurred anyway or any combination of the three alternative treatments are not the same as experimental medicine or traditional medicine although both can be used in a way that is alternative or fringe alternative medicine has grown in popularity and is used by a significant portion of the population in many countries the field often rebrands itself from quackery to complementary or integrative medicine – but it promotes essentially the same practices a large alternative medicine lobby exists and alternative therapies are far less regulated than conventional ones when used together with functional medical treatment alternative therapies have not been shown to complement improve the effect of or mitigate the side effects of treatment significant drug interactions caused by alternative therapies may instead negatively influence treatments making them less effective notably cancer therapy despite being illegal to market alternative therapies specifically for cancer treatment in most of the developed world many patients use them alternative medical diagnoses and treatments are not taught as part of sciencebased curricula in medical schools and are not used in any practice where treatment is based on scientific knowledge or proven experience alternative therapies are often based on religion tradition superstition belief in supernatural energies pseudoscience errors in reasoning propaganda fraud or lies regulation and licensing of alternative medicine and health care providers varies between and within countries alternative medicine is criticized for being based on misleading statements quackery pseudoscience antiscience fraud and poor scientific methodology promoting alternative medicine has been called dangerous and unethical testing alternative medicine that has no scientific basis has been called a waste of scarce research resources critics state there is really no such thing as alternative medicine just medicine that works and medicine that doesnt and the problem with the idea of alternative treatments in this sense is that they teach underlying logic which is magical childish or downright absurd 2 it has been strongly suggested that the very idea of any alternative treatment that works is paradoxical as any treatment proven to work is by definition medicine contents  hide 1 appeal11 marketing12 a failure

practitioners of complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available alternative therapies patients often express interest in mindbody complementary therapies because they offer a nondrug approach to treating some health conditions 3  clarification neededin addition to the socialcultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth one of the most critical is the placebo effect – a wellestablished observation in medicine 4 related to it are similar psychological effects such as the will to believe 5cognitive biases that help maintain selfesteem and promote harmonious social functioning 5 and the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy 5marketing  editedzard ernst a leading authority on scientific study of alternative treatments and diagnoses and the first university professor of complementary and alternative medicine here in 2012 promoting his book trick or treatment cowritten with simon singh the popularity of complementary  alternative medicine cam may be related to other factors that edzard ernst mentioned in an interview in the independent why is it so popular then ernst blames the providers customers and the doctors whose neglect he says has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped people are told lies there are 40 million websites and 399 million tell lies sometimes outrageous lies they mislead cancer patients who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives at the same time people are gullible it needs gullibility for the industry to succeed it doesnt make me popular with the public but its the truth 6paul offit proposed that alternative medicine becomes quackery in four ways by recommending against conventional therapies that are helpful promoting potentially harmful therapies without adequate warning draining patients bank accounts or by promoting magical thinking 7a failure of mainstream medicine  editfriendly and colorful images of herbal treatments may look less threatening or dangerous when compared to conventional medicine this is an intentional marketing strategy in a paper published in october 2010 entitled the publics enthusiasm for complementary and alternative medicine amounts to a critique of mainstream medicine ernst described these views in greater detail and concluded cam is popular an analysis of the reasons why this is so points towards the therapeutic relationship as a key factor providers of cam tend to build better therapeutic relationships than mainstream healthcare professionals in turn this implies that much of the popularity of cam is a poignant criticism of the failure of mainstream healthcare we should consider it seriously with a view of improving our service to patients 8social factors  editauthors have speculated on the sociocultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among the minority using them in lieu of conventional medicine there are several sociocultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of scientific literacy among the public at large and a concomitant increase in antiscientific attitudes and new age mysticism 5 related to this are vigorous marketing 9 of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics 5 10there is also an increase in conspiracy theories toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies mistrust of traditional authority figures such as the physician and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments 10 many patients lack access to contemporary medicine due to a lack of private or public health insurance which leads them to seek out lowercost alternative medicine 11 medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market 9patients can be averse to the painful unpleasant and sometimesdangerous side effects of biomedical treatments treatments for severe diseases such as cancer and hiv infection have wellknown significant sideeffects even lowrisk medications such as antibiotics can have potential to cause lifethreatening anaphylactic reactions in a very few individuals many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach in all of these cases patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments 5 10definitions and terminology  editalternative medicine  editalternative medicine is defined loosely as a set of products practices and theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the healing effects of medicine n 1 n 2 but whose effectiveness has not been clearly established using scientific methods n 1 n 3 15 16 17 18 or whose theory and practice is not part of biomedicine n 2 n 4 n 5 n 6 or whose theories or practices are directly contradicted by scientific evidence or scientific principles used in biomedicine 15 16 22 biomedicine or medicine is that part of medical science that applies principles of biology physiology molecular biology biophysics and other natural sciences to clinical practice using scientific methods to establish the effectiveness of that practice unlike medicine n 4 an alternative product or practice does not originate from using scientific methods but may instead be based on hearsay religion tradition superstition belief in supernatural energies pseudoscience errors in reasoning propaganda fraud or other unscientific sources n 3 12 15 16in general guidelines for methodologies on research and evaluation of traditional medicine published in 2000 by the world health organization who complementary and alternative medicine were defined as a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that countrys own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system 23 24the expression also refers to a diverse range of related and unrelated products practices and theories ranging from biologically plausible practices and products and practices with some evidence to practices and theories that are directly contradicted by basic science or clear evidence and products that have been conclusively proven to be ineffective or even toxic and harmful n 2 25 26the terms alternative medicine complementary medicine integrative medicine holistic medicine natural medicine unorthodox medicine fringe medicine unconventional medicine and new age medicine are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in some contexts 27 28 29 30 but may have different meanings in some rare cases marcia angell there cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative the meaning of the term alternative in the expression alternative medicine is not that it is an effective alternative to medical science although some alternative medicine promoters may use the loose terminology to give the appearance of effectiveness 15 31 loose terminology may also be used to suggest meaning that a dichotomy exists when it does not eg the use of the expressions western medicine and eastern medicine to suggest that the difference is a cultural difference between the asiatic east and the european west rather than that the difference is between evidencebased medicine and treatments that dont work 15complementary or integrative medicine  editcomplementary medicine  cm or integrative medicine  im is when alternative medicine is used together with functional medical treatment in a belief that it improves the effect of treatments n 7 12 33 34 35 however significant drug interactions caused by alternative therapies may instead negatively influence treatment making treatments less effective notably cancer therapy 36 37 both terms refer to use of alternative medical treatments alongside conventional medicine 38 39 40 an example of which is use of acupuncture sticking needles in the body to influence the flow of a supernatural energy along with using sciencebased medicine in the belief that the acupuncture increases the effectiveness or complements the sciencebased medicine 40allopathic medicine  editmain article allopathic medicine allopathic medicine or allopathy is an expression commonly used by homeopaths and proponents of other forms of alternative medicine to refer to mainstream medicine apart from in india the term is not used outside alternative medicine and not accepted by the medical field allopathy refers to the use of pharmacologically active agents or physical interventions to treat or suppress symptoms or pathophysiologic processes of diseases or conditions 41 the german version of the word allopathisch was coined in 1810 by the creator of homeopathy samuel hahnemann 1755–1843 42 the word was coined from allo different and pathic relating to a disease or to a method of treatment 43 in alternative medicine circles the expression allopathic medicine is still used to refer to the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called western medicine biomedicine evidencebased medicine or modern medicine see the article on scientific medicine  44use of the term remains common among homeopaths and has spread to other alternative medicine practices the meaning implied by the label has never been accepted by conventional medicine and is considered pejorative 45 more recently some sources have used the term allopathic particularly american sources wishing to distinguish between doctors of medicine md and doctors of osteopathic medicine do in the united states 42 46 william jarvis an expert on alternative medicine and public health 47 states that although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale eg using a laxative to relieve constipation standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle and that the label allopath was from the start considered highly derisive by regular medicine 48many conventional medical treatments clearly do not fit the nominal definition of allopathy as they seek to prevent illness or remove its cause 49 50cam  editcam is an abbreviation of complementary and alternative medicine 51 52 it has also been called s cam or scam with the addition of socalled or supplements 53 54 the words balance and holism are often used claiming to take into account a whole person in contrast to the supposed reductionism of medicine due to its many names the field has been criticized for intense rebranding of what are essentially the same practices as soon as one name is declared synonymous with quackery a new name is chosen 27traditional medicine  editmain article traditional medicine traditional medicine refers to the prescientific practices of a certain culture contrary to what is typically practiced in other cultures where medical science dominates eastern medicine  typically refers to the traditional medicines of asia where conventional biomedicine penetrated much later problems with definition  editprominent members of the science 7 55 and biomedical science community 14 say that it is not meaningful to define an alternative medicine that is separate from a conventional medicine that the expressions conventional medicine alternative medicine complementary medicine integrative medicine and holistic medicine do not refer to any medicine at all 7 14 55 56others in both the biomedical and cam communities say that cam cannot be precisely defined because of the diversity of theories and practices it includes and because the boundaries between cam and biomedicine overlap are porous and change 19 57 the expression complementary and alternative medicine cam resists easy definition because the health systems and practices it refers to are diffuse and its boundaries poorly defined 25 58 n 8 healthcare practices categorized as alternative may differ in their historical origin theoretical basis diagnostic technique therapeutic practice and in their relationship to the medical mainstream 60 some alternative therapies including traditional chinese medicine tcm and ayurveda have antique origins in east or south asia and are entirely alternative medical systems 61 others such as homeopathy and chiropractic have origins in europe or the united states and emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 62 some such as osteopathy and chiropractic employ manipulative physical methods of treatment others such as meditation and prayer are based on mindbody interventions 63 treatments considered alternative in one location may be considered conventional in another 64 thus chiropractic is not considered alternative in denmark and likewise osteopathic medicine is no longer thought of as an alternative therapy in the united states 64critics say the expression is deceptive because it implies there is an effective alternative to sciencebased medicine and that complementary is deceptive because it implies that the treatment increases the effectiveness of complements sciencebased medicine while alternative medicines that have been tested nearly always have no measurable positive effect compared to a placebo 15 65 66 67different types of definitions  editone common feature of all definitions of alternative medicine is its designation as other than conventional medicine 68 for example the widely referenced 69 descriptive definition of complementary and alternative medicine devised by the us national center for complementary and integrative health nccih of the national institutes of health nih states that it is a group of diverse medical and health care systems practices and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine 70 for conventional medical practitioners it does not necessarily follow that either it or its practitioners would no longer be considered alternative n 9some definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare 73 this can refer to the lack of support that alternative therapies receive from the medical establishment and related bodies regarding access to research funding sympathetic coverage in the medical press or inclusion in the standard medical curriculum 73 in 1993 the british medical association bma one among many professional organizations who have attempted to define alternative medicine stated that it n 10 referred to those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the conventional healthcare professions and the skills of which are not taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of conventional medical and paramedical healthcare courses 74 in a us context an influential definition coined in 1993 by the harvardbased physician 75 david m eisenberg 76 characterized alternative medicine as interventions neither taught widely in medical schools nor generally available in us hospitals 77 these descriptive definitions are inadequate in the presentday when some conventional doctors offer alternative medical treatments and cam introductory courses or modules can be offered as part of standard undergraduate medical training 78 alternative medicine is taught in more than 50 per cent of us medical schools and increasingly us health insurers are willing to provide reimbursement for cam therapies 79 in 1999 77 of us hospitals reported using some form of cam therapy this proportion had risen to 377 by 2008 80an expert panel at a conference hosted in 1995 by the us office for alternative medicine oam 81 n 11 devised a theoretical definition 81 of alternative medicine as a broad domain of healing resources  other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period 83 this definition has been widely adopted by cam researchers 81 cited by official government bodies such as the uk department of health 84 attributed as the definition used by the cochrane collaboration 85 and with some modification  dubious – discuss was preferred in the 2005 consensus report of the us institute of medicine complementary and alternative medicine in the united states n 2the 1995 oam conference definition an expansion of eisenbergs 1993 formulation is silent regarding questions of the medical effectiveness of alternative therapies 86 its proponents hold that it thus avoids relativism about differing forms of medical knowledge and while it is an essentially political definition this should not imply that the dominance of mainstream biomedicine is solely due to political forces 86 according to this definition alternative and mainstream medicine can only be differentiated with reference to what is intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society of culture 87 however there is neither a reliable method to distinguish between cultures and subcultures nor to attribute them as dominant or subordinate nor any accepted criteria to determine the dominance of a cultural entity 87 if the culture of a politically dominant healthcare system is held to be equivalent to the perspectives of those charged with the medical management of leading healthcare institutions and programs the definition fails to recognize the potential for division either within such an elite or between a healthcare elite and the wider population 87normative definitions distinguish alternative medicine from the biomedical mainstream in its provision of therapies that are unproven unvalidated or ineffective and support of theories with no recognized scientific basis 88 these definitions characterize practices as constituting alternative medicine when used independently or in place of evidencebased medicine they are put forward as having the healing effects of medicine but are not based on evidence gathered with the scientific method 12 14 38 39 70 89 exemplifying this perspective a 1998 editorial coauthored by marcia angell a former editor of the new england journal of medicine argued that it is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride there cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative there is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work once a treatment has been tested rigorously it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset if it is found to be reasonably safe and effective it will be accepted but assertions speculation and testimonials do not substitute for evidence alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments 14this line of division has been subject to criticism however as not all forms of standard medical practice have adequately demonstrated evidence of benefit n 4 90 91 and it is also unlikely in most instances that conventional therapies if proven to be ineffective would ever be classified as cam 81similarly the public information website maintained by the national health and medical research council nhmrc of the commonwealth of australia uses the acronym cam for a wide range of health care practices therapies procedures and devices not within the domain of conventional medicine in the australian context this is stated to include acupuncture aromatherapy chiropractic homeopathy massage meditation and relaxation therapies naturopathy osteopathy reflexology traditional chinese medicine and the use of vitamin supplements 92the danish national board of healths council for alternative medicine sundhedsstyrelsens råd for alternativ behandling srab an independent institution under the national board of health danish sundhedsstyrelsen  uses the term alternative medicine for treatments performed by therapists that are not authorized healthcare professionals treatments performed by authorized healthcare professionals but those based on methods otherwise used mainly outside the healthcare system people without a healthcare authorisation are also allowed to perform the treatments 93proponents of an evidencebase for medicine n 12 95 96 97 98 such as the cochrane collaboration founded in 1993 and from 2011 providing input for who resolutions take a position that all systematic reviews of treatments whether mainstream or alternative ought to be held to the current standards of scientific method 99 in a study titled development and classification of an operational definition of complementary and alternative medicine for the cochrane collaboration 2011 it was proposed that indicators that a therapy is accepted include government licensing of practitioners coverage by health insurance statements of approval by government agencies and recommendation as part of a practice guideline and that if something is currently a standard accepted therapy then it is not likely to be widely considered as cam 81nccih classification  edita united states government agency the national center on complementary and integrative health  nccih  created its own classification system for

alternative medicine may refer to the history of a group of diverse medical practices that were collectively promoted as alternative medicine beginning in the 1970s to the collection of individual histories of members of that group or to the history of western medical practices that were labeled irregular practices by the western medical establishment 15 128 129 130 131 it includes the histories of complementary medicine and of integrative medicine before the 1970s western practitioners that were not part of the increasingly sciencebased medical establishment were referred to irregular practitioners and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific and as practicing quackery 128 129 until the 1970s irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as quackery and fraud as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments 130 in the 1970s irregular practices were grouped with traditional practices of nonwestern cultures and with other unproven or disproven practices that were not part of biomedicine with the entire group collectively marketed and promoted under the single expression alternative medicine 15 128 129 130 132use of alternative medicine in the west began to rise following the counterculture movement of the 1960s as part of the rising new age movement of the 1970s 15 133 134 this was due to misleading mass marketing of alternative medicine being an effective alternative to biomedicine changing social attitudes about not using chemicals and challenging the establishment and authority of any kind sensitivity to giving equal measure to beliefs and practices of other cultures  cultural relativism  and growing frustration and desperation by patients about limitations and side effects of sciencebased medicine 15 129 130 131 132 134 135 at the same time in 1975 the american medical association which played the central role in fighting quackery in the united states abolished its quackery committee and closed down its department of investigation 128 xxi 135 by the early to mid 1970s the expression alternative medicine came into widespread use and the expression became mass marketed as a collection of natural and effective treatment alternatives to sciencebased biomedicine 15 135 136 137 by 1983 mass marketing of alternative medicine was so pervasive that the british medical journal bmj pointed to an apparently endless stream of books articles and radio and television programmes urge on the public the virtues of alternative medicine treatments ranging from meditation to drilling a hole in the skull to let in more oxygen 135 in this 1983 article the bmj wrote one of the few growth industries in contemporary britain is alternative medicine noting that by 1983 33 of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 39 of those with backache admitted to having consulted an alternative practitioner 135by about 1990 the usa alternative medicine industry had grown to a us27 billion per year with polls showing 30 of americans were using it 134 138 moreover polls showed that americans made more visits for alternative therapies than the total number of visits to primary care doctors and american outofpocket spending noninsurance spending on alternative medicine was about equal to spending on biomedical doctors 128 172 in 1991 time magazine ran a cover story the new age of alternative medicine why new age medicine is catching on 134 138 in 1993 the new england journal of medicine reported one in three americans as using alternative medicine 134 in 1993 the public broadcasting system ran a bill moyers special healing and the mind with moyers commenting that people by the tens of millions are using alternative medicine if established medicine does not understand that they are going to lose their clients 134another explosive growth began in the 1990s when senior level political figures began promoting alternative medicine investing large sums of government medical research funds into testing alternative medicine including testing of scientifically implausible treatments and relaxing government regulation of alternative medicine products as compared to biomedical products 15 128 xxi 129 130 131 132 139 140 beginning with a 1991 appropriation of us2 million for funding research of alternative medicine research federal spending grew to a cumulative total of about us25 billion by 2009 with 50 of americans using alternative medicine by 2013 141 142in 1993 britains prince charles who claimed that homeopathy and other alternative medicine was an effective alternative to biomedicine established the princes foundation for integrated health fih as a charity to explore how safe proven complementary therapies can work in conjunction with mainstream medicine 143 the fih received government funding through grants from britains department of health 143 in 2008 londons the times published a letter from edzard ernst that asked the fih to recall two guides promoting alternative medicine saying the majority of alternative therapies appear to be clinically ineffective and many are downright dangerous in 2010 the fih closed after allegations of fraud and money laundering led to arrests of its officials 143in 2001 medline introduced a me sh term to index scientific publications in alternative medicine 144 145in 2004 modifications of the european parliament s 2001 directive 200183ec regulating all medicine products were made with the expectation of influencing development of the european market for alternative medicine products 146 regulation of alternative medicine in europe was loosened with a simplified registration procedure for traditional herbal medicinal products 146 147 plausible efficacy for traditional medicine was redefined to be based on long term popularity and testimonials the pharmacological effects or efficacy of the medicinal product are plausible on the basis of longstanding use and experience  without scientific testing 146 147 the committee on herbal medicinal products hmpc was created within the european medicines agency in london emea a special working group was established for homeopathic remedies under the heads of medicines agencies 146through 2004 alternative medicine that was traditional to germany continued to be a regular part of the health care system including homeopathy and anthroposophic medicine 146 the german medicines act mandated that sciencebased medical authorities consider the particular characteristics of complementary and alternative medicines 146 by 2004 homeopathy had grown to be the most used alternative therapy in france growing from 16 of the population using homeopathic medicine in 1982 to 29 by 1987 36 percent by 1992 and 62 of french mothers using homeopathic medicines by 2004 with 95 of french pharmacists advising pregnant women to use homeopathic remedies 148 as of 2004 100 million people in india depended solely on traditional german homeopathic remedies for their medical care 149 as of 2010 homeopathic remedies continued to be the leading alternative treatment used by european physicians 148 by 2005 sales of homeopathic remedies and anthroposophical medicine had grown to €930 million a 60 increase from 1995 148 150since 2009 according to art 118a of the swiss federal constitution the swiss confederation and the cantons of switzerland shall within the scope of their powers ensure that consideration is given to complementary medicine 151by 2013 50 of americans were using cam 142 as of 2013 cam medicinal products in europe continued to be exempted from documented efficacy standards required of other medicinal products 152individual systems and practices  editmuch of what is now categorized as alternative medicine was developed as independent complete medical systems these were developed long before biomedicine and use of scientific methods each system was developed in relatively isolated regions of the world where there was little or no medical contact with prescientific western medicine or with each others systems examples are traditional chinese medicine and the ayurvedic medicine of india other alternative medicine practices such as homeopathy were developed in western europe and in opposition to western medicine at a time when western medicine was based on unscientific theories that were dogmatically imposed by western religious authorities homeopathy was developed prior to discovery of the basic principles of chemistry which proved homeopathic remedies contained nothing but water but homeopathy with its remedies made of water was harmless compared to the unscientific and dangerous orthodox western medicine practiced at that time which included use of toxins and draining of blood often resulting in permanent disfigurement or death 129other alternative practices such as chiropractic and osteopathic manipulative medicine were developed in the united states at a time that western medicine was beginning to incorporate scientific methods and theories but the biomedical model was not yet totally dominant practices such as chiropractic and osteopathy each considered to be irregular practices by the western medical establishment also opposed each other both rhetorically and politically with licensing legislation osteopathic practitioners added the courses and training of biomedicine to their licensing and licensed doctor of osteopathic medicine holders began diminishing use of the unscientific origins of the field irregular practitioners  editmain article history of alternative medicine further information history of medicine until the 1970s western practitioners that were not part of the medical establishment were referred to irregular practitioners and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific as practicing quackery 129 the irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as quackery and fraud as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments dating from the 1970s medical professionals sociologists anthropologists and other commentators noted the increasing visibility of a wide variety of health practices that had neither derived directly from nor been verified by biomedical science 153 since that time those who have analyzed this trend have deliberated over the most apt language with which to describe this emergent health field 153 a variety of terms have been used including heterodox irregular fringe and alternative medicine while others particularly medical commentators have been satisfied to label them as instances of quackery 153 the most persistent term has been alternative medicine but its use is problematic as it assumes a valueladen dichotomy between a medical fringe implicitly of borderline acceptability at best and a privileged medical orthodoxy associated with validated medicoscientific norms 154 the use of the category of alternative medicine has also been criticized as it cannot be studied as an independent entity but must be understood in terms of a regionally and temporally specific medical orthodoxy 155 its use can also be misleading as it may erroneously imply that a real medical alternative exists 156 as with nearsynonymous expressions such as unorthodox complementary marginal or quackery these linguistic devices have served in the context of processes of professionalisation and market competition to establish the authority of official medicine and police the boundary between it and its unconventional rivals 154peking union medical college an early instance of the influence of this modern or western scientific medicine outside europe and north america is peking union medical college 157 n 14 n 15from a historical perspective the emergence of alternative medicine if not the term itself is typically dated to the 19th century 158 this is despite the fact that there are variants of western nonconventional medicine that arose in the lateeighteenth century or earlier and some nonwestern medical traditions currently considered alternative in the west and elsewhere which boast extended historical pedigrees 154 alternative medical systems however can only be said to exist when there is an identifiable regularized and authoritative standard medical practice such as arose in the west during the nineteenth century to which they can function as an alternative 159during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries regular and irregular medical practitioners became more clearly differentiated throughout much of europe and 160 as the nineteenth century progressed most western states converged in the creation of legally delimited and semiprotected medical markets 161 it is at this point that an official medicine created in cooperation with the state and employing a scientific rhetoric of legitimacy emerges as a recognizable entity and that the concept of alternative medicine as a historical category becomes tenable 162as part of this process professional adherents of mainstream medicine in countries such as germany france and britain increasingly invoked the scientific basis of their discipline as a means of engendering internal professional unity and of external differentiation in the face of sustained market competition from homeopaths naturopaths mesmerists and other nonconventional medical practitioners finally achieving a degree of imperfect dominance through alliance with the state and the passage of regulatory legislation 154 156 in the us the johns hopkins university school of medicine based in baltimore maryland opened in 1893 with william h welch and william osler among the founding physicians and was the first medical school devoted to teaching german scientific medicine 163buttressed by increased authority arising from significant advances in the medical sciences of the late 19th century onwards – including development and application of the germ theory of disease by the chemist louis pasteur and the surgeon joseph lister of microbiology cofounded by robert koch in 1885 appointed professor of hygiene at the university of berlin  and of the use of xrays  röntgen rays —the 1910 flexner report called upon american medical schools to follow the model of the johns hopkins school of medicine and adhere to mainstream science in their teaching and research this was in a belief mentioned in the reports introduction that the preliminary and professional training then prevailing in medical schools should be reformed in view of the new means for diagnosing and combating disease made available by the sciences on which medicine depended n 16 165putative medical practices at the time that later became known as alternative medicine included homeopathy founded in germany in the early 19th century and chiropractic founded in north america in the late 19th century these conflicted in principle with the developments in medical science upon which the flexner reforms were based and they have not become compatible with further advances of medical science such as listed in timeline of medicine and medical technology 1900–1999 and 2000–present nor have ayurveda acupuncture or other kinds of alternative medicine  citation neededat the same time  tropical medicine  was being developed as a specialist branch of western medicine in research establishments such as liverpool school of tropical medicine founded in 1898 by alfred lewis jones london school of hygiene  tropical medicine founded in 1899 by patrick manson and tulane university school of public health and tropical medicine instituted in 1912 a distinction was being made between western scientific medicine and indigenous systems an example is given by an official report about indigenous systems of medicine in india including ayurveda submitted by mohammad usman of madras and others in 1923 this stated that the first question the committee considered was to decide whether the indigenous systems of medicine were scientific or not 166 167 168by the later twentieth century the term alternative medicine entered public discourse n 17 170 but it was not always being used with the same meaning by all parties arnold s relman remarked in 1998 that in the best kind of medical practice all proposed treatments must be tested objectively and that in the end there will only be treatments that pass and those that do not those that are proven worthwhile and those that are not he asked can there be any reasonable alternative 171 but also in 1998 the then surgeon general of the united states david satcher 172 issued public information about eight common alternative treatments including acupuncture holistic and massage together with information about common diseases and conditions on nutrition diet and lifestyle changes and about helping consumers to decipher fraud and quackery and to find healthcare centers and doctors who practiced alternative medicine 173by 1990 approximately 60 million americans had used one or more complementary or alternative therapies to address health issues according to a nationwide survey in the us published in 1993 by david eisenberg 174 a study published in the november 11 1998 issue of the journal of the american medical association reported that 42 of americans had used complementary and alternative therapies up from 34 in 1990 175 however despite the growth in patient demand for complementary medicine most of the early alternativecomplementary medical centers failed 176medical education  editmainly as a result of reforms following the flexner report of 1910 177 medical education in established medical schools in the us has generally not included alternative medicine as a teaching topic n 18 typically their teaching is based on current practice and scientific knowledge about anatomy physiology histology embryology neuroanatomy pathology pharmacology microbiology and immunology 179 medical schools teaching includes such topics as doctorpatient communication ethics the art of medicine 180 and engaging in complex clinical reasoning medical decisionmaking 181 writing in 2002 snyderman and weil remarked that by the early twentieth century the flexner model had helped to create the 20thcentury academic health center in which education research and practice were inseparable while this had much improved medical practice by defining with increasing certainty the pathophysiological basis of disease a singleminded focus on the pathophysiological had diverted much of mainstream american medicine from clinical conditions that were not well understood in mechanistic terms and were not effectively treated by conventional therapies 182by 2001 some form of cam training was being offered by at least 75 out of 125 medical schools in the us 183 exceptionally the school of medicine of the university of maryland baltimore includes a research institute for integrative medicine a member entity of the cochrane collaboration 99 184 medical schools are responsible for conferring medical degrees but a physician typically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local government authority licensed physicians in the us who have attended one of the established medical schools there have usually graduated doctor of medicine md 185 all states require that applicants for md licensure be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the united states medical licensing exam usmle 185the british medical association in its publication complementary medicine new approach to good practice 1993 gave as a working definition of nonconventional therapies including acupuncture chiropractic and homeopathy those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the orthodox healthcare professions and the skills of which are not part of the undergraduate curriculum of orthodox medical and paramedical healthcare courses 186 by 2000 some medical schools in the uk were offering cam familiarisation courses to undergraduate medical students while some were also offering modules specifically on cam 187united states government  editmain article national center for complementary and integrative health sen tom harkin at a press conference in 1991 pointing to a need for testing because of the widespread use of alternative medicine without authoritative information on its efficacy united states senator tom harkin used us2 million of his discretionary funds to create the office for the study of unconventional medical practices osump later renamed to be the office of alternative medicine oam 128 170 188 189 the oam was created to be within the national institute of health nih the scientifically prestigious primary agency of the united states government responsible for biomedical and healthrelated research 128 170 188 189 the mandate was to investigate evaluate and validate effective alternative medicine treatments and alert the public as the results of testing its efficacy 138 188 189 190sen harkin had become convinced his allergies were cured by taking bee pollen pills and was urged to make the spending by two of his influential constituents 138 188 189 bedell a longtime friend of sen harkin was a former member of the united states house of representatives who believed that alternative medicine had twice cured him of diseases after mainstream medicine had failed claiming that cows milk colostrum cured his lyme disease and an herbal derivative from camphor had prevented post surgical recurrence of his prostate cancer 128 138 wiewel was a promoter of unproven cancer treatments involving a mixture of blood sera that the food and drug administration had banned from being imported 138 both bedell and wiewel became members of the advisory panel for the oam the company that sold the bee pollen was later fined by the federal trade commission for making false health claims about their beepollen products reversing the aging process curing allergies and helping with weight loss 191in 1994 sen harkin d and senator orrin hatch r introduced the dietary supplement health and education act  dshea  192 193 the act reduced authority of the fda to monitor products sold as natural treatments 192 labeling standards were reduced to allow health claims for supplements based only on unconfirmed preliminary studies that were not subjected to scientific peer review and the act made it more difficult for the fda to promptly seize products or demand proof of safety where there was evidence of a product being dangerous 193 the act became known as  the 1993 snake oil protection act  following a new york times editorial under that name 192senator harkin complained about the unbendable rules of randomized clinical trials  citing his use of bee pollen to treat his allergies which he claimed to be effective even though it was biologically implausible and efficacy was not established using scientific methods 188 194 sen harkin asserted that claims for alternative medicine efficacy be allowed not only without conventional scientific testing even when they are biologically implausible it is not necessary for the scientific community to understand the process before the american public can benefit from these therapies 192 following passage of the act sales rose from about us4 billion in 1994 to us20 billion by the end of 2000 at the same time as evidence of their lack of efficacy or harmful effects grew 192 senator harkin came into open public conflict with the first oam director joseph m jacobs and oam board members from the scientific and biomedical community 189 jacobs insistence on rigorous scientific methodology caused friction with senator harkin 188 194 195 increasing political resistance to the use of scientific methodology was publicly criticized by jacobs and another oam board member complained that nonsense has trickled down to every aspect of this office its the only place where opinions are counted as equal to data 188 194 in 1994 senator harkin appeared on television with cancer patients who blamed jacobs for blocking their access to untested cancer treatment leading jacobs to resign in frustration 188 194in 1995 wayne jonas a promoter of homeopathy and political ally of senator harkin became the director of the oam and continued in that role until 1999 196 in 1997 the nccam budget was increased from us12 million to us20 million annually 197 from 1990 to 1997 use of alternative medicine in the us increased by 25 with a corresponding 50 increase in expenditures 175 the oam drew increasing criticism from eminent members of the scientific community with letters to the senate appropriations committee when discussion of renewal of funding oam came up 128 175 nobel laureate paul berg wrote that prestigious nih should not be degraded to act as a cover for quackery calling the oam an embarrassment to serious scientists 128 175 197 the president of the american physical society wrote complaining that the government was spending money on testing products and practices that violate basic laws of physics and more clearly resemble witchcraft 128 175 197 in 1998 the president of the north carolina medical association publicly called for shutting down the oam 198in 1998 nih director and nobel laureate harold varmus came into conflict with senator harkin by pushing to have more nih control of alternative medicine research 199 the nih director placed the oam under more strict scientific nih control 197 199 senator harkin responded by elevating oam into an independent nih center just short of being its own institute and renamed to be the national center for complementary and alternative medicine nccam nccam had a mandate to promote a more rigorous and scientific approach to the study of alternative medicine research training and career development outreach and integration in 1999 the nccam budget was increased from us20 million to us50 million 198 199 the united states congress approved the appropriations without dissent in 2000 the budget was increased to about us68 million in 2001 to us90 million in 2002 to us104 million and in 2003 to us113 million 198in 2009 after a history of 17 years of government testing and spending of nearly us25 billion on research had produced almost no clearly proven efficacy of alternative therapies senator harkin complained one of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches quite frankly i must say publicly that it has fallen short it think quite frankly that in this center and in the office previously before it most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving 199 200 201 members of the scientific community criticized this comment as showing senator harkin did not understand the basics of scientific inquiry which tests hypotheses but never intentionally attempts to validate approaches 199 members of the scientific and biomedical communities complained that after a history of 17 years of being tested at a cost of over us25 billion on testing scientifically and biologically implausible practices almost no alternative therapy showed clear efficacy 141 in 2009 the nccams budget was increased to about us122 million 199 overall nih funding for cam research increased to us300 million by 2009 199 by 2009 in the usa us34 billion was spent annually on cam 202in 2012 the journal of the american medical association jama published a criticism that study after study had been funded by nccam but failed to prove that complementary or alternative therapies are anything more than placebos 203 the jama criticism pointed to large wasting of research money on testing scientifically implausible treatments citing nccam officials spending us374000 to find that inhaling lemon and lavender scents does not promote wound healing us750000 to find that prayer does not cure aids or hasten recovery from breastreconstruction surgery us390000 to find that ancient indian remedies do not control type 2 diabetes us700000 to find that magnets do not treat arthritis carpal tunnel syndrome or migraine headaches and us406000 to find that coffee enemas do not cure pancreatic cancer 203 it was pointed out that negative results from testing were generally ignored by the public that people continue to believe what they want to believe arguing that it does not matter what the data show they know what works for them 203 continued increasing use of cam products was also blamed on the lack of fda ability to regulate alternative products where negative studies do not result in fda warnings or fdamandated changes on labeling whereby few consumers are aware that many claims of many supplements were found not to have not to be supported 203in 2014 the nccam was renamed to the national center for complementary and integrative health nccih with a new charter requiring that 12 of the 18 council members shall be selected with a preference to selecting leading representatives of complementary and alternative medicine 9 of the members must be licensed practitioners of alternative medicine six members must be general public leaders in the fields of public policy law health policy economics and management and 3 members must represent the interests of individual consumers of complementary and alternative medicine 204efficacy  editthere is a general scientific consensus that alternative therapies lack the requisite scientific validation and their effectiveness is either unproved or disproved 12 15 205 206 many of the claims regarding the efficacy of alternative medicines are controversial since research on them is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed 207selective publication bias marked differences in product quality and standardisation and some companies making unsubstantiated claims call into question the claims of efficacy of isolated examples where there is evidence for alternative therapies 208the scientific review of alternative medicine points to confusions in the general population – a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwiseineffective therapy just because they are taking something the placebo effect the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness the regression fallacy gets misattributed to an alternative medicine being taken a person not diagnosed with sciencebased medicine may never originally have had a true illness diagnosed as an alternative disease category 209edzard ernst characterized the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak nonexistent or negative 210 and in 2011 published his estimate that about 74 were based on sound evidence although he believes that may be an overestimate 211 ernst has concluded that 95 of the alternative treatments he and his team studied including acupuncture herbal medicine homeopathy and reflexology are statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments but he also believes there is something that conventional doctors can usefully learn from the chiropractors and homeopath this is the therapeutic value of the placebo effect one of the strangest phenomena in medicine 212 213in 2003 a project funded by the cdc identified 208 conditiontreatment pairs of which 58 had been studied by at least one randomized controlled trial rct and 23 had been assessed with a metaanalysis 214 according to a 2005 book by a us institute of medicine panel the number of rcts focused on cam has risen dramatically as of 2005 the cochrane library had 145 camrelated cochrane systematic reviews and 340 noncochrane systematic reviews an analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 cochrane reviews was done by two readers in 83 of the cases the readers agreed in the 17 in which they disagreed a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating these studies found that for cam 384 concluded positive effect or possibly positive 124 48 concluded no effect 07 concluded harmful effect and 566 concluded insufficient evidence an assessment of conventional treatments found that 413 concluded positive or possibly positive effect 20 concluded no effect 81 concluded net harmful effects and 213 concluded insufficient evidence however the cam review used the more developed 2004 cochrane database while the conventional review used the initial 1998 cochrane database 215in the same way as for conventional therapies drugs and interventions it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in clinical trials in instances where an established effective treatment for a condition is already available the helsinki declaration states that withholding such treatment is unethical in most circumstances use of standardofcare treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficulttointerpret results 216cancer researcher andrew j vickers has stated contrary to much popular and scientific writing many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in goodquality clinical trials and they have been shown to be ineffective the label unproven is inappropriate for such therapies it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been disproven 217criticism legitimacy and effects  edit“ there is no alternative medicine there is only scientifically proven evidencebased medicine supported by solid data or unproven medicine for which scientific evidence is lacking ”— p b fontanarosa journal of the american medical association 1998 56cam meaning complementary and alternative medicine is not as well researched as conventional medicine which undergoes intense research before release to the public 218 funding for research is also sparse making it difficult to do further research for effectiveness of cam 219 most funding for cam is funded by government agencies 218 proposed research for cam are rejected by most private funding agencies because the results of research are not reliable 218 the research for cam has to meet certain standards from research ethics committees which most cam researchers find almost impossible to meet 218 even with the little research done on it cam has not been proven to be effective 220steven novella a neurologist at yale school of medicine wrote that government funded studies of integrating alternative medicine techniques into the mainstream are used to lend an appearance of legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate 221 marcia angell considered that critics felt that healthcare practices should be classified based solely on scientific evidence and if a treatment had been rigorously tested and found safe and effective sciencebased medicine will adopt it regardless of whether it was considered alternative to begin with 14 it is possible for a method to change categories proven vs unproven based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof a prominent supporter of this position is george d lundberg former editor of the journal of the american medical association jama 56writing in 1999 in ca a cancer journal for clinicians barrie r cassileth mentioned a 1997 letter to the us senate subcommittee on public health and safety which had deplored the lack of critical thinking and scientific rigor in oamsupported research had been signed by four nobel laureates and other prominent scientists this was supported by the national institutes of health nih 222in march 2009 a staff writer for the washington post reported that the impending national discussion about broadening access to health care improving medical practice and saving money was giving a group of scientists an opening to propose shutting down the national center for complementary and alternative medicine they quoted one of these scientists steven salzberg a genome researcher and computational biologist at the university of maryland as saying one of our concerns is that nih is funding pseudoscience they noted that the vast majority of studies were based on fundamental misunderstandings of physiology and disease and had shown little or no effect 221writers such as carl sagan a noted astrophysicist advocate of scientific skepticism and the author of the demonhaunted world science as a candle in the dark 1996 have lambasted the lack of empirical evidence to support the existence of the putative energy fields on which these therapies are predicated 123sampson has also pointed out that cam tolerated contradiction without thorough reason and experiment 223 barrett has pointed out that there is a policy at the nih of never saying something doesnt work only that a different version or dose might give different results 141 barrett also expressed concern that just because some alternatives have merit there is the impression that the rest deserve equal consideration and respect even though most are worthless since they are all classified under the one heading of alternative medicine 224some critics of alternative medicine are focused upon health fraud misinformation and quackery as public health problems notably wallace sampson and paul kurtz founders of scientific review of alternative medicine and stephen barrett cofounder of the national council against health fraud and webmaster of quackwatch 225 grounds for opposing alternative medicine include that it is usually based on religion tradition superstition belief in supernatural energies pseudoscience errors in reasoning propaganda or fraud 10 12 15 226alternative therapies typically lack any scientific validation and their effectiveness is either unproved or disproved 15 205 206  dubious – discusstreatments are not part of the conventional sciencebased healthcare system 23 70 227 228research on alternative medicine is

ignorance or misunderstanding of scientific principles errors in reasoning or newly conceived approaches claiming to heal 10 15 231many alternative medical treatments are not patentable  citation needed which may lead to less research funding from the private sector in addition in most countries alternative treatments in contrast to pharmaceuticals can be marketed without any proof of efficacy – also a disincentive for manufacturers to fund scientific research 232english evolutionary biologist richard dawkins in his 2003 book a devils chaplain defined alternative medicine as a set of practices that cannot be tested refuse to be tested or consistently fail tests 233 dawkins argued that if a technique is demonstrated effective in properly performed trials then it ceases to be alternative and simply becomes medicine 234cam is also often less regulated than conventional medicine 218 there are ethical concerns about whether people who perform cam have the proper knowledge to treat patients 218 cam is often done by nonphysicians who do not operate with the same medical licensing laws which govern conventional medicine 218 and it is often described as an issue of nonmaleficence 235according to two writers wallace sampson and k butler marketing is part of the training required in alternative medicine and propaganda methods in alternative medicine have been traced back to those used by hitler and goebels in their promotion of pseudoscience in medicine 15 236in november 2011 edzard ernst stated that the level of misinformation about alternative medicine has now reached the point where it has become dangerous and unethical so far alternative medicine has remained an ethicsfree zone it is time to change this 237placebo effect  edita research methods expert and author of snake oil science r barker bausell has stated that its become politically correct to investigate nonsense 141 there are concerns that just having nih support is being used to give unfounded legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate 221use of placebos to achieve a placebo effect in integrative medicine has been criticized as diverting research time money and other resources from more fruitful lines of investigation in order to pursue a theory that has no basis in biology 66 67another critic has argued that academic proponents of integrative medicine sometimes recommend misleading patients by using known placebo treatments to achieve a placebo effect n 19 however a 2010 survey of family physicians found that 56 of respondents said they had used a placebo in clinical practice as well eightyfive percent of respondents believed placebos can have both psychological and physical benefits 239integrative medicine has been criticized in that its practitioners trained in sciencebased medicine deliberately mislead patients by pretending placebos are not  quackademic medicine  is a pejorative term used for integrative medicine which medical professionals consider an infiltration of quackery into academic sciencebased medicine 67an analysis of trends in the criticism of complementary and alternative medicine cam in five prestigious american medical journals during the period of reorganization within medicine 1965–1999 was reported as showing that the medical profession had responded to the growth of cam in three phases and that in each phase changes in the medical marketplace had influenced the type of response in the journals 240 changes included relaxed medical licensing the development of managed care rising consumerism and the establishment of the usa office of alternative medicine later national center for complementary and alternative medicine currently national center for complementary and integrative health  n 20 in the condemnation phase from the late 1960s to the early 1970s authors had ridiculed exaggerated the risks and petitioned the state to contain cam in the reassessment phase mid1970s through early 1990s when increased consumer utilization of cam was prompting concern authors had pondered whether patient dissatisfaction and shortcomings in conventional care contributed to the trend in the integration phase of the 1990s physicians began learning to work around or administer cam and the subjugation of cam to scientific scrutiny had become the primary means of control use and regulation  editprevalence of use  editcomplementary and alternative medicine cam has been described as a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems modalities and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period cam includes all such practices and ideas selfdefined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and wellbeing boundaries within cam and between the cam domain and that of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed 81  dubious – discussaccording to recent research the increasing popularity of the cam needs to be explained by moral convictions or lifestyle choices rather than by economic reasoning 242about 50 of people in developed countries use some kind of complementary and alternative medicine other than prayer for health 11 243 244 a british telephone survey by the bbc of 1209 adults in 1998 shows that around 20 of adults in britain had used alternative medicine in the past 12 months 245 about 40 of cancer patients use some form of cam 246in developing nations access to essential medicines is severely restricted by lack of resources and poverty traditional remedies often closely resembling or forming the basis for alternative remedies may comprise primary healthcare or be integrated into the healthcare system in africa traditional medicine is used for 80 of primary healthcare and in developing nations as a whole over onethird of the population lack access to essential medicines 247some have proposed adopting a prize system to reward medical research 248 however public funding for research exists increasing the funding for research on alternative medicine techniques is the purpose of the us national center for complementary and alternative medicine nccih and its predecessor the office of alternative medicine have spent more than us25 billion on such research since 1992 this research has largely not demonstrated the efficacy of alternative treatments 141 249 250 251that alternative medicine has been on the rise in countries where western science and scientific method generally are accepted as the major foundations for healthcare and evidencebased practice is the dominant paradigm was described as an  enigma  in the medical journal of australia

increase in expenditures and a 25 percent increase in the use of alternative therapies between 1990 and 1997 in america 175 americans spend many billions on the therapies annually 175 most americans used cam to treat andor prevent musculoskeletal conditions or other conditions associated with chronic or recurring pain 11 in america women were more likely than men to use cam with the biggest difference in use of mindbody therapies including prayer specifically for health reasons 11 in 2008 more than 37 of american hospitals offered alternative therapies up from 27 percent in 2005 and 25 in 2004 255 256 more than 70 of the hospitals offering cam were in urban areas 256a survey of americans found that 88 percent thought that there are some good ways of treating sickness that medical science does not recognize 12 use of magnets was the most common tool in energy medicine in america and among users of it 58 percent described it as at least sort of scientific  when it is not at all scientific 12 in 2002 at least 60 percent of us medical schools have at least some class time spent teaching alternative therapies 12 therapeutic touch was taught at more than 100 colleges and universities in 75 countries before the practice was debunked by a nineyearold child for a school science project 12 257prevalence of use of specific therapies  editthe most common cam therapies used in the us in 2002 were prayer 45 herbalism 19 breathing meditation 12 meditation 8 chiropractic medicine 8 yoga 5–6 body work 5 dietbased therapy 4 progressive relaxation 3 megavitamin therapy 3 and visualization 2 11 258in britain the most often used alternative therapies were alexander technique aromatherapy bach and other flower remedies body work therapies including massage counseling stress therapies hypnotherapy meditation reflexology shiatsu ayurvedic medicine nutritional medicine and yoga 259 ayurvedic medicine remedies are mainly plant based with some use of animal materials 260 safety concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in ayurvedic facilities 118 120according to the national health service england the most commonly used complementary and alternative medicines cam supported by the nhs in the uk are acupuncture aromatherapy chiropractic homeopathy massage osteopathy and clinical hypnotherapy 261in palliative care  editcomplementary therapies are often used in palliative care or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients integrative medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine from its early experiences of care for the dying palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life if the patient desired complementary therapies and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient they were considered acceptable 262 the nonpharmacologic interventions of complementary medicine can employ mindbody interventions designed to reduce pain and concomitant mood disturbance and increase quality of life 263regulation  editfurther information regulation of alternative medicine and regulation and prevalence of homeopathy health campaign flyers as in this example from the food and drug administration warn the public about unsafe products in austria and germany complementary and alternative medicine is mainly in the hands of doctors with mds 51 and half or more of the american alternative practitioners are licensed mds 264 in germany herbs are tightly regulated half are prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance 265some professions of complementarytraditionalalternative medicine such as chiropractic have achieved full regulation in north america and other parts of the world 266 and are regulated in a manner similar to that governing sciencebased medicine in contrast other approaches may be partially recognized and others have no regulation at all regulation and licensing of alternative medicine ranges widely from country to country and state to state 266government bodies in the usa and elsewhere have published information or guidance about alternative medicine the u s food and drug administration fda has issued online warnings for consumers about medication health fraud 267 this includes a section on alternative medicine fraud 268 such as a warning that ayurvedic products generally have not been approved by the fda before marketing 269conflicts of interest  editsome commentators have said that special consideration must be given to the issue of conflicts of interest in alternative medicine edzard ernst has said that most researchers into alternative medicine are at risk of unidirectional bias because of a generally uncritical belief in their chosen subject 270 ernst cites as evidence the phenomenon whereby 100 of a sample of acupuncture trials originating in china had positive conclusions 270 david gorski contrasts evidencebased medicine in which researchers try to disprove hyphotheses with what he says is the frequent practice in pseudosciencebased research of striving to confirm preexisting notions 271 harriet hall writes that there is a contrast between the circumstances of alternative medicine practitioners and disinterested scientists in the case of acupuncture for example an acupuncturist would have a great deal to lose if acupuncture were rejected by research but the disinterested skeptic would not lose anything if its effects were confirmed rather their change of mind would enhance their skeptical credentials 272risks  editsee also list of herbs with known adverse effects adequacy of regulation and cam safety  editmany of the claims regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicine are controversial some alternative treatments have been associated with unexpected side effects which can be fatal 273a commonly voiced concerns about complementary alternative medicine cam is the way its regulated there have been significant developments in how cams should be assessed prior to resale in the united kingdom and the european union eu in the last 2 years despite this it has been suggested that current regulatory bodies have been ineffective in preventing deception of patients as many companies have relabelled their drugs to avoid the new laws 274 there is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection from false claims toxicity and advertising with freedom to choose remedies advocates of cam suggest that regulation of the industry will adversely affect patients looking for alternative ways to manage their symptoms even if many of the benefits may represent the placebo affect 275 some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than overthecounter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose such as paracetamol 276interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals  editforms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine examples include immunoaugmentation therapy shark cartilage bioresonance therapy oxygen and ozone therapies and insulin potentiation therapy some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs radiation therapy or anesthetics during surgery among other problems 52 an anecdotal example of these dangers was reported by associate professor alastair mac lennan of adelaide university australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking natural potions to build up her strength before the operation including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death 277to abc online mac lennan also gives another possible mechanism and lastly  sic theres the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off and theyre disappointed and they move on to the next one and theyre disappointed and disillusioned and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult because you may not get compliance because theyve seen the failure so often in the past 278potential sideeffects  editconventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired sideeffects whereas alternative treatments in general are not subjected to such testing at all any treatment – whether conventional or alternative – that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological sideeffects attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the appeal to nature fallacy ie that which is natural cannot be harmful specific groups of patients such as patients with impaired hepatic or renal function are more susceptible to side effects of alternative remedies 279 280an exception to the normal thinking regarding sideeffects is homeopathy since 1938 the u s food and drug administration fda has regulated homeopathic products in several significantly different ways from other drugs 281 homeopathic preparations termed remedies are extremely dilute often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active and possibly toxic ingredient is likely to remain they are thus considered safe on that count but their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs 281treatment delay  editthose having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious possibly lifethreatening illness 282 for this reason critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous according to mental health journalist scott lilienfeld in 2002 unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments and refers to this as  opportunity cost  individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful in short even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes 229 between 2001 and 2003 four children died in australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic homeopathic or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies 230unconventional cancer cures  editthere have always been many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in biomedicine these alternative cancer cures have often been described as unproven suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown however many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in goodquality clinical trials and they have been shown to be ineffective the label unproven is inappropriate for such therapies it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been disproven 217edzard ernst has statedany alternative cancer cure is bogus by definition there will never be an alternative cancer cure why because if something looked halfway promising then mainstream oncology would scrutinize it and if there is anything to it it would become mainstream almost automatically and very quickly all curative alternative cancer cures are based on false claims are bogus and i would say even criminal 283gallery  editchristian laying on of hands prayer intervention and faith healing indian ayurvedic medicine

methods 12 a b c d complementary and alternative medicine cam is a broad domain of resources that encompasses health systems modalities and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs other than those intrinsic to the dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period cam includes such resources perceived by their users as associated with positive health outcomes boundaries within cam and between the cam domain and the domain of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed 13 a b it is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride there cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative there is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work speculation and testimonials do not substitute for evidence 14 a b c the phrase complementary and alternative medicine is used to describe a group of diverse medical and health care systems practices and products that have historic origins outside mainstream medicine most of these practices are used together with conventional therapies and therefore have been called complementary to distinguish them from alternative practices those used as a substitute for standard care  until a decade ago or so complementary and alternative medicine could be defined as practices that are neither taught in medical schools nor reimbursed but this definition is no longer workable since medical students increasingly seek and receive some instruction about complementary health practices and some practices are reimbursed by thirdparty payers another definition practices that lack an evidence base is also not useful since there is a growing body of research on some of these modalities and some aspects of standard care do not have a strong evidence base 19 an alternative medical system is a set of practices based on a philosophy different from western biomedicine 20 cam is a group of diverse medical and health care systems practices and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine 21 the final report 2002 of the white house commission on complementary and alternative medicine policy states the commissioners believe and have repeatedly stated in this report that our response should be to hold all systems of health and healing including conventional and cam to the same rigorous standards of good science and health services research although the commissioners support the provision of the most accurate information about the state of the science of all cam modalities they believe that it is premature to advocate the wide implementation and reimbursement of cam modalities that are yet unproven 32 mary ruggie in chapter 2 of marginal to mainstream alternative medicine in america said by the mid1990s the notion that some alternative therapies could be complementary to conventional medicine began to change the status ofalternative medicine the 21st century is witnessing yet another terminological innovation in which cam and conventional medicine are becoming integrative 59 as david j hufford professor and director at the doctors kienle center for humanistic medicine at the penn state college of medicine 71 has argued simply because an herbal remedy comes to be used by physicians does not mean that herbalists cease to practice or that the practice of the one becomes like that of the other 72 the bma used the term nonconventional medicine instead of alternative medicine 74 the office for alternative medicine part of the national institutes of health was renamed nccam in 1998 82 evidence based medicine is the conscientious explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients 94 evidence based medicine whose philosophical origins extend back to mid19th century paris and earlier remains a hot topic for clinicians public health practitioners purchasers planners and the public british centres for evidence based practice have been established or planned in adult medicine child health surgery pathology pharmacotherapy nursing general practice and dentistry the cochrane collaboration and britains centre for review and dissemination in york are providing systematic reviews of the effects of health care 94 in his book the homœopathic medical doctrine samuel hahnemann the creator of homeopathy wrote observation reflection and experience have unfolded to me that the best and true method of cure is founded on the principle similia similibus curentur to cure in a mild prompt safe and durable manner it is necessary to choose in each case a medicine that will excite an affection similar  ὅμοιος πάθος to that against which it is employed 106 peking university health science center formerly beijing medical university was the first of the kind in china to teach western medicine and train medical professionals  citation needed for an encyclopaedic account of the development of western medicine in the period leading up to the reforms in the medical schools of us resulting from the flexner report published at the time of that report see the article allbutt thomas clifford 1911  medicine  in chisholm hugh encyclopædia britannica 18 11th ed cambridge university press in his introduction to the flexner report henry s pritchett stated the fundamental sciences upon which medicine depends have been greatly extended the laboratory has come to furnish alike to the physician and to the surgeon a new means for diagnosing and combating disease the education of the medical practitioner under these changed conditions makes entirely different demands in respect of both preliminary and professional training 164 the earliest occurrence of the term alternative medicine in an english language publication was only in 1974 according to the oxford english dictionary 169 as the medical professor kenneth m ludmerer noted in 2010 flexner pointed out that the scientific method of thinking applied to medical practice by scientific method he meant testing ideas with wellplanned experiments to establish accurate facts the clinicians diagnosis was equivalent to the scientists hypothesis both medical diagnosis and hypothesis required the test of an experiment flexner argued that mastery of the scientific method of problem solving was the key for physicians to manage medical uncertainty and to practice in the most costeffective way 178 as a 2010 article in the new england journal of medicine concludedreal acupuncture treatments were no more effective than sham acupuncture treatments there was nevertheless evidence that both real acupuncture and sham acupuncture were more effective than no treatment and that acupuncture can be a useful supplement to other forms of conventional therapy for low back pain 238 according to the medical historian james harvey young in 1991 the senate appropriations committee responsible for funding the national institutes of health nih declared itself not satisfied that the conventional medical community as symbolized at the nih has fully explored the potential that exists in unconventional medical practices 241references  edit 25 billion spent no alternative cures found msnbccom 20090610 retrieved 20170922 fisken roger a
