rating corned beef is made from brisket brisket is the meat from the front part of the cow  under the neck and above the legs its a particularly muscular part of the cow so it can be pretty tough the brisket has two pieces  one is tougher and about twice as big the other piece is more marbled regardless brisket should be cooked very slowly because otherwise it will be tough corned beef is typically marinated in a brine for about 10 days in a mix of water salt and spices a tablespoon or two of salt petre can be used to make it that unique pink color but it does contain nitrates so some
