paper the non binding guidelines below are intended to maximize your papers readability they are optional so use your own judgment as to whether to follow them or not most likely your decision will vary from case to case note in the examples below we use mlastyle parenthetical intext references however the same recommendations hold true for chicagostyle footnotes optional rule  1as a rule place footnotes or references at the end of sentences avoid placing them in the middle of sentences if possible avoid the claim that the rape of nanking surpasses much of the worst barbarism of the ages  chang 5 has been a source of disagreement between western and japanese scholars preferable the claim that the rape of nanking surpasses much of the worst barbarism of the ages has been a source of disagreement between western and japanese scholars chang 5 optional rule  2 if in one paragraph you list multiple quotes from the same page of a source there is no need to cite that source anew each time use just one reference instead placed after the last of your quotes or perhaps at the end of the paragraph to sum up the shared source of all your quotes avoid the claim that the rape of nanking surpasses much of the worst barbarism of the ages has been a source of disagreement between western and japanese scholars  chang 5  chineseamerican scholar iris chang argues that the rape of nanking

aloneexceeds the number of civilian casualties of some european countries for the entire war chang 5 optional rule  3 even if multiple quotes from one source are not from the same exact page as above you can still summarize them in one reference placed after the last of your quotes or at the end of the paragraph in this case the individual page numbers cited are separated by commas in both mla and chicago example some western historians claim that the rape of nanking surpasses much of the worst barbarism of the ages iris chang for example describes corpses piled up outside the city walls along the river which had turned red with blood ponds and lakes and on hills and mountains chang 5 46 note when summarizing multiple quotes from the same source in one reference the order of the page numbers listed in the reference reflects the order in which the quotes are listed in your text the above reference chang 5 46 indicates that the firstcited quote is from p 5 while the second is from p 46 optional rule  4even if a paragraph lists quotes from more than one source you can still summarize them into one reference placed after the last quote or at the end of the paragraph in this case separate the different authors listed in your reference by a semicolon in both mla and chicago example writing on the rape of nanking iris chang describes corpses piled up outside the city walls along the river which had turned red with blood ponds and lakes and on hills and mountains japanese scholars however dispute this version of events suggesting that chang describes mountains of dead bodies that no one saw chang 46 masaaki ch 4 note the order in which the citations are listed in the reference reflects the order in which the quotes themselves are listed in the text the above reference chang 46 masaaki ch 4 indicates that the first quote is from chang p 46 followed by a quote from masaaki a website chapter four final note dont go overboard when summarizing multiple sources in one reference excessively lengthy references can become confusing to your reader mla recommends listing no more than three sources maximum in any one reference as ever use your own judgment its your paper you decide and dont worry if your decisions vary from case to case the most important thing is that the source of each of your quotes is clearly identified in your references and that the placement of your references does not obstruct the flow of your paper back to topthe use of single quotation marks quotes within quotesall quotes are placed in double quotation marks with one exception binding rule if a passage you are citing contains a quote the quote within your quote is placed in single quotation marks consider the following passage from the fourth chapter of tanaka masaakis website what really happened in nanking the refutation of a common myth this is the original passage as printed in the website word for word down to the punctuation no one saw mountains of dead bodies or rivers of blood when quoting this passage the quotes within the quote mountains of dead bodies and rivers of blood are placed in single quotation marks  according to japanese scholar tanaka masaaki no one saw  mountains of dead bodies or rivers of blood  masaaki ch 4 the rule again when quoting a passage that contains a quote the quote within the quote is placed in single quotation marks as above notice that the larger quote within which the quotewithinthequote is embedded is placed in double quotation marks as ever back to topblock quotes lengthy quotesalthough we generally recommend using quotes strategically and therefore sparingly there may be times when you need to quote lengthy passages to illustrate or prove your claims such lengthy quotes are formatted as block quotes what is a lengthy quote there is no absolute rule as to what constitutes a lengthy quote  some teachers say a quote is lengthy if it exceeds four or five typed lines others if it exceeds forty words or four sentences the point is once a quote becomes unusually lengthy it is formatted as a block quote whatis a block quote how is it formatted a block quote is a lengthy quote that is visually set off from the rest of your paper it is singlespaced rather than doublespaced like the rest of your paper and indented an additional half inch so that it visually draws attention to itself on the page the objective is to signal to the reader even from a distance that what follows is a lengthy quote a block quote is not placed in quotation marks example chineseamerican historian iris chang offers the following statistics in her effort to illustrate the full scope of the nanking massacre one historian has estimated that if the dead from nanking were to link hands they would stretch from nanking to the city of hangchow spanning a distance of some two hundred miles their blood would weigh twelve hundred tons and their bodies would fill twentyfive hundred railroad cars stacked on top of each other they would reach the height of a seventyfourstory building chang 5note that in mla as shown abovethe final punctuation of a block quote  unlike the punctuation for a regular short quote  is placed immediately after the end of the last sentence preceding not following the parenthetical reference back to topmodifying the wording of a quote without changing its meaning sometimes it is necessary to modify the wording of a quote in order to make it flow more smoothly to add relevant information to change its tense to suit the point you are trying to make or to ensure that its transition in or out of your prose is grammatically correct as long as you do not alter the fundamental meaning of the original passage it is permissible to make such grammatical and stylistic changes to signal to the reader that your modifications are not part of the original passage quoted such changes and additions are placed in square brackets example consider the following passage from iris changs the rape of nankingany attempt to set the record straight must shed light on how the japanese as a people manage nurture and sustain their collective amnesiaeven denialwhen confronted with the record of their behavior through that period chang 15 now consider the following quote from the above passage writing in 1997 iris chang was undoubtedly correct that japans version of the nanking massacre exemplified how the japanese as a people  once manage  d  nurture  d  and sustain  ed their collective amnesiaeven denialwhen confronted with the record of their behavior through  the period  of world war ii  today more than ten years after the publication of changs work those few japanese scholars who still continue to deny the events that occurred at nanking in 1937 are unlikely to ever come around to share her view chang 15 notice that the material added is placed in square brackets visually indicating to the reader that it is not part of the original text notice also that although we have altered the tense of the quote from present to past and through the addition of the word once changed an article from that to the and added information to specify the world war ii period we have not fundamentally altered the original meaning of the quote which remains clearly discernible the rule again any modifications to a quote must be placed within square brackets you can modify as long as you do not change a quotes meaning on this see also the ethics of quoting  back to topellipses another way in which you can modify a quote is by skipping material perhaps the quote is too long or perhaps it contains unnecessarily detailed information there are many reasons why you may wish to skip part of a quote and as long as you do not alter the original meaning of the passage you are free to do so the rule indicate that you have skipped material within a quote by placing three periods an ellipsis in place of the missing material do not place an ellipsis at the beginning or end of a quote ever only to indicate skipped material in the middle of a quote example consider the following sentence from iris changs the rape of nankingcorpses piled up outside the city walls along the river which had turned red with blood ponds and lakes and on hills and mountains chang 46 if you wish to skip part of this quote the parenthetical comment for example indicate its omission through the use of an ellipsis writing of the nanking massacre in 1937 iris chang describes corpses piled up outside the city walls along the river  in ponds and lakes and on hills and mountains chang 46 two important reminders remember that you can skip material in a quote only if your doing so does not change the meaning of the original passage see the ethics of quoting on this and do not place ellipses at the beginning or end of quotes ever only in the middle to indicate skipped material back to topworks cited chang iris the rape of nanking the forgotten holocaust of world war ii new york basic
