you are here home  recipes  tiramisu cake tiramisu cake february 5 2016 by david 48 comments featuring layers of white cake brushed with coffee and a hint of dark rum this tiramisu cake is a new favorite in our houseraise your hand if you’re a coffee addict if you just like a good cup of joe then you can keep your hand down mominlaw you can keep your hand raised my motherinlaw has been staying with us a good bit lately and she loves coffee i’m talking like 67 cups a day in her defense she does switch to decaf somewhere around 4pm but holy cowmy wife and i look forward to our morning cup of coffee and we like our java strong the stronger the better as far as we’re concerned funny story we have one of those big coffee machines that grinds beans for each cup we tinkered with the settings so that it makes a pretty strong cup of coffee that strong coffee has been a lifesaver with all of the late nights we’ve been pulling with robbie we made mominlaw a cup of coffee from that machine one morning and she could barely finish it so now we have a keurig set up in the kitchen right next to our coffee machine that’s right we have two ways to make coffee…as if we needed more stuff on our countersgiven the insanely high amount of coffee being made in our house every day i decided to grab a bit and make a javainspired dessert tiramisu one of my alltime favorite desserts in fact tiramisu is one of the first desserts that i ever learned how to make after graduating from college it is pretty simple and pretty impressive to serve to company or for dessert when i made dinner for my futurewife but i didn’t go straight traditional with this tiramisu i turned it into a cake a tiramisu cake white cake brushed with coffee  rum frosted with mascarpone frosting this cake was amazing y’all and for garnish i stopped by a local italian market and picked up a bulk pack of ladyfingers these were legit authentic italian ladyfingers too no english at all on the package and the other nice thing about using ladyfingers as garnish i didn’t have to worry about making the sides of this cake look nice i knew the ladyfingers would hide any blemishes or blobs of uneven frosting and since we clearly needed to increase our coffee consumption in this house note the sarcasm i decided to serve slices of this cake alongside a hot cup of coffee this tiramisu cake is definitely up there on my life of favorite cakes now my wife said she loved it so much that she might request it for her birthday next year hopefully we don’t run out of coffee before thenhow do you like your coffee i

whipped cream around the edge of the top of the cake gently press the ladyfingers into frosting on sides of cake notes like tiramisu this cake tastes best cold plan on refrigerating this cake for several hours before serving i prefer to refrigerate this cake and then add the ladyfingers right before serving just keep a bit of extra frosting and spread a bit on the back of each ladyfinger once refrigerated the ladyfingers will soften related posts chocolate chocolate cake southern red velvet cake strawberry almond heart cake comments1kathy  beyond the chicken coop says february 5 2016 at

i’m so excited to try and make this6dannii  hungry healthy happy says february 5 2016 at 813 am now i never used to like tiramisu i know but hear me out i love coffee but not coffee flavoured things i am the same with strawberries and strawberry flavoured things but when we were in rome a couple of years ago dave ordered some it’s his favourite and i thought “when in rome” and tried some it was amazing i guess i just needed to try the real deal yours looks so delicious and beautifully presented reply7david says february 8 2016 at 904 am haha…good for you dannii i was the same way…except opposite i liked coffee flavored things ie coffee ice cream but not actual coffee that was way back in college though and now i love my morning cup of coffee nothing beats it thanks so much…i hope you and dave had an awesome weekend over therereply8lauren says february 5 2016 at 818 am espresso hands down espresso though i have 4 different ways to make coffee at our house just in case my inlaws are quantity coffee drinkers as well tiramisu i need to figure out how to make gluten free lady fingers because this cake totally has to be part of my life reply9david says february 8 2016 at 909 am oh i like the way you think lauren i love a good shot of espresso we like our coffee strong so it’s not a far reach to step up to espresso i much prefer one good cup of coffee to a zillion cups of weak bad coffee i bet glutenfree lady fingers could totally be made and if anyone can figure it out it’s you seriously though i bet bob’s 1to1 flour mix would do a pretty good job for lady fingers…just a thought reply10phronsie says february 5 2016 at 834 am love this recipe reply11david says february 8 2016 at 909 am thanks phronsie it’s a good one…especially if you like coffeeflavored

dessertsreply15david says february 8 2016 at 915 am tell me about it mara ladyfingers are clutch because they look awesome and they hide any sort of lazy frosting job don’t be surprised if you start seeing ladyfingers on the sides of all of my cakes…haha i was the same as you back in college i loved coffee desserts but not actual coffee then the transition happened and now i’m a big fan of my morning cup of joereply16shashi at runnin srilankan says february 5 2016 at 1007 am haha – while i do adore my coffee i don’t think i like it spoonstandupstrong lil shashi and i have 2 coffee machines

spiced – this cake should be birthdaychristmasnew yeait’sfriday cake what a masterpiece simply stellar david or like lil shashi would say “this cake is legit” tiramisu is my all time fav dessert i’d

920 am haha this is most definitely a “it’s friday and we should celebrate like it’s 1999″ cake it’s indeed what the young whippersnappers might call legit and nope this storm missed us too we’re still at roughly 3” on the year…and that was way back in middecember if i recall we’re like two magnets repelling all of the snow storms i keep waiting for the big one to hit though…and in that situation i’ll just sit inside with a slice of tiramisu cake and a cup of coffeereply18puja darshan says february 5 2016 at 1026 am coffee…it’s my favorite…yummy treat reply19david says february 8

thank you dorothy i wouldn’t say that all of my desserts look like something from an upscale bakery and my kitchen definitely does not look like an upscale bakery when i’m done with it…haha i bet you can find ladyfingers bakery dept and mascarpone dairycheese dept they are indeed a bit on the harder to find side but i think they are still common enough at least i hope so if not i’ll just mail you

if it’s tiramisu what a tall impressive tiramisu it just looks so massive i bet it disappears real fast no matter how big it is i love the pic where i’m looking at the slice cut out from the center makes me crave eating that missing slice pinnedreply27david says february 8 2016 at 930 am oh this cake was most definitely impressive…but better than that it was delicious i mean it’s one thing if desserts look nice but i put more weight on taste and anything coffeeflavored is going to rank pretty high up on our list that missing slice didn’t stick around too much longer after these pics were taken either hahareply28arman  thebigmansworld says february 5 2016 at 345 pm you married tiramisu and cake  you are officially a legendconfession you guys here confuse me so much at starbucks all this time i thought a dark roast meant it would be much stronger but no…light roast is how does that make sense reply29david says february 8 2016 at 931 am and may they live happily forever after mate you should go get a job at starbucks…then you can have all the coffee you wantreply30lisa  chocolate meets strawberry says february 6 2016 at 502 am what a fantastic idea to turn tiramisu into a cake i’ve never been great at making tiramisu but absolutely love it and cake is always a good idea how could it not be  so this is seriously tantalising my tastebuds right now what a great way to use up the very large amount of coffee being produced in your house reply31david says february 8 2016 at 933 am tiramisu is totally one of my favorite desserts but you are right…everything is better in cake

absolutely save you a slice of this cake…but you have to hurryreply34jeff the chef says february 6 2016 at 923 am i made tiramisu out of twinkies and cool whip once i have a feeling yours would win out in a taste test though it looks really goodreply35david says february 8 2016 at 938 am hmmm…i like the way you think jeff but did you include some sanka in there if not that would have been a depressing tiramisu reply36jeff the chef says february 8 2016 at 409 pm i actually poured an espresso into it and dusted it with cocoa i have to say it was shockingly good considerin it’s lowbrow provenance sanka would’ve been an amazing choice though reply37june  how to philosophize with cake says february 6 2016 at 524 pm oh wow this looks incredible i love traditional tiramisu but anything in layer cake form has to be good reply38david says february 8 2016 at 939 am i totally agree june turn it into a layer cake and everything is better well…almost everything no one wants a broccoliflavored layer cake reply39marcela says february 8 2016 at 613 amthis cake is perfect looks like you just bought it i’m sure it tastes great love traditional tiramisu so this cake is on the top of my ‘to bake list’reply40david says february 8 2016 at 940 am haha thank you so much marcela i had fun making this cake…and the ladyfingers are a huge timesaver as you don’t have to make the frosting on the sides look nice this cake is definitely up there on my top 3 cakes list it’s a keeperreply41ben maclain says february 8 2016 at 908 pm tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts david i discovered it many years ago and i’ve tried a number of flavors surprisingly i didn’t incorporate lavender yet i love that version when it’s served in a large bowl and when it’s very moist i know a lot of people can’t stand too moist tiramisu but even though you didn’t manage to put this cake in the bowl haha i would like to have a piece by i piece i mean 14 of the cake with my coffee and since you are asking i don’t drink much coffee – usually 1 large cup but it should be very strong and ilove it flavored too reply42david says february 9 2016 at 831 am i’m with you 100 ben i love tiramisu and i’ll never ever turn it down how about this i’ll cut you a slice of this tiramisu cake and then put it in a bowl and i’ll serve it with one very strong cup of coffee deal reply43tamara says march

desserts i mean i love this cake reply44david says march 3 2016 at 720 am thank you so much tamara i had so much fun making this cake too granted i had more fun eating it…but making it was still a lot of fun to me and i think we might still have a couple of pieces wrapped up in the freezer too…score reply45lucy  globe scoffers says march 3 2016 at 1117 am wow this cake looks amazing i love tiramisu

you enjoy itreply47flavia cappucci says november 21 2016 at 643 pm hello you cake is a wonderfoul idea congrats being both from italian family me and my husband are very seriuous about tiramisu we usually add eggs  yolks to the mascarpone cheese do you think it will work in this recipe thanks reply48david says november 22 2016 at 742 am hey there flavia thank you so much for the kind words tiramisu is seriously one of my favorite desserts of all time so i think you could totally add egg yolks to the mascarpone cheese here i use egg yolks in my traditional tiramisu recipe but i left them out here in the cake frosting the only thing you might need to do is increase the powdered sugar slightly to offset the additional liquid from the egg yolks…but i think it could definitely work i do hope you enjoy this cake as much as we do thanks for stopping by and commentingreply leave a reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment notify me of followup
