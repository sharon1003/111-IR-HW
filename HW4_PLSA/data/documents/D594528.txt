handsonanatomist human anatomy and physiology 815 points 4 years ago the absolute refractory period of cardiac muscle is between 250 and 300 ms that means cardiac contractions are physiologically limited to 200240 beats per minute there are other physiological factors that can cause problems well before this limit however these are primarily issues related to blood flow both to the heart muscle itself and to the systemic circuit but since you seemed to want the fastest rate figure 240 bpm as an absolute upper limitpermalink embed save – invisiblemovement 93 points 4 years ago the issues relating to blood flow would they just be that the heart cant fill chambers fast enough or cant oxygenate the in the lungspermalink embed save parent – wehrmanntx 114 points 4 years ago heart cant fill fast enough so the output is severely diminished since the output goes down not only does it not fill fast enough but the blood coming either back from the lungs or filling from the vena cava pressure drops and that gives less to fill as welltldr cant fill fast enough to pump enough for body needs doesnt pump enough for body needs makes it fill slower cutting the amount even morepermalink embed save parent – americanpig 27 points 4 years ago decreasing cardiac output if anything will increase venous preload thats why people with heart failure inability to pump sufficient blood out of the heart will often have lungs filling with fluid from the increased pulmonary venous pressure and bulging neck veins from the blood backing up into the jugulars theyll even have liver problems from hepatic venous congestion the blood has to go someplace and if the hearts not pumping it out itll just back uppermalink embed save parent – tdunks19 26 points 4 years ago output overall

handsonanatomist mentions it has to do with blood flow to the myocardium heart muscle itself the heart muscle itself only receives oxygen during diastole relaxation but as heart rate increases the relative length of diastole shortens compared to systole heart contraction tldr your heart gets tired because it only gets oxygen while relaxed and the relative amount of time spent relaxing is

machines rarely exhibited errors exceeding 23 bpm over a measurement range of 30240 bpm however when tested with subjects walking or jogging at low speeds on a treadmill typically 2070 of the readings given by the machines had errors of greater than 20 bpm in some cases over 50 of readings had errors exceeding 50 bpm none of the products tested were similar to the monitor on the stationary bike but warning warning anecdote in my experience they are generally unreliable ive used a fair amount over the past 20 years and different brands have different levels of accuracy but to avoid going too far into anecdotes i just recently bought a midgrade treadmill and it clearly states in the documentation that the heart rate monitor is for general trends only and is not an accurate medical device i can confirm this by it jumping from 80bpm to 150bpm and back regularly but using the polar cheststrap monitor that comes with it is much more accurate so the point is that the touch monitors on exercise equipment are likely only accurate to the extent the manufacturer was willing to expend money on an accurate monitor vs punting on a cheap one plus variation in skin moisture from sweat or lack of is likely has some impact on the accuracy as well either way the manufacturer will likely only bill it as something to show general trends to avoid any legal issues from being called a medical device

insight you have to first determine what a persons maximum heart rate this was 220  age however the method used to determine this formula wasnt reliable and its more an average then a personal indicator source study performed on the optimum upper heart rate limit using pacemaker patients you could disregard this due to the people used for the study but the material is worth looking at considering the article i mentioned abstract paperpermalink embed save – max payne narrative 9 points 4 years ago in addition to not being completely reliable the 220  age number really isnt the maximum rate that the heart can beat its the maximum rate that the sinoatrial sa node the hearts natural pacemaker will depolarize in completely healthy people the sa node tells the heart when to beat and so heart rate will be constrained to 220  age beats per minute however in some people dysfunction of the conducting network that transmits the message from the sa node to the ventricles will cause other parts of the heart to take over the job of telling the heart when to beat and these other areas have a faster rate of depolarization allowing the heart to beat somewhat faster than 220  age people actually dont need to be super sick to have this be the case and there are plenty of people living relatively normal lives free from the tyranny of their sa nodes additionally there are some instances when the ventricles will stop taking orders from anyone and start marching to the beat of their own drum one signal comes in telling the ventricles to contract and rather than contracting once as they normally would they keep bouncing that signal around contracting again and again in response to only one stimulus for an analogy thinking of fans at a sports game doing the wave in response to prompting from the jumbotron theres the initial external influence from the jumbotron but after that cuts out the wave just keeps going round and round the stadium because people stand up in response to the person next to them standing up muscle fibers do the exact same thing this is ventricular tachycardia it is the sign of a very sick person and generally isnt viable for longlife the heart is not pumping very efficiently and isnt moving much blood despite the high rate but it is when youll get the fastest heart rates rates that can certainly exceed 220age ventricular tachycardia is a heart rhythm that may be shocked with paddles though it isnt always and ill just state here because everyone learns incorrectly from tvmovies but asystole the flatline on the ekg is never shocked

is being evidence based and still understandable for redditors is one hell of a challenge typically a normal sinusrythm will have a maximum of 210age rule of thumb this can be reached during all kinds of stress excercise disease ie all kinds of conditions ranging from fever to sepsis or medically induced however there are many tachyarrythmias that can cause very quick electrical conduction through the heart the concept of normal electrical conduction is as follows the sinus node is where the electricity originates from there it follows a strict pattern over the atria causing the atria to contract all electrical circuits then bundle in the avnode where the electrical signal is delayed from there it passes through the hisbundle in the ventricles eventually leading to the contraction of the ventricles this results in the blood being pumped from the atria to the ventricles and out to the lungs or in the aorta and onwards a maximum heartrate is limited by two electrical principles electrical conductivity of the fibers from the sinus node and onward as well as the electrical conductivity of the muscle fibers but also the mechanical contraction of the heart limits the maximum heart rate the electrical conductivity is limited by the timespan the individual cells in both the electrical wiring and the muscles are receptible to electricity and be activated to conduct or contract the electrical fibers are quicker than the actual muscle fibers the period in which theyre not receptible is called the refractible period technically the cell needs to exchange ions to reload which is slower than the cells releasing ions when conductingcontracting muscle cells that do the contracting will typically need more time to reload so it is possible that electrical activity gets to the muscle and not lead to a contraction the mechanical limits are that to pump out the blood the heart will need to be able to contract lower the volume of the ventricles and that too is pure physics you can only do that at about 200 bpm tops the smaller the heart the more quickly the mechanical action can be but even the smallest of animals have a limited heartrate i dont remember the exact limit though if the mechanical action quickens the effectivity of the contraction gets less and less because the muscles need to relax to fill the heart atria and ventricles again before the next heartbeat and the really high heartrates usually mean that the heart pumps out hardly anything per heartbeat but because it is a very high rate it amounts to quite a lot over time like one minute this is measured in cardiac output in tachyarrythmias the electrical conduction is not normal either an accessory pathway between atria and ventricles exist bypassing the avnode leading to a loop in electrical activity either between the atria and the ventricles or in the atria or ventricles alone the heart doesnt blow up or at least not to the best of my knowledge because once the heartrate increases at a certain point the cardiac output in volumeminute will decrease after increasing at first at a certain point which starts at 200 bpm the blood pumped out by the heart is close to nothing this leads to lower perfusion in the coronary arteries and the rest of the body which cuts off the blood supply to the heart itself since muscles need energy and oxygen to function the heart stops when its blood supply is cut off tachycardias can exist for a longer period of time and compensation the heart will dilate meaning that the ventricles usually the left ventricle in particular will dilate as well the volume will increase meaning pure physics that the percentage of the volume will lead to higher cardiac output a normal healthy heart will pump out about 60 of its volume per beat a dilated heart in extreme situations will pump out about 10 the fastest a heart could beat safely is dependent on a lot of factors one of them is age younger individuals get higher heartrates 210age as a rule of thumb says it all because the electrical conduction in their heart is not yet damaged or compromised age will do that another thing is size the smaller the healthy heart the faster it goes children have higher heartrates than adults newborns have a normal heartrate of 120160 bpm whereas adults are in between 6080 bpm sidenote if the electrical signal is fast it doesnt mean the ventricles are filled up just yet so seeing a heartbeat on an ecg  electrical activity really sensitive does not mean you will feel the pulse in an artery simply because theres not enough volume to cause a pulsewave at a certain distance or a pulse wave that is is enough to actually be sensed by your sensory nervous system in your fingers the closer to the heart you feel for pulsations the higher the chance of actually detecting the pulse listening with a stethoscope will always tell you if there actually is mechanical activity after that the carotid or femoral arteries will tell you if it causes sufficient cardiac output to have adequate organ perfusion ie brain you kind of need that one for every other bodily function sources if a professional you should check up to date for the basics and then search pub med but those arent available freely online since what you ask is basic textbook knowledge check out wikipedia yes i said it and search up to date if you have access or get

wont specifically answer you question but it will go a ways to giving you the necessary information to build your own answer im a medical student here in england and have done 4 years training already the basicsthe human heart contains 2 atria and 2 ventricles the ventricles are the main important ones as they control rate rhythm and volume of blood being pumped they are important as if they stop pumping the blood stops flowing the contraction starts in a special part of the atria called the sinoatrial node san and pass through the atria across the muscle to the atrioventricular node avn at the avn there is a slight delay and the signal passes down into the bundle of his and to the bottom of the heart and back up to force the ventricles to contract in an organized manner pushing blood out the top of the heart into the main vessels the cells of the heart are cardiac muscle cells theyre similar to skeletal muscles eg biceps but differ slightly in their make up arrangement and chemistry the signal in these is set off when the avn tells them to contract and through gap junctions the signal is passed along the chain of cells when we get down to the chemical level these cells are turning on and off by moving ions in and out of the cells therefore it takes a little while for ions to move back into the cell before it can contract again this is called the refractory period somebody else has mentioned that here too this is important but hearts dont usually contract immediately after this period is up they wait for the signal from the avn in order to cause them to contract in an organised way bottom to top so if the signal is coming in quickly the heart muscle has to at least wait out this portion of refractory period we call the period of time in which the heart is contracting systole and when it isnt its relaxed is called disatole blood supplythe blood supply of the heart is via the coronary arteries these are the first divisions of the aorta the main vessel leaving the heart they come from behind the valve folds when the heart contracts blood is forced out it hits the pressure in the aorta and a wave is eventually pushed back down the aorta this fills the folds of the valve and within those folds is the opening to the coronary arteries therefore the coronary arteries only fill during diastole the faster the heart is beating the shorter the relative periods of diastole last for and the decreased amount of time there is to fill the heart vessels and provide oxygen to the muscle the coronary arteries are vital and if they are not being filled the muscle begins to tire very quickly due to lack of oxygen and glucose being supplied when the muscle tires it doesnt pump as fast or hard it also causes chest pain usually in a heart attack myocardial infarction or angina attack the coronary arteries become filled with a blood clot and this stops the blood getting to the heart muscle and the pain occurs if this isnt resolved by reperfusion happening then the heart muscle dies and this can cause lots of heart muscle problems if the heart is contracting too fast then it doesnt get as much blood supply and it will get damage depending on the state of your blood vessels you heart can contract faster if there is narrowing due to atherosclerosis this limit is lowered fibrillation and abnormal beatingwhen the heart is contracting as normal it is okay but when damage occurs ie infection chronic high blood pressure ischaemia heart attack the muscle can become damaged and this can lead to abnormal unmediated contraction of the muscle this is sometimes just extreme tachycardia very fast dangerous heart beatingpalpitations and is sometimes fibrillation fibrillation means all the cells or groups of them are contracting without being told to and are just doing it over and over instead of a synchronized beating there is just wobblingwaveringshaking of the muscle and this is bad it occurs in the atria atrial fibrillation and is not as severe it causes the blood to not move stasis and it can cause tachycardia in the ventricles svt supraventricular tachycardia we treat this very quicklysoonit can also occur in the ventricles vf if this happens the patient quickly loses perfusion to the heart brain lungs kidneys everything and if they are not treated quickly they will die this is what you see on television when people are treated with shocks thumps and adrenaline epinephrine in af there is something like 300bpm and in some cells as fast as 500bpm vf is severe and patient often dies within minutes if no help arrives ventricular tachycardia can reach as high as 200bpm svt but the patient needs intervention to stop heart muscle damage conclusionive missed a lot out but i hope that helps

answer the question for a more complete review of cardiac physiology see lange cardio physiology further this answer is wrong as cardiac cells are not capable of beating faster than 250300 bpm due to absolute refractory periods if you reach 500bpm there must be a serious pathological condition already in place also there is more than one pacemaker in the heart the sa node is just the fastestpermalink embed save parent – meowrawr 2 points 4 years ago i think the problem here is defining what one heart beat means to the lay person obviously rapid afib could appear extremely high but

seemspermalink embed save parentload more comments 2 repliesload more comments 2 replies – jch32 3 points 4 years ago it depends on what safely means but my best answer is that you start to get inefficiency in the cardiac cycle above about 160bpm as your diastolic filling time has decreased to the point that you are not providing sufficient preload to tension the myocardial fibers and maximize contractile force based on the frankstarling law interjection for those of you that dont know the frankstarling law states that the stroke volume of the heart ie how much blood is pumped out of the ventricle during the contractile phase of the cardiac cycle systole increases with increased end diastolic volume ie how much blood is in the ventricle at the end of the heart filling phase diastole and that this is a function of the increased end diastolic volume stretching the myocytes heart muscle fibers which causes an increase in the contractility of the myocytes there is some underlying physiology and i can get into it if you want so stretching the hearts muscle fibers literally causes it to contract harder and as a result you pump out more blood during contraction as you go higher above 160bpm you continue to decrease diastolic filling time which not only further decreases the contribution of the frankstarling law to your ultimate stroke volume but simply decreases end diastolic volume so the the ultimate volume available to contribute to your stroke volume is reduced as well given the fact that your contractility is no longer optimum you cant expect your ejection fraction to increase to compensate for the decreased end diastolic volume so not only is there less blood available at the end of diastole you arent ejecting as much of it during contraction as you would if your heart were beating at a slower rate now to get to failing above this heart rate a lot of people will begin to feel panicky and may experience syncope the heart wont explode but as you continue to get to faster and faster heart rates ie 250 in vfib the effects of asynchronous contraction in a fibrillating ventricle aside your cardiac output is not only no longer sufficient to provide blood to your brain which happened a long time ago when you passed out but it is no longer sufficient to supply your heart whats even worse we mentioned that diastole was shortened above well diastole is the time for the heart to get its blood because blood doesnt flow well through vessels that are collapsed by the muscular force of a contracting heart during systole so this is a double whammy in the sense that not only is cardiac output super low at this point because your stroke volume is essentially nonexistent but also what little blood youre ejecting has essentially zero time to supply the actual heart musculature with blood but your heart is working super hard and it really needs oxygen well thats too bad youre essentially globally infarcting your heart global heart attack and it will eventually stop beatingpermalink embed saveload more comments 1 reply  deleted 4 years ago 1 childload more comments 82 replies
