5 steps to writing a successful business proposal1 gather the information you need when a hot business opportunity becomes available you may feel pressure to get your proposal sent over as soon as possible while you certainly want to send it sooner than later taking some time to learn about the client and project first will help you craft a proposal that’s more likely to be accepted according to andy freivogel of science retail a simple rule of thumb is to send a proposal after your first meeting include a personal note that acts as a follow up “hey it was great connecting the other day…” then attach your proposal there are exceptions to this rule for example if a business has multiple officeslocations you may need to visit more of them before you can accurately assess the project in this scenario timing requires the right balance you don’t want to send a proposal prematurely— especially if you can’t accurately estimate costs— but you also don’t want to provide too much free labor as we’ll explain more below one solution is to include caveats these will allow you to send your proposals quickly while also protecting you from unexpected turns the project may take pro tip use a

insightly for free visit insightly2 outline the scope of the project before you start typing out the proposal itself take a moment to reflect on the project answer the “who what where how when and why”who who will do the work who will manage the work who does the customer call if there is a problem what what needs to be donedelivered what will be required to do it what can the customer expect what will it cost where where will the work be done where will it be delivered when when will you start when will key milestones be scheduled when will the project be complete when is payment due how how will be work be done how will it be deployed how will it be managed how will you achieve quality assurance and customer satisfaction how will risks be mitigated how long will it take how will the work benefit the customer why why have you chosen the approaches and alternatives you have selected why should the customer select you writing these out will give you a head start on your proposal since these answers will make up the bulk of your body it also gives you final confirmation that you have the necessary resources to complete the project – or otherwise will point out any major snags before you get too invested estimating labor and costs early on you also want to consider how much the project will cost – and thus in turn how much to charge the client as andy told us many businesses use a simple formula to estimate their labor costs take a mental walkthrough of the project  write down the realistic number of hours it will take for each task add all of this up and multiply it by 15 in other words if you estimate a project will take 10 hours write it down as 15 hours in your proposal 10  15  15why overestimate despite how it seems this isn’t to squeeze any extra bucks out of the customers rather it’s because projects often have unexpected twists and turns adding this extra time will help account for any potential snags plus if everything goes smoothly and you wind up below your estimated hours you can always offer bonus work or bill your client a lower amount both will make for very happy customers3 start writing your business proposal now it’s time to dive into the actual proposal document proposals tend to follow a loose formula they start with an intro that summarizes your business and the project followed by a body that fleshes out all the detail including a pricing table photos and charts  and a conclusion that tells the customer how to proceed delving into this part of your proposal can certainly take a while if your time is precious you can always hire a writer from fiverr to flesh out your proposal or just give it a final polish they start offering their services at just 5– click here to see your options visit fiverr next we’ll describe each step with more detail section 1 introduction start by introducing your company and mission in a way that relates to your potential client’s needs you can include a brief story that gives your client a feel for you brand’s character and helps build trust highlight what distinguishes your company your accomplishments credentials and any awards the length of your intro should be a matter of common sense if you’re proposing a oneday carpet cleaning job don’t spend more than few sentences describing your business if your contract is poised to last several years however you’ll probably need to spend a lot more time describing your core business values nonetheless try to always keep it under 1 page section 2 executive summary the executive summary is one of the most important sections in your proposal this is where you should present the case for why you are the right company for the job and give the reader the takeaway message of the proposal you should not try to summarize every aspect of the proposal but rather focus on the conclusions you want the reader to reach after reading it use direct factual language that is objective and persuasive this section should be also be kept under 1 page section 3 table of contents optionala table of contents can be helpful for longer proposals with lots of details list each section and subsection with their corresponding page number in general we recommend keeping your proposal as short as possible so most proposals shouldn’t need this extra section section 4 body once you have presented your overall case in the executive summary you can outline the specifics of your proposal this is where you can answer the “who what when where how and why” questions that you identified in step 2 include information on scheduling logistics and pricing you can use data charts to illustrate key concepts and can also include testimonials from past clients and a link to your website include your caveats the body is also where you include caveats or disclaimers about the type of work you can deliver as andy explained this is one of the most important parts of your business proposal – and one of the trickiest arts to master it’s a common tendency for clients to overextend knowingly or unknowingly their expectations of a provider for example let’s say you’re a business hired to setup internet and wi fi while on the job you’re also asked to set up their vo ip phones in the moment this doesn’t seem like a big deal – after all it’s just a matter of plugging ethernet cables into the phones weeks later however you start receiving calls about phones that aren’t working unintentionally you made yourself liable for a system that’s not even your specialty to avoid this type of responsibility you can write caveats – both about the type of work you offer and for your pricing example caveat an example of a caveat might be“ your company name will service all technical issues involving your specialties we reserve the right to charge extra in the of an issue that is not listed above”on the flipside you don’t want to include so many caveats that your client is scared away this is where the “art” of how to write a business proposal comes in include all necessary disclaimers but word them in a way that still shows the value you’ll bring to a business section 5 conclusion once you have outlined the details of your proposal reemphasize the exceptional results your company can provide you should conclude with a call to action that encourages the reader to contact you or visit your website for more information ideally you want your client to take an immediate action even if it is something small section 6 appendix the appendix is an optional section that you can use to include information that might not fit well in the body of your proposal for example you can include resumes or additional graphs projections and customer testimonials should i set a deadline generally no unless there’s an actual time limitation a deadline is just an arbitrary statement all it does is put pressure on your client to sign the deal quickly while this was a common sales strategy in the past many small business owners have veered away from this philosophy today as andy explained to us deadlines aren’t a great trustbuilder they reveal your focus is on the contract itself – not on the client’s needs and longterm well being the only time you should use a deadline is when your resources are limited depending on the time frame for example material costs price of goods like electronics raw materials and even some foods  lobster anyone can fluctuate from one week to the next if your pricing is timesensitive make note of this in the proposal resource availability your office has a major project starting next month you can pick up a smaller project beforehand but only if you start immediately in a scenario like this just explain your situation so your client understands why they need to make a fast decision pro tip use custom fields in your crm to save important details as you write your proposal you’ll likely keep referring back to old emails and notes to find the “ who what where when and hows ” as we mentioned before a crm is a great place to store these important tidbits of information in particular custom fields remind you and your employees to collect this information and make it easily accessible later on for example a web design business might collect following information note the custom fields i have saved in the left column— preferred host domain name etc these automatically appear on my proposal’s “opportunity” page in insightly from the same menu i can also viewadd notes emails attached documents relevant contact information and more4 edit your business proposal first and foremost proofread whenever possible send it to somebody else to read over a second set of eyes can catch errors you may not notice you can hire an editor from fiverr for as little as 5 depending on the length of the proposal and their skill level click here to get started visit fiverr secondly you need to pay attention to the tone and length of your proposal in particular make sure your proposal is short enough to read in a single sitting and contains language that is professional yet clear how long should the proposal be you want your proposal to be as short as possible without missing any key information as andy explained to us this is for a very simple reason so your client doesn’t pass it onto somebody else if your recipient can’t read and digest your proposal in a single sitting about 8 minutes chances are it will go back on their todo pile or get forwarded to another employee best case this prolongs the sales process worst case it pulls you out of the running what can i do to make my proposal shorter any superfluous information like testimonials graphs and charts can be moved to the appendix as far as the text itself keep an eye out for repetition rather than emphasize your value proposition again and again find a single example that drives your point home “how much do we care about our customers our phone line is open 247 and we respond to all emails within 30 minutes or less”the tone and language you should use make sure you use clear concise and simple language that avoids industry jargon and technical terms at the same time avoid using hyperbole that exaggerates your company or service  “our groundbreaking product quadruples sales”  as this may undermine the trust you are trying to establish with your potential client for his proposals at science retail andy’s solution is a balance of “keeping it real  keeping the basic formalities of a business proposal” in other words use the same casualmeetsformal tone you would use in their office during a meeting there is one exception even if you’ve cracked jokes with your potential client keep humor out of your proposal as andy explained this is because you never know who is reading the proposal often it gets passed from a business owner to other employees spouses and even friends a joke that lands well with your client may fall flat with somebody else5 send out your business proposal  follow up if you’ve written a proposal before you know the work is hardly over after you click “send” following up with a client to give them a reminder and to answer questions is a key part of the proposal process since most businesses send their proposals via email it’s fairly easy to decide when to follow up here’s how using email tracking software you can receive a notification when the recipient opens your message follow up the next morning to see if they have any questions email tracking is offered by a number of different programs – including insightly crm simply login to insightly and head to “contacts” find your potential customer and click on their email address write your message either from scratch or using an email template attach
