2016 · author has 222k answers and 281m answer views originally answered should car tires be replaced when they reach a certain age its hard to predict the life of tires that still have lots of tread left the reason is that the age of the tires may not be obvious  they may have set on the shelf at the dealer or wholesaler for a couple of years beefore being sold to you are new the other factor is that you may keep the car in the shade or it may be outside 100 of the time exposing it to lots of degrading uv in which case the damage is also dependent upon your latititude also ozone and hot and cold weather can accelerate breakdown of the rubber i would use the general rule of thumb that if you start to see microcracks appearing in the grooves and sidewalls of your tire then you should consider replacing them they can obviously go on for a long time with microcracks and its hard to know how deep they go but the potential is there to allow the steel belts within to rust and eventually the tire can separate usually at a really bad time  like under stress due to high heat from driving fast and long distances if you use it for short runs and slow speed grocery shopping id be less concerned as a blowout or failure would be less critical unless of course your wife and children are riding in the car anyway you should get at least 4 years from tires before seeing these microcracks keep an eye out for thishttpwwwtirerackcomtiresti btw tires are datecoded for year and week of manufacture a tire with a dot code of 1109 was made in the 11th week of 2009 tires with a threedigit code were made prior to 2000 and are trickier to decode the first two digits still tell you the week but the third digit tells you the year in the decade that it was created the hard part

mercedesbenz tell consumers to replace tires six years after their production date regardless of tread life tire manufacturers such as continental and michelin say a tire can last up to 10 years provided you get annual tire inspections after the fifth year most tires are considered to have a life of between 25000 and 50000 miles before they need to be replaced however these numbers are only averages a car owners manual can include specific recommendations regarding how often and in what manner tires should be replaced for a particular model of car aside from taking your tire to a professional the above procedure shouldnt take more than 15 to 30 minutes to change a tire just be sure you dont leave out any steps its beneficial practice changing a tire in your garage or driveway

answer views originally answered should car tires be replaced when they reach a certain age thats a very personal decision and the amount you drive makes a great deal of difference the rubber used in car tires like all rubber does degrade slowly with time and exposure to ozone and sunlightskylight or any other source of uv drying out cracking eventually exposing the structural belts and potentially the tires inner rubber surface which when it cracks blows air like crazy most people never have to think about it because they wear out their tires faster than the tires degrade resulting in waste piles like this some of us though dont drive nearly so far each year and so can wind up with some pretty old tires if you like me dont mind getting a flat tire once in a long while you may choose to drive them until they leak i have a set of tires one one truck which may have been originally installed and inflated in 1968 the year that truck was built the truck after all only has 13000 original miles on the odometer and almost certainly has not worn through one set of tires yet but if you are securityoriented and cannot tolerate ever having to change a tire on the road then you should probably get rid of responsibly i hope your tires when they get to be about seven to ten years old after about five years start inspecting them periodically looking for tiny cracks weather checks in the rubber these cracks dont need to be very big to expose the structural belts which if steel can start rusting immediately when you find them start getting itchy about replacing the tires if youre a highly responsible person you may even slash the tires sidewalls before they go to help ensure that nobody will ever scavenge them and try to use them for lifecritical vehicles12k views ·

depends on a few factors actually 1 what sort of tires you have this doesnt just come down to brand or construction quality its about the type of tires on your car most dailydriver passenger cars have tires which under mixed city and highway driving conditions should be good for 40000 milesdepending on the tire a crappy offbrand tire will almost always last a shorter amount of time than a michelincontinentaldunlopyokohamapirelli etc sports or even just sporty car tires tend to last for fewer miles than thata lot fewer depending on how you drive the car and again depending on the quality of the tires themselves those can last between 20000 and 30000 miles the tradeoff there in case you were wondering is that these sport tires while they may last a lot fewer miles and often have a harsher noisier ride provide massively more grip in highspeed cornering situations snow tires especially if you drive them through the warm months for some reason are a little more unpredictable ultimately i would expect them to last about as long as other tires in the same sizing bracket maybe a little less 2 how you drive if youre blasting around corners at half the speed of sound on a regular basis or if your cartruck routinely handles very heavy loads over long distances then youll want to make sure that your tires are replaced a little earlier than is strictlyspeaking necessary why because tires wear unevenly and if you get into a situation where your tires only have 3mm of tread left and you go into a corner and burn off 3mmyoure getting a blowout worse a highspeed blowout moral of the story if youre a hooner or a hauler replace your tires just a little bit early 3 how your tires feel on the road if youre not tracking straight that is if you go over a bump or a nasty pavement seam and all of a sudden your wheel starts shimmying it might be a good time to get new tires basically if your tires feel wrong its worth investigating how much tread youve got theres actually a good ruleofthumb for investigating how much tread you have at home takes about two seconds and it only costs one cent actually its free but you need to have a penny for it too many people drive around with wornout bald tires check the tread with the penny test put a penny into the tread with abes head down if you cant see the hair on his head your tires are fine if his whole head is showing get new tires pronto source httpjalopnikcom5901372ten thats about it for my advice but above all if you think your tires might need replacing take your car to a tire shop and ask them if they agree if they tell you your tires do need replacing ask them to show you exactly why and ask them to tell you how much tread they think would be acceptable on a tire of the size you have ultimately all you have to lose from that experience is timein my experience since the advent of tire rackcom tire shop staff have spontaneously gotten a lot nicer 16k views · view upvoters nisha

car could mean the difference between driving safely or experiencing a catastrophic accident knowing when to change them is a vital part of proper maintenance one easy way is to check by a visual inspection of the wear bars the factory has placed in the middle of the tire tread these bars which run perpendicular to the tread are barely visible when tires are new but as you pack on the miles the wear bars become more visible and once they are level to the tire tread its time to get new tires another easy method is to grab a penny turn it upside down and stick it into the tread to measure its depth if the presidents head is covered up by the tread then your tires are fine but if the presidents head is visible then your tires are too worn and need changing435 views · view upvoters jim
