kids preschool how to tame sibling rivalry one exasperated mom test drives strategies for dealing with sibling rivalry by diane peters  oct 11 2010illustration credit laura perez good luck to me every time i nip downstairs to check on the laundry or dash upstairs to check my email within seconds my absence is followed by a sirenlike wail that would be my threeyearold daughter she’s perfected this shriek just as her sixyearold brother has honed his smacks and other torments yup my two kids fight it began in the early weeks of young hazel’s life when the grandparents had retreated my husband got busy with work and i was left alone most days to care for the kids i’d feed hazel while leo would stand beside my chair and scream it’s never gotten better i often tell other parents about my kids’ ongoing conflicts and i get looks of concerned shock “really my eldest just loves the baby they never fight”but experts reassure me that those parents may be sugarcoating the truth “this issue is a common one” says jacqueline green a parenting educator in edson alta adele faber an american parenting educator and the coauthor of siblings without rivalry adds that members of the same family have been fighting through history “just open up a bible see what cain did to abel see what joseph’s brothers did to him sibling rivalry is an old misery”but there may be a good side to the rows “i think that siblings give children one of their first opportunities to try some of the skills they’re going to need with their coworkers with their spouses with everyone as they age” says green that is if they can turn their nasty fights into calm conflicts they can resolve my quest is to help my kids do that so i spoke to experts and test drove some strategies for preventing and calming conflict read

good idea to try to turn down the heat strategy give them attention green thinks carving out oneonone time can prevent many sibling conflicts she suggests that you nab 15 minutes’ uninterrupted time a day per child use a timer if you have to for an activity of his choosing kids need space too not just time says ellen mortlock parent education coordinator for the peterborough ont family resource centre allotting each child a corner of a bedroom or a basket of sacred toys may lessen the stress of sharing a house verdict in my nutty household with my husband working long hours oneonone time is impossible on a daily basis and the last time i took my son to a movie he was so scared by the film he declared the date “didn’t count” instead my son and i are getting creative we hold hands on the way to school whenever my daughter’s not with us which means no stroller my kids don’t seem to need private space for their toys just yet but i like the idea of getting them separate special bins for their treasures strategy never compare when we say things like “your brother finished his dinner and cleared his plate — why can’t you” we inadvertently set siblings up to resent each other “cut out the comparisons even the favourable ones” says faber the kid with the complimented table manners is also aware he’s in a contest and may feel the pressure to stay perfect when your child complains of unfair treatment skip the debate and simply ask him what he wants a special outing oneonone storytime meanwhile forget promising your kids you’ll treat them exactly equal it’s impossible “tell them ‘you’ll get what you need when you need it it’s not going to be equal across the board’” says judy arnall a calgary parenting educator and the author of discipline without distress verdict focusing on needs not comparisons worked for me one time my son asked for a longer hug after complaining of unfairness another day he told me he wanted more comfort after scrapes and spills like i give his more sensitive sister strategy family meetings some conflicts can drag on particularly with older kids who share clothes friends bathrooms and computers regular meetings help everyone feel they have a voice and lead to things like household rules being posted on the fridge “kids can enjoy contributing and the experience can have such a lasting effect on them” says faber verdict as i was growing up family meetings were never pleasant so we’ve only done this a few times with our young clan for now talking out problems in the moment is working for us i think i’ll try meetings again when the kids are older when everyone has input they’re all bound to get along better wading into battle sometimes all your peacemaking evaporates in the heat of a struggle for the remote here’s what to do strategy go in calm faber says it’s so tempting to shout out “stop it you two” when there’s a fight going on resist “it’s like saying to niagara falls ‘stop it’” she suggests affirming what you are witnessing “boy you two seem so angry at each other” and then listen if an argument is minor and your kids have learned some negotiating skills you can stay out of it unless things get rough or out of control and if they are already in full swing before playing referee green suggests remind yourself that getting along is hard for kids and they’re not fighting merely to annoy you “start with the end in mind” she says enter the fight having a plan for calming the kids and helping them find a solution pull kids apart if they’re about to come to blows separate them by a few feet or even a room if needed and have them count to 10 or watch a quick video or listen to a song once all is chilled out you can implement some of the other strategies in this article to work out the problem verdict having thought about sibling rivalry so much of late i understand better how tough it is to get along that’s helping me stay focused and relaxed “everyone seems very upset in here” has become a favourite line but when we’re late for school or something’s burning on the stove — or that time my son got utterly hysterical and would not chill no matter what i did — i personally prefer a trusty “quit it you two”strategy focus on the “victim” since many sibling conflicts are about drawing attention experts suggest making a fuss over the injured victim punishing a hitter with a long lecture and a time out actually gives him what he wants attention also green says punishing an aggressor automatically can mean you don’t get the backstory — the other sibling may have provoked the attack verdict since i was beginning to suspect my daughter was setting up my son to strike coddling her injuries didn’t work it rewards her sneaky behaviour plus if i dwell on her it fuels leo’s fear that i favour hazel but i’m happy to nix the time outs and lectures that gives us all more time and energy to get to the root of what’s going on strategy get at the feelings too often we focus on the fight and not the emotions that caused it “feelings that are banished don’t vanish they come out in the next fight” says faber she suggests letting both children tell you their side of the conflict and express their feelings one at a time without interrupting each other listen without judgment and repeat back each child’s viewpoint for kids who have trouble describing what they feel particularly young ones arnall uses a technique called mirroring she talks to kids about how awful it must feel to argue and how frustrated they must feel over both wanting the same toy she suggests the feeling and they agree or disagree if they disagree suggest a different feeling until you get it right getting empathy for what they’re going through works quickly on kids “it’s really powerful it does something literally in our brains to calm us down” says arnall verdict my kids were amazingly insightful through this technique and i heard some very elaborate backstories the backandforthing gets confusing but i just let them keep talking in turn until they’re done after lots of chatting i found my kids were able to let go of petty problems my son also began talking about his real feelings and in private told me “i wish you’d never borned her” we hugged and he was playing happily with his sister five minutes later but this process takes plenty of time and we’ve had a few cold and burnt dinners as a result strategy let them figure it out we parents usually step into an argument and decree from on high who gets to choose the movie or on what terms the borrowed article of clothing gets returned but once kids are calm and have told their side of the tale you can tell them it’s now time to figure out the solution on their own younger children might need suggestions arnall says but the final decision should fall to them “let them decide if they’re going to say no” when encouraging kids to share or yield a turn she says “when you do that they’re more likely to say yes”verdict my duelling duo is able to negotiate quite well once when they couldn’t decide who was wrong or right they agreed to both say sorry at the exact same time now when they wake up on saturday mornings they immediately start bargaining for their choice in cartoon channels strategy pull out some mediation tricks for minor tussles over sharing a toy or divvying up the last of the banana bread or when kids can’t work out a solution on their own see above arnall suggests using some sharing techniques that feel fair toss a coin to make a decision have the person who goes first take a shorter turn let one kid divide the precious object and the other choose her piece children should ok the fairness trick before you use it and get to pick heads or tails on their own “let them see the process you want them to work it out with you” says arnall verdict i used arnall’s idea of “get it first or get it longer” to deal with a coveted comic book one got it until lunchtime the other had it the rest of the day by then the book was forgotten of course these tricks are great when you don’t have a lot of time or when kids just can’t hash out a solution without help if you use them enough older kids should remember these techniques and use them on their own why kids fight siblings don’t bicker or duke it out because they despise one another you hope most of the time the rivalries have underlying causes including boredom and stress feeling yucky take a swing at your brother that’s why hungry bored children often have tiffs in the back seat of the car and why those having a rough time at school pick a fight when they get home “under stress kids will take it out on an easy target” says calgary parenting educator judy arnall wanting attention kids need to know their parents care and they often measure that via attention this is particularly true for older siblings who remember life without a little brother or sister “it starts with fear fear of losing what up until now has been yours alone all the hugs and attention all the love” says faber inequality “kids have a really good sense of fairness” says arnall if they sense they’re not being treated equitably resentment can grow and with it conflict circumstances birth order age gap gender and personality play a huge role in how much siblings fight for example “some boys are naturally more competitive and see a younger sibling as a threat rather than someone they can nurture and learn from” says parenting educator jacqueline green meanwhile issues such as one child having a medical problem or special needs or events in the family like death or divorce can impact sibling relationships and cause resentment blame or stress
