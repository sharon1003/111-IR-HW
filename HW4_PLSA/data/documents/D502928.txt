of 25 garrison joined the antislavery movement later crediting the 1826 book of presbyterian reverend john rankin letters on slavery for attracting him to the cause 3 for a brief time he became associated with the american colonization society an organization that promoted the resettlement of free blacks to a territory now known as liberia on the west coast of africa although some members of the society encouraged granting freedom to slaves others considered relocation a means to reduce the number of already free blacks in the united states southern members thought reducing the threat of free blacks in society would help preserve the institution of slavery by late 1829–1830 garrison rejected colonization publicly apologized for his error and then as was typical of him he censured all who were committed to it 4genius of universal emancipation garrison began writing for and became coeditor with benjamin lundy of the quaker newspaper genius of universal emancipation in baltimore maryland with his experience as a printer and newspaper editor garrison changed the layout of the paper and handled other operation issues lundy was freed to spend more time touring as an antislavery speaker garrison initially shared lundys gradualist views but while working for the genius he became convinced of the need to demand immediate and complete emancipation lundy and garrison continued to work together on the paper in spite of their differing views each signed his own editorials garrison introduced the black list a column devoted to printing short reports of the barbarities of slavery—kidnappings whippings murders 5 for instance garrison reported that francis todd a shipper from garrisons home town of newburyport massachusetts was involved in the domestic slave trade and that he had recently had slaves shipped from baltimore to new orleans in the coastwise trade on his ship the francis this was thoroughly legal although the us had in 1807 prohibited the international slave trade from africa todd filed a suit for libel in maryland against both garrison and lundy he thought to gain support from proslavery courts the state of maryland also brought criminal charges against garrison quickly finding him guilty and ordering him to pay a fine of 50 and court costs charges against lundy were dropped on the grounds that he had been traveling when the story was printed garrison refused to pay the fine and was sentenced to a jail term of six months 6 he was released after seven weeks when the antislavery philanthropist arthur tappan donated the money for the fine garrison decided to leave baltimore and he and lundy amicably agreed to part ways the liberator in 1831 garrison returned to new england where he cofounded a weekly antislavery newspaper the liberator with his friend isaac knapp 7 in the first issue garrison stated i am aware that many object to the severity of my language but is there not cause for severity i will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice on this subject i do not wish to think or speak or write with moderation no no tell a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands of the ravisher tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen—but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present i am in earnest—i will not equivocate—i will not excuse—i will not retreat a single inch— and i will be heard the apathy of the people is enough to make every statue leap from its pedestal and to hasten the resurrection of the dead 8paid subscription to the liberator was always smaller than its circulation in 1834 it had two thousand subscribers threefourths of whom were blacks benefactors paid to have the newspaper distributed to influential statesmen and public officials although garrison rejected physical force as a means for ending slavery his critics took his demand for immediate emancipation literally some believed he advocated the sudden and total freeing of all slaves and considered him a dangerous fanatic nat turner s slave rebellion in virginia just seven months after the liberator started publication fueled the outcry against garrison in the south a north carolina grand jury indicted him for distributing incendiary material and the georgia legislature offered a 5000 reward for his capture and conveyance to the state for trial among the antislavery essays and poems which garrison published in the liberator was an article in 1856 by a 14yearold anna dickinson the liberator gradually gained a large following in the northern states by 1861 it had subscribers across the north as well as in england scotland and canada it was received in state legislatures governors mansions congress and the white house after the end of the civil war and the abolition of slavery by the thirteenth amendment garrison published the last issue number 1820 on december 29 1865 writing a valedictory column after reviewing his long career in journalism and the cause of abolitionism he wrote the object for which the liberator was commenced—the extermination of chattel slavery—having been gloriously consummated it seems to me specially appropriate to let its existence cover the historic period of the great struggle leaving what remains to be done to complete the work of emancipation to other instrumentalities of which i hope to avail myself under new auspices with more abundant means and with millions instead of hundreds for allies 9portrait of garrisons wife helen eliza benson organization and reaction in addition to publishing the liberator garrison spearheaded the organization of a new movement to demand the total abolition of slavery in the united states by january 1832 he had attracted enough followers to organize the newengland antislavery society which by the following summer had dozens of affiliates and several thousand members in december 1833 abolitionists from ten states founded the american antislavery society aas although the new england society reorganized in 1835 as the massachusetts antislavery society enabling state societies to form in the other new england states it remained the hub of antislavery agitation throughout the antebellum period many affiliates were organized by women who responded to garrisons appeals for women to take active part in the abolition movement the largest of these was the boston female antislavery society which raised funds to support the liberator publish antislavery pamphlets and conduct antislavery petition drives the purpose of the american antislavery society was the conversion of all americans to the philosophy that slaveholding is a heinous crime in the sight of god and that duty safety and best interests of all concerned require its immediate abandonment without expatriation 10meanwhile on september 4 1834 garrison married helen eliza benson 1811–1876 the daughter of a retired abolitionist merchant the couple had five sons and two daughters of whom a son and a daughter died as children william lloyd garrison engraving from 1879 newspaper the threat posed by antislavery organizations and their activity drew violent reaction from slave interests in both the southern and northern states with mobs breaking up antislavery meetings assaulting lecturers ransacking antislavery offices burning postal sacks of antislavery pamphlets and destroying antislavery presses healthy bounties were offered in southern states for the capture of garrison dead or alive 11on october 21 1835 a mob of several thousand surrounded the building housing bostons antislavery offices where garrison had agreed to address a meeting of the boston female antislavery society after the fiery british abolitionist george thompson was unable to keep his engagement with them mayor theodore lyman persuaded the women to leave the building but when the mob learned that thompson was not within they began yelling for garrison lyman was a staunch antiabolitionist but nonetheless wanted to avoid bloodshed and suggested garrison escape by a back window while lyman told the crowd garrison was gone 12 the mob spotted and apprehended garrison tied a rope around his waist and pulled him through the streets towards boston common calling for tar and feathers the mayor intervened and had garrison arrested and rushed off to the leverett street jail for his own protection the woman question and division anne whitney william lloyd garrison 1879 massachusetts historical society garrisons appeal for womens mass petitioning against slavery sparked a controversy over womens right to a political voice in 1837 women abolitionists from seven states convened in new york to expand their petitioning efforts and repudiate the social mores that proscribed their participation in public affairs that summer sisters angelina grimké and sarah grimké responded to the controversy roused by their public speaking with treatises on womans rights – angelinas letters to catherine e beecher 13 and sarahs letters on the equality of the sexes and condition of woman 14 – and garrison published them first in the liberator and then in book form instead of surrendering to appeals for him to retreat on the woman question garrison announced in december 1837 that the liberator would support the rights of woman to their utmost extent the massachusetts antislavery society appointed women to leadership positions and hired abby kelley as the first of several female field agents in 1840 garrisons promotion of womans rights within the antislavery movement was one of the issues that caused some abolitionists including new york brothers arthur tappan and lewis tappan to leave the aas and form the american and foreign antislavery society which did not admit women in june of that same year when the world antislavery convention meeting in london refused to seat americas women delegates garrison charles lenox remond nathaniel p rogers and william adams 15 refused to take their seat as delegates as well and joined the women in the spectators gallery the controversy introduced the womans rights question not only to england but also to future womans rights leader elizabeth cady stanton who attended the convention as a spectator accompanying her delegatehusband henry b stanton although henry stanton had cooperated in the tappans failed attempt to wrest leadership of the aas from garrison he was part of another group of abolitionists unhappy with garrisons influence—those who disagreed with garrisons insistence that because the u s constitution was a proslavery document abolitionists should not participate in politics and government a growing number of abolitionists—including stanton gerrit smith charles turner torrey and amos a phelps —wanted to form an antislavery political party and seek a political solution to slavery they withdrew from the aas in 1840 formed the liberty party and nominated james g birney for president by the end of 1840 garrison announced the formation of a third new organization the friends of universal reform with sponsors and founding members including prominent reformers maria chapman abby kelley foster oliver johnson and amos bronson alcott father of louisa may alcott   citation neededalthough some members

time washington goode a black seaman had been sentenced to death for the murder of a fellow black mariner thomas harding in the liberator garrison argued that the verdict relied on circumstantial evidence of the most flimsy character  and feared that the determination of the government to uphold its decision to execute goode was based on race as all other death sentences since 1836 in boston had been commuted garrison concluded that goode would be the last person executed in boston for a capital offense writing let it not be said that the last man massachusetts bore to hang was a colored man despite the efforts of garrison and many other prominent figures of the time goode was hanged on may 25 1849  citation neededgarrison became famous as one of the most articulate as well as most

eve of the civil war a sermon preached in a universalist chapel in brooklyn new york denounced the blood thirsty sentiments of garrison and his school and did not wonder that the feeling of the south was exasperated taking as they did the insane and bloody ravings of the garrisonian traitors for the fairly expressed opinions of the north 20photograph of garrison after abolition after the united states abolished slavery garrison announced in may 1865 that he would resign the presidency of the american antislavery society and offered a resolution declaring victory in the struggle against slavery and dissolving the society the resolution prompted sharp debate however led by his longtime friend wendell phillips who argued that the mission of the aas was not fully completed until black southerners gained full political and civil equality garrison maintained that while complete civil equality was vitally important the special task of the aas was at an end and that the new task would best be handled by new organizations and new leadership with his longtime allies deeply divided however he was unable to muster the support he needed to carry the resolution and it was defeated 118–48
