look for when purchasing tocotrienol10 what was the source of the tocotrienol used in most clinical studies1 what is tocotrienol tocotrienols are part of the vitamin e family tocotrienols have a similar structure to tocopherols but contain three double bonds in the carbon side chain of the molecule the vitamin e family is comprised of eight different isomers  alpha beta gamma and delta tocotrienol and tocopherol2 where does tocotrienol come from tocotrienol is naturally found in the seeds and fruits of some botanicals they are found at high concentration in palm oil other sources are rice wheat germ oat and barley3 is tocotrienol safe yes and it has fda selfaffirmed gras status  toxicological and pharmacological studies showed that supplementation with palm based tocotrienols up to 2500mg per day per kilogram of body weight did not produce any side effects in addition tocotrienol is a natural compound found in various foods and oils such as palm olein rice bran oil wheat germ barley etc one may be taking tocotrienol through these common foods without even realizing it4 how is tocotrienol absorbed in the body tocotrienol is lipophilic or fat soluble it is absorbed through the gi tract as other lipidsoluble vitamins a d and k and phytonutrients like carotenoids the absorption of these compounds is dependent on the physiological processes of the stomach and small intestine especially fat intake5 what is the regulatory status of tocotrienol tocotrienol has been approved for use in dietary supplement in australia japan malaysia hong kong singapore canada and the united states due to the recent research work with tocotrienols and that scientific evidence supporting the health benefits of tocotrienols the fda has assigned tocotrienols as selfaffirmed gras oct 20096 is there a rda for tocotrienols at the moment there is no rda for tocotrienols it was only in the early 1980s that research scientist all over the world started to investigate this new vitamin e as the scientific evidence of tocotrienols is relatively new the us fda and us pharmacopeia have not assigned vitamin e activity to tocotrienols all the human and animal studies have been based on milligram of pure tocotrienols per day basis for human studies the highest tested dose is 500mg60kg adult for those people who want to maintain a healthy level of cholesterol and breastprostate health the consensus among tocotrienol research scientists was a dosage of 50100mgday7 which of the proven health benefits were carried out clinically on human the various human studies and dosage used in these studies specifically for a therapeutic condition are 1 since the early 1990s there were hints that antioxidants could have some effect in showing regression of arteriosclerosis improvement of artery health and blood flow dr anthony verlangieri of the atherosclerosis laboratory at the university of mississippi published his research in reversing atherosclerosis in monkeys with antioxidant nutrients a report in jama in 1995 showed that antioxidant vitamins slowed progression of coronary atherosclerosis in a threeyear doubleblind clinical study at the kenneth jordan heart foundation new jersey on 50 patients with carotid stenosis blockage of the carotid artery the main artery that supplies blood to the brain patients were given a supplementation of 240mg palm tocotrienol complex per day within 6 months 92 of the patients had an improvement in their blood flow through the carotid artery indicating the ability of palm tocotrienol complex to reverse artery blockage and improve artery health 2 palm tocotrienol complex has been proven by numerous human and animal studies to have the ability to inhibit cholesterol production in the liver tocotrienols are potent and effective natural antioxidant nutrients to have the ability to inhibit the key enzyme that is responsible for cholesterol production in the body hmg co a reductase in human cholesterol lowering human studies mild hypercholesterolemia patients were given a supplementation of 200mg palm based tocotrienols per day significant reduction of total serum cholesterol was observed within 6 to 8 weeks the reduction of total serum cholesterol was between 1533 whereas the hdl level was no affected in another crossover human study carried out at the science university of malaysia randomly picked subjects with uncontrolled diet was given supplementation of 100mg palm tocotrienols per day within 8 to 10 weeks there was a significant reduction of 1012 of total cholesterol level in the group that received tocotrienols 3 there are four reputable research centers that are currently furthering their research on the ability of palm tocotrienol complex to inhibit both the estrogen positive and negative human breast cancer cells the research centers are university of reading uk university of louisiana university of western ontario and malaysian palm oil board mpob at the moment research is focused on elucidating the mechanism of inhibition of breast cancer cells by tocotrienols in addition the university of wisconsin is currently carrying out studies on the inhibitory effect of tocotrienols on hepatocarcinogenesis8 what proven benefits do tocotrienols have on prevention of skin agingdamage by ultraviolet uv the idea of using tocotrienols in cosmetic and personal care products is recent being a more potent vitamin e research scientists especially at the university of california berkeley have started to investigate the additional benefits of tocotrienols over the alpha tocopherol vitamin e in the prevention of skin agingdamage studies performed in usa and japan showed that dietderived or topically applied tocotrienols preferentially accumulate at the stratum corneum to defend against free radicals generated by exposure to environment agents such as sun ray uv9 what should i look for when purchasing tocotrienols look for a natural palm derived tocotrienol complex product if minimally processed it should also contain the other phytonutrients found naturally in palm oil these include phytosterols squalene and mixed carotenoids thus offering a “platter” of a natural and wholesome phytonutrient complex other ricederived tocotrienols are also available in the market10 what was the source of the tocotrienol used in most clinical studies majority of the invitro animal human studies published so far on the health benefits of tocotrienols was carried out with palm tocotrienol complex palm tocotrienol complex has very different chemistry and contents from rice based tocotrienols the ratio of tocotrienols to tocopherol in palm tocotrienol complex is very much higher at 25to 10 in rice base tocotrienols it is approximately 10 to 10
