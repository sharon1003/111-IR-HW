washing my hair is not a priority when it comes to the best shampoo for me well it’s whatever happens to be in my shower which is usually my husband’s head  shoulders i have a really short pixie ‘do so my hair routine is pretty lowmaintenance but when it comes to my kids it’s another story my daughter and son are typical children — rambunctious playful and as a result dirty just the sight of bubbles gets them excited  until i pull out the shampoo bottle my daughter generally acquiesces without much of a fight but my son could enter the bantamweight challenge he hates having his hair washed so when i read one blogger’s account on how she stopped shampooing and conditioning i was intrigued mari hernandeztuten told babblecom that her hair routine is “no shampoo and no conditioner you wash your hair with baking soda and vinegar that’s it”hernandeztuten goes on to explain that she has eschewed traditional shampoo and conditioner for vanity purposes she’s trying to get her shiny locks back and that storebought detergents strip hair of its natural oils causing your scalp to produce even more oil until you’re lathering up every day to avoid the dreaded “greaser” look the “nopoo” movement is nothing new back in march of 2011 w magazine editor christa d’souza documented her shampoofree journey apparently jessica simpson and prince harry joined the movement too and one of our own staffers has even been known to go a few weeks between washing while i’m all about limiting the chemicals that my family comes into contact with the process that hernandeztuten describes would be less pleasant than my son’s antishampoo tantrums it involves creating a paste of baking soda and water massaging it into your scalp and hair and then conditioning it with — wait for it — apple cider vinegar i love the idea of a diy shampoo that’s chemicalfree but i can only imagine the resistance i’d get from my kids as i tried to woo them to the kitchen sink for their evening wash the smell alone would inspire the most epic tantrums and i can’t even begin to wonder what i’d have to use to bribe them mms for dinner for now i’m going to stick to johnson  johnson and continue to hope for “no more tears”think it can’t get any stranger than that think again here’s our roundup of the eight latest and strangest hollywood beauty secrets photo gallerybizarre hollywood beauty secrets xwant more huff post style beauty content check us out on twitter facebook tumblr pinterest and instagram at huff post beauty for everything else check out our main huff post style twitter tumblr pinterest and instagram huff post style — do you have a beauty story idea or tip email us at beautytipshuffingtonpostcom pr pitches sent to this address will be ignored
