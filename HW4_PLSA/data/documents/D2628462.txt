idea that they could do that yes sailors used to have salt crusted boots but it would have been soiled by foot they wanted the good stuff that is why when people discovered the silk road in china it got so much business because they realized they could trade for salt hope this helpssource s7th grade historyhello · 1 decade ago0 0 comment ive never heard of sailors being paid in salt but in
