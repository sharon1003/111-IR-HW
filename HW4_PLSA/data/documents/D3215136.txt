expressions of type date are cast to timestamp and can therefore be used as well field is an identifier or string that selects what field to extract from the source value the extract function returns values of type double precision  the following are valid field namescentury the century select extract century from timestamp 20001216 122113 result 20 select extract century from timestamp 20010216

number of the week of the year that the day is in by definition  iso 8601 weeks start on mondays and the first week of a year contains january 4 of that year in other words the first thursday of a year is in week 1 of that year in the iso definition it is possible for earlyjanuary dates to be part of the 52nd or 53rd week of the previous year and for latedecember dates to be part of the first week of the next year for example 20050101 is part of the 53rd week of year 2004 and 20060101 is part of the 52nd week of year 2005 while 20121231 is part of the first week of 2013 its recommended to use the isoyear field together with week to get consistent results select extract week from timestamp 20010216 203840 result 7year the year field keep in mind there is no 0 ad so subtracting bc years from ad years should be done with care select extract year from timestamp 20010216 203840 result 2001the extract function is primarily intended for computational processing for formatting datetime values for display see section 98 the datepart function is modeled on the traditional ingres equivalent to the sql standard function extractdatepart  field  source note that here the field parameter needs to be a string value not a name the valid field names for datepart are the same as for extract select datepart day timestamp 20010216 203840 result 16 select datepart hour interval 4 hours 3 minutes result 4
