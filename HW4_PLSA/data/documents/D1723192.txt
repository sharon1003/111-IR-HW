those chicks may be cute but they likely wont save you money at a safeway in southern california chicken egg prices range from 329 to 609 per dozen at the top end are cartons labelled organic and freerange suggesting happier hens better feed and ultimately better tasting and more nutritious eggs at the bottom end are cartons labelled large suggesting little more than big cheap eggs in california egg producers are now required to provide each hen a cage big enough to allow her to spread her wings – about twice as much room as the industry standard – which makes eggs destined for the california market 35 to 70 percent pricier than elsewhere ronald fong ceo of the california grocers association told npr outofstate producers have brought a lawsuit in federal court in an attempt to end this requirement – or at least not have it apply to them all of that is to note that one of the drivers of the recent boom in small backyard egg layers is humanitarian concern for hens in factory farms following a big salmonella outbreak in 2011 egg safety has become a concern too other factors include the trend toward locally produced foods a growing doityourself movement and the sheer novelty of raising three or six chickens at home but what about the cost a number of backyard egg advocates have crunched the numbers – and sadly this is not a moneysaving endeavor for most cost per dozen of backyard eggs ranges from about 3 for nonorganic freerange eggs to 6 and up for organic feed is by far the biggest expense but it takes money to start a backyard flock house it feed it provide it with fresh straw or wood chips for bedding and protect it from predators the average hens egg production peaks at one year and declines until she stops producing altogether at four or five years at that point the rancher can continue to house and feed the nonlaying hen recouping none of those costs via eggs or slaughter her for chicken soup unless the backyard rancher is capable of this thats another cost add it all up and theres no question about it grocery store eggs even the highpriced organic freerange variety cost less than home grown for all but the most efficient ranchers given that the economics do not favor the backyard flock here are a few reasons why people still do it backyard freerange eggshells are more colorful hens that forage for bugs and grubs grasses and clovers produce eggs in a variety of colors backyard hens reward their owners with white eggs brown eggs speckled eggs and even blue eggs every day is easter backyard eggs look and taste better because of the forage table scraps and generally high quality feed backyard ranchers offer their flocks the yolks are brighter in addition fresh eggs feature yolks that stand up better and whites that resist beating most aficionados claim backyard eggs taster better some testers agree while others – including researchers who work in the egg industry – do not backyard eggs are more nutritious according to a 2010 study by pennsylvannia state university’s college of agricultural sciences eggs from pastureraised or freerange hens have about half as much cholesterol as factoryproduced eggs twice as much vitamin e and omega3 fatty acids and 38 percent more vitamin a backyard hens live happier lives backyard hen husbandry is not without its cruelties few backyard ranchers desire roosters which means hatcheries have to rid themselves of unprofitable male chicks hens may meet violent ends due to predators or butchers nevertheless the life of a freetoroam backyard hen is far happier than that of a factory hen crammed into a narrow cage in a dark room backyard flocks teach lessons about agriculture and responsibility from farm economics to avian behavior a backyard flock has plenty to teach in addition to a strong work ethic children given the responsibility of raising hens have to learn to make decisions set goals and perhaps even experiment with different tools techniques and practices backyard flocks are entertaining most backyard egg ranchers describe their flocks as funny and entertaining to watch as they scratch and forage some even describe their hens as affectionate pets seen that way maybe its unfortunate that a cheerful flock also produces a commodity and must do so profitably after all few of us expect our pet dogs and cats to pay us back in anything other
