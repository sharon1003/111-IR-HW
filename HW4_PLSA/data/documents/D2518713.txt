where i should go to find this planet and i dont see any indication anywhere on the galaxy map of where i should go so what mass relay and system should i go to in order to find dekuunamasseffect3share improve this questionasked mar 19 12 at 2133murgatroid99147k 26 86 1411problem is if you already scanned dekuuna for the dekuuna code of the ancients quest you might have scanned oltan too and already picked up the elcor army without having the quest so just return to the quest giver and end the mission like gh0s t already said – user22025 mar 23 12 at 1313add a comment4 answers active oldest votesup vote15down voteaccepted the elcor homeworld of dekunna is in the silean nebula in the phontes system i see that youve found oltan  oltan is actually a satellite of dekuuna so it should be right there if you found the elcor asset there youre in the right place  the ships youre looking for are apparently on oltan actually its even possible you already found this one without realizing it maybemore at the mass effect wikishare improve this answeranswered mar 19 12 at 2150shinrai6333 10 37 74add a commentup vote8down vote the planet with the survivors youre looking is named oltan oltan is in the phontes system which in turn is in the silean nebula as for where dekuuna is its the big planet right next door to oltan once you scan oltan and pick up the elcor flotilla just head back to the citadel embassies and talk to the elcor ambassador again to finish the questshare improve this answeredited mar 19 12 at 2304answered mar 19 12 at 2141johnjon2625 11 31 67this is false when i go to that planet there is no option to land or scan i know i found an elcor asset there but that is not the same as this mission anyway the mission says that the planet is named dekuuna as my question says – murgatroid99 mar 19 12 at 21451true but you actually need to head to oltan not dekuuna regardless ive updated the answer – johnjon mar 19 12 at 2148ok i understand now i changed my vote – murgatroid99 mar 19 12 at 2153add a commentup vote3down vote dekuuna is located in the phontes system in the silean nebula but if you have already completed dekuuna code of the ancients nothing happens when you scan it it seems to be a bug in that case just speak to the quest giver to complete the missionshare improve this answeranswered mar 19 12 at 2153gh0s

moonshare improve this answeredited aug 7 12 at 2119dlanod6472 5 31 65answered aug 7 12 at 1011haydar ali13welcome to arqade thank you for contributing but your answer does not add anything to the
