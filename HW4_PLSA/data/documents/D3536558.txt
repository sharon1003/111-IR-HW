critical for adequate preoperative planning the lateral view of the pelvis or highangle oblique views can aid in visualizing the posterior column when hip hardware obscures the view on standard

keywordstotal hip arthroplasty revision pelvic discontinuity radiographacetabulum pelvic discontinuity is an uncommon and complex problem in hip revision surgery it is defined by a lack of bony continuity between the ilium superiorly and the ischium inferiorly most pelvic discontinuities appear to be unhealed transverse acetabular fractures that occur through areas of pelvic bone loss this loss of acetabular bone may be due to a previous operative procedure osteolysis from wear particles of cement or polyethylene infection fracture or mechanical failure of the prosthesis with subsequent migration and bony erosion 12 in the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons classification for acetabular bone loss pelvic discontinuity has a separate designation type iv 3 as the indications for total hip arthroplasty tha widen the number of revision procedures will increase along with the prevalence of pelvic discontinuity the preoperative identification of pelvic discontinuity is of critical importance to surgical planning and to ensure that the appropriate revision equipment is available in the operating room antiprotrusio cages plates for the posterior column large quantities of bone graft large uncemented cups structural metal wedges or custom triflange sockets are among the many specialized implants that may be required to treat pelvic discontinuity 1245 in most circumstances these implants are not kept in the hospital and special arrangements must be made to have the equipment available thus diagnosing a pelvic discontinuity preoperatively is of utmost importance although much has been written regarding surgical treatment of pelvic discontinuity there is little in the literature on how to identify pelvic discontinuity preoperatively identification of pelvic discontinuity can involve the use of standard plain radiographic views of the pelvis anteroposterior ap judet inlet and outlet views and computed tomography ct both techniques can be helpful in preoperatively diagnosing pelvic discontinuity but have their shortfalls plain radiographic signs of pelvic discontinuity are primarily indirect because hardware tends to block a direct view of the discontinuity if one sees a break in kohler line or asymmetry of the obturator foramens on a wellaligned ap view of the pelvis one will have a high degree of suspicion that pelvic discontinuity is present if there is minimal displacement of the fragments however these indirect signs of pelvic discontinuity may not be reliable for ct the metal hardware in the hip can cause substantial scatter of the image and may limit ones ability to view the bone of interest furthermore the primary slices for ct scans are usually in the plane of the discontinuity defect making it possible to miss the lesion ideally one would be able to directly visualize the defect on plain radiographs to make the diagnosis of pelvic discontinuity when hardware blocks direct visualization of the posterior column with standard judet views of the pelvis we have found that a lateral radiograph of the pelvis andor highangle oblique views 10°20° off of a lateral view of the pelvis can provide excellent visualization of the posterior column and aid in the diagnosis of pelvic discontinuity highangle oblique views can be helpful if the contralateral side of the pelvis obscures visualization of the posterior column of interest the xray film can be obtained in either the lateral decubitus position or the standing position in the lateral decubitus position  fig 1 a  the radiograph is obtained in nearly the same way as a lateral view of the sacrum the patient is positioned in the lateral decubitus position with the affected side down toward the xray cassette the xray beam is centered just posterior to the hip and directed down toward the cassette which is transversely across the patients pelvis alternately if the patient cannot tolerate lying on the side of interest the xray film can be taken in the standing position  fig 1 b with the patients affected side against the xray cassette the xray beam is again centered just posterior to the hip joint and directed horizontally toward the xray cassette which is transversely across the patients pelvis if the contralateral posterior column obscures the posterior column of interest the xray film can be taken 10° to 20° away from true lateral download highres

view of the pelvis can be taken in the standing position with the affected side toward the xray cassette we have used this radiographic view twice to evaluate a pelvis with a failed and medialized acetabular component and a question of pelvic discontinuity in both cases the acetabular component was in an excessively medialized position that blocked direct visualization of the posterior column on standard ap and judet views of the pelvis computed tomography was not helpful because of metal artifact on the lateral views of the pelvis the posterior column could be clearly visualized  figs 2 and 3  in fig 2 the posterior column is intact whereas in fig 3 the posterior column is not intact and the patient was found to have a pelvic discontinuity download highres image 227kb download

pelvis but the lateral view of the pelvis clearly demonstrates an intact posterior column download highres image 141kb download fullsize image fig 3 a lateral radiograph of the pelvis is shown in a patient with an excessively medialized acetabular component and pelvic discontinuity standard judet views of the pelvis failed to diagnose a pelvic discontinuity because of obstructing hardware and a ct scan failed to diagnose a pelvic discontinuity because of metal artifact this lateral view of the pelvis clearly shows discontinuity of the posterior column diagnosis of a pelvic discontinuity
