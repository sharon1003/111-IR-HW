how much does it cost to build a one car garage building a backyard wine cellar how deep should a houses sewer line be buried answered by brett  march 19 2012  no comments »  respond to this question the old sewer line from my house to the curb has collapsed and i want to replace it with new pvc because the pipe exits from my house only 6 inches below the ground surface i am worried about it freezing in the winter is this sewer line to shallow any suggestions forrest  colonial heights vaforrest although your homes existing sewer line might be susceptible to freezing due to the shallow depth at which it is now buried an equally important factor to consider is the slope at which the pipe angles down towards the curbside sewer main most properties dont have pumpdriven sewer and waste systems which means that gravity is solely responsible for keeping the pipes clean and your homes sewer waste moving in the right direction if the angle of a sewer pipe is too steep debris can cause obstructions because the liquid waste tends to then separate from the solid waste likewise similar problems can occur if the angle of the pipe is too flat because none of the waste is moving fast enough if your homes existing sewer system was working without issue prior to the collapse of the old pipe then perhaps installing the new pvc pipe in the same configuration would be an okay way to go a better option could be for you to consult your local building and sewer department when you are getting the required permits because they can probably tell you the exact depth at which their sewer main is buried in front of your house if by chance their sewer main is buried deep enough then you might be able to move your homes waste pipe where it exits the foundation deeper in the ground while still maintaining the correct drop in grade from your house to the curb if you do not have the option of lowering the pipe deeper in the ground then you will have to insulate the area around the pipe as best you can depending on the average frost depth in the colonial heights area encapsulating the entire pipe with foam insulation for a few feet could be more than enough protection to keep the pipe from freezing of course many sewer pipes avoid freezing altogether because the constant flow of waste water within the system helps keep the overall temperature above the freezing point before starting your project you should probably get some advice from the local contractor who is digging the trench for your new sewer line and ask about the best way to insulate and protect underground sewer lines in your area good lucktags foundation  concrete foundation  sewer line  colonial heights  insulating pipes no responses to “how deep should a houses sewer line be buried”leave a comment name requiredmail will not be published requiredwebsite optionalrefresh enter the text shown above case sensitive
