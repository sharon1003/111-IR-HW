urinary catheterization health guide more what is it in urinary catheterization a catheter hollow tube is inserted into the bladder to drain or collect urine there are two main types of urinary catheterization indwelling catheterization and clean intermittent catheterization cic indwelling catheterization in this type of catheterization one end of the catheter remains inside the bladder a small inflated balloon at the tip of the catheter inside the bladder keeps the end of the catheter from slipping out urine flows from the bladder through the catheter and collects in a drainage bag if the patient is not bedridden this drainage bag can be worn on the leg where it can be hidden under a skirt or slacks if the patient is bedridden the drainage bag usually is attached to the lower portion of the hospital bed near the floor this position allows gravity to help the urine drain an indwelling catheter can be used for shortterm or longterm care cic in cic the urinary catheter does not remain inside the bladder it is inserted into the bladder only long enough to allow the bladder to drain then it is removed cic can be done by the patient or by the patients caregiver for shortterm catheterization after surgery and in certain paralyzed patients cic often is better than an indwelling catheter this is because cic is less likely to cause a urinarytract infection in these situations what its used for urinary catheters are used to remove urine from the bladder in the following situations to relieve a physical obstruction to urine flow such as a urinarytract stone a bladder tumor or an enlarged prostate to drain urine when the bladders muscles or nerves are not working properly this can be caused by a spinal cord injury multiple sclerosis or some other nerve problem also certain medications can interfere with the bladders normal emptying to treat incontinence difficulty holding in urine until you reach the toilet when other methods have failed to drain urine in patients who are unconscious this includes patients who are in a coma or under general anesthesia to measure urine output in infants and children who are not toilet trained to measure urine output in adults who are incapacitated because of critical illness or surgery to obtain a clean urine sample for tests to detect bacteria infections in the urine a clean urine sample is one that is not contaminated by bacteria from the patients hands genitals or rectum with a catheter a clean urine sample can be obtained directly from inside the bladder to collect urine during diagnostic studies of the urinary tract preparation indwelling catheterization health care personnel will open the kit that contains the sterile supplies and gloves beforehand taking care to not touch the inside of the kit to avoid bacterial contamination cic all equipment catheter lubricant urine receptacle should be assembled beforehand caregivers should wear clean disposable gloves when performing cic on a patient for selfcatheterization you should wash your hands thoroughly prior to inserting the catheter gloves are not mandatory for selfcatheterization how its done urinary catheters come in different diameters for adult patients catheters generally are less than onequarter of an inch in diameter indwelling catheter the clothing will be removed from the lower portion of your body and you will lie on your back if you are a woman your knees will be bent and your legs spread apart this will allow the caregiver access to your urethra if you are a man your knees can be either straight or bent a health care professional often a nurse will clean the opening of your urethra with an antiseptic solution then he or she will inject a lubricating jelly into your urethra this injection will be done with a special syringe that has a smooth plastic tip instead of a needle once your urethra is lubricated the tip of the urinary catheter will be inserted gently into the urethras opening slowly the catheter will be advanced up the urethra into your bladder when the catheter tip reaches the bladder urine will begin to flow down through the catheter tube at this point the health care professional advances the catheter a bit further just below the catheter tip there is a balloon that has its own connecting tube the balloon is inflated with a small amount of sterile water or saline salt solution the inflated balloon keeps the catheter from falling out of the bladder once the catheter is in place the drainage bag will be attached the drainage bag should remain below the level of the bladder to ensure that urine drains properly with no backflow cic cic catheters can be made of red rubber latex or plastic some are reusable while others are disposable singleuse models people who do cic catheterization on themselves will want to be next to a toilet or have a urinecollection receptacle ready wash your hands and the catheter with warm soapy water clean the opening of your urethra and spread lubricant on one end of the catheter insert the lubricated catheter tip into your urethra and advance the catheter gently until urine begins to flow allow urine to drain completely into a toilet or urine receptacle once urine stops flowing gently withdraw the catheter if the catheter is reusable wash it in soapy water and allow it to air dry in a ventilated container then wash your hands again before resuming your normal activities if you are a caregiver who is doing cic on a patient the steps are basically the same however you should wear clean disposable gloves during the procedure followup indwelling catheters each day your caregiver will clean the area around your urethra in female patients this area also must be cleaned after every bowel movement your caregiver probably will empty the urine drainage bag about once every eight hours sooner if the bag is full the catheter itself will be changed periodically according to a schedule developed by your nurse or doctor sometimes the catheter becomes obstructed with debris such as mucus protein deposits or tiny mineral crystals when this happens urine flow may stop temporarily to deal with this problem your caregiver will flush the catheter with a special solution to help prevent repeated obstructions of the catheter your doctor may prescribe medication to make your urine more acidic you also will be asked to drink more fluids to help flush your urinary tract if you have had an indwelling catheter for a long period of time your bladder muscles may go into spasm these bladder spasms can force urine to leak around the catheter if this happens your doctor can prescribe antispasmodic medication cic the process needs to be repeated every six to eight hours or as directed by your doctor reusable catheters need to be sterilized periodically according to the manufacturers directions risks when the catheter is inserted insertion of a urinary catheter carries a risk of the following problems the urethra or bladder can be damaged very rarely the bladder wall is punctured the catheter can be inserted into the vagina by mistake this happens most often in infant girls when indwelling catheters are inserted the catheter balloon can be inflated inside the urethra instead of the bladder injuring the urethras wall this complication happens more often in males than in females because the urethra is longer in men after the catheter is inserted whenever a catheter enters the bladder there is a risk that bacteria will get into the urinary tract in many cases the bacteria grow in the urine without causing any symptoms of a urinary tract infection sometimes however the bacteria cause symptoms of a urinary tract infection including a fever and changes in the urines smell and appearance after longterm use of an indwelling catheter in people who need an indwelling catheter for longterm care the following complications can occur the urethra can be damaged or scarred a longterm inflammation or infection of the kidneys can develop stones made of mineral deposits can form inside the kidneys or bladder or on the catheter tip or balloon the scrotum prostate or nearby structures can become infected when to call a professional in someone with a urinary catheter the following symptoms can be signs of infection or other complications contact your doctor or homecare nurse if you have any of these symptoms fever with or without chills pain in the abdomen flank or lower back urine that smells foul or unusually strong urine that is thick cloudy or tinged with blood indwelling catheter little or no output of urine into the drainage bag in spite of attempts to irrigate the catheter indwelling catheter leakage of urine past the catheter external resources national kidney and
