though your throat is closing and coughing is a very common result however there are tangential reasons for coughing as well while hyperventilating many people use coughing as a way to feel like theyre getting a breath for reasons that are not quite clear coughing can make people feel as though theyre clearing their lungs and improving their ability to breathe even though there is also no medical reason that coughing should improve breathing ability another problem comes from the damage that both of those issues cause chronic coughing can irritate the nerves that control the cough
