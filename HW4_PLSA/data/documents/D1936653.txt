options for drivers looking to lease or rent a car but today both uber and lyft now have flexible leasingrental programs and there are a whole host of startups looking to provide flexible options for drivers this is good news in my book as i suspect a lot of drivers aren’t realizing just how much money it’s costing them to operate their vehicle the nice thing about a lot of the new leasing and rental programs is that they are flexible affordable and you see all your costs right up front today rsg senior contributor christian perea takes a look at lyftgm’s foray into rideshare leasing express drive if you’re looking for a comprehensive list of all the leasingrental options available for rideshare drivers please check out our new uber and lyft vehicle marketplace page a few weeks ago lyft announced express drive express drive is like express pay except when you have accumulated 100 in fares you can instead simply tap the “express drive” button within the lyft app to have a chevy equinox airlifted directly to your gps location via a ch53 within around 20 minutes it’s worth noting that there is still a 50 cent fee and those can add up after a while i don’t think the fee covers the cost though…okay so i lied about the first part pardon my immaturity in reality the program is a strategic partnership with general motors and is actually a pretty significant for just under three months of work it aims to provide vehicles as rentals to drivers for as little as one week and as long as 8 weeks lyft will be launching this first in chicago and then baltimore boston and washington d c shortly afterwards — with the intentions of rolling it out to other cities within the year express drive initially intends to offer an option for those who are unable to drive because their car is too old has 2doors or is nonexistent is express drive a big deal for drivers it’s actually about as close to a free rideshare vehicle as you can get the rental price will be based on a tiered system around the number of rides a driver provides the number of rides required will vary by market though here is the tiered setup for chicago99week  020mile if under 40 rides99week flat if 40 rides or above0 if 65 rides or above note as of 9192016 these prices have changed so as far as the cost to operate and own a vehicle this seems like a pretty good deal other leasing options are more expensive and would likely require you to drive a great deal to justify the 120200 weekly lease beyond that options like breeze or xchange leasing still expect you to pay for your own insurance and maintenance like brakes and tires it appears that express drive covers all of that when you are no longer stressing about whether or not your transmission will blow up before you can pay off your car it makes driving more enjoyable now those cheap ride payouts will go mostly towards your pockets instead of your tires sounds almost too good to be true right we’ll get to that in a minute what is included in the express drive rental a chevy equinox okay so you probably didn’t have one of these as a poster on your wall as a kid that being said it looks more roomy than a prius and sits much higher so it should be interesting to see how comfortable it rides i am going to assume that the rental will be the base version which has a 4cylinder rated at around 180hp mated to a fwd transmission gas mileage is reported as 22 city and 32 highway obviously since this is not a hybrid or prius you should expect to pay more in gas though looks all right insurance when logged into driver mode the rental falls under lyft’s insurance in a similar fashion to any other car on the platform 2500 deductible when you are logged off the insurance switches over to the insurance that is provided through the gmmaven rental side 1000 deductible so basically the insurance is always provided by lyftgm maintenance maintenance is handled solely by gm and it’s supposed to be all inclusive if a passenger damages the vehicle via vomit you simple take it in and get a new one it also covers brakes tires shocks and all that other stuff drivers are expected to return their vehicles every 8 weeks for maintenance and cleaning term 8 weeks max per vehicle when your term is up you can return the vehicle for a different one the catch 025 for miles driven outside of driver mode any miles driven outside of driver mode will cost 020mile regardless of how many rides you do this means that even if you give 120 lyft rides in a week you will still be charged for any distance that is not in driver mode double dipping if you end up using the rental to drive for uber or delivery it will incur a 020mile charge so that sort of eliminates doubledipping between platforms submarinestealth mode it also means that if you tend to logout of driver mode to head towards busier areas you will still incur that charge in the process unless you…use the destination filteraccording to lyft miles driven while using the destination filter will not be billed as “personal” miles this means that anyone in the program is going to get intimate with the fine details of the destination filter as far as i know it can only be used 3 times a day commuting many people commute to the area they drive in many people also like to logout of driver mode when they decide to make the long commute home since we have confirmed with lyft that destination filter will count as “lyft” miles commuters should set their filter to prevent themselves from getting charged this is important because many drivers commute a great distance to begin driving since most can’t afford to live in the city update 091216 destination filter rides and miles will now count as “personal miles” at 025mile power driver bonushourly guarantees those who use the rental will not qualify for the power driver bonus to earn their commissions back from lyft they also will not qualify for average hourly guarantees guaranteed primetime and tips should still payout like any other ride though so you won’t be able to hop in your lyft rental and drive to canada or take it on long road trips clearly this program has been designed to make sure that those who use it will be driving primarily for lyft and switching loyalty will exact a hefty price in the process much lower expenses but you must drive mostly lyft to compare costs i delved into our trusty driver model that we built out using quick books selfemployed and adjusted expenses accordingly the result was that using express drive and meeting the ride goals to waive the rental fee dramatically lowered car costs while increasing the costs in the fuel category when compared to a 2014 prius the overall effect was the elimination of an auto loan 4700year insurance 1492year maintenance 1500year and registration 200 i didn’t include depreciation costs but those are also a big factor further the difference in gas costs is much smaller for those who wouldn’t drive a hybrid in the first place note don’t forget about the 020mile cost for non drivermode miles for the express drive math we assumed that the driver would drive 48360 miles a year and that 20 would end up being calculated as personal use and thus adding 1934 in rental costs even under this scenario business spending was only 14992 for an express drive model versus owning a 2014 prius 20075 and a typical rideshare lease 27010related how much does it really cost to be a rideshare driver here is our comparison of costs using quick books selfemployed between express drive traditional financing and a rideshare lease express drive 7101year with gas and mileage fees traditional financing 397month 12164 a year rideshare lease 195week  016 after 800 milesweek 19118 if you would like to get a good

of this post my take express drive makes a lot of sense in markets where lyft and uber are competitive on ride volume the nature of the program definitely ties you to driving almost solely with lyft to avoid those mileage charges though so if you are in a market where lyft isn’t comparable in volume it may be hard to tie yourself to one option even if it costs less the program definitely seems like it would be much less stressful for a fulltime driver even if it meant giving up the power driver bonus and average hourly guarantees because you are only really worrying about gas and the miles logged outside of driver mode if the program came to san francisco i would definitely signup to avoid putting miles on my personal vehicle the program is still in its early phases and we will make sure to keep you updated as it grows and details become clearer drivers what do you think about lyft’s new express drive program does it sound like something you would sign up for if you’re looking
