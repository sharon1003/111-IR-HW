rolex luxury watches watches how many rolex watches are produced per year5 answers jason preston ive had a lot of watches answered jun 11 2017tldr they produce about a million watches a year probably closer to 12 million in the sixties they started at about 90000yr ending the decade at about 150–200000 watches per year in the seventies production continued to increase to about 350–400000 watches per year in the eighties they hit about 500000 per year and continued a steady increase to around a million watches a year so i see some people quoting sales number and doing some fancy math to figure out the number of watches sold ok division isn’t that fancy i’ll admit the thing is rolex doesn’t sell to the consumer they have authorized dealers that don’t pay that 10000 retail price to rolex so how could sales numbers divided by x dollars ever equate to an accurate production number also my local rolex dealer would have to be the worst salesman i’ve ever met to lose 25 selling to me at a discount for those numbers to work also rolex has different prices in different countries and have fought hard to keep down international watch sales in order to dial in the perfect price in each market to maximize profits so much so that it was illegal to buy rolex’s abroad and bring them back into us for resale for example so revenue profits etc will never yield a perfect number rolex is an incredibly complicated completely vertically integrated machine that even has it’s own foundries to smelt their alloys at this point the only in the world they produce quite a bit but don’t always release every single piece to the public i’m not saying they’re stockpiling but they do pull stock from dealers at times to increase scarcity and balance supply and demand it was easier to estimate annual production numbers when every watch was consecutively serial numbered production and sales don’t ever match up on a company level only on some high demand models52k views · view

number is too high based on some other extrapolations we have done wiki reports that rolex had total annual sales of 51 billion last year if the average sale was 10000 that would equate to about 500000 watches and if the average was lower at say 7500 then that would make that total number of watches reach about 65000069k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still
