there’s more than one way to cure a powder coat hopefully at this point in your wood powder coating education you have learned that there are three types of ovens used to cure powder after it has been sprayed on the surface of a piece of medium density fiberboard mdf curing is the final part of the powder coated wood process some type of heat needs to be applied at this point so that the powder particles will gel flow bond and wrap around the surface of the wood there are three methods by which heat is transferred from one body to another conduction convection and radiation the cure ovens used in any powder coat wood process will use convection or radiation to quickly cure the board at the optimal temperature once the powder has melted a powder coat can be cured using ultraviolet convection or infrared curing ovens each type of heating oven offers excellent features and benefits however there are downsides to each one in this article we will explore each type of oven and discuss what type of heat gcc coatings uses curing with convection – cure ovens using convection are very popular and widely used in the powder coating industry convection ovens heat and circulate the air within the oven the heat is transferred to the powder coated part by the circulation of the hot air a major benefit of convection curing is that the oven can be powered in one of three ways directfired gas indirectfired gas and electric indirectfired gas and electric convection ovens are preferred over the directfired gas variety however with a directfired oven the byproducts of combustion can end up in the air being circulated around the oven another plus for convection curing is the low thermal head which makes it difficult to ruin the substrate through overheating that benefit can quickly turn into a downside though if convection is unable to provide the needed heat intensity to melt the powder to the mdf the low thermal head also makes this a very slow and high energy consuming curing method a convection oven would also cause fits for any manufacturer with limited floor space curing with ultraviolet uv – various manufacturers have been using radiation as an option for curing for many years now an ultraviolet cure is a photochemical process that uses high intensity uv light to quickly cure coatings uv light falls between short visible rays and longer xrays with a wavelength of 100380 nanometers uv curing is basically a chemical reaction that occurs when the mdf comes into contact with ultraviolet light a photo initiator must be mixed in with the coating so that the chemical reaction will begin when uv light is introduced to the part note that ultraviolet does not actually give off any heat so an ir or convection gel oven will be required to actually melt the powder causing it to gel and flow prior to being exposed to the uv light there are a variety of ways to make ultraviolet curing work but all will involve the basic chemical reaction principle explained above it is important to note here as well that ultraviolet curing will require a particular type of powder that is different from what is used with convection and infrared an ultraviolet cure works very quickly it does not take long for the high intensity uv light to cure the powder giving it a very high productivity rate uv ovens do not require a great deal of space or energy to be operational as an added bonus there is far less urgency when dealing with uncured parts because the powder will not cure under typical room lighting it has to come in contact with uv light before the curing process will begin though high intensity ultraviolet light may not be visible to the naked human eye it can be quite harmful the high intensity nature of the light also makes it possible for a heat sensitive substrate like wood to be damaged curing with infrared ir – infrared ovens use ir electromagnetic waves to cure the powder ir light falls between visible light and microwaveradio waves on the electromagnetic spectrum this curing method works by emitting bright visible infrared light at one of two energy levels high energy ir is transmitted through the coating to heat the substrate medium energy ir will be absorbed directly by the coating an infrared oven can be operated using either electricity or natural gas however it will not have any of the combustion by products you would find in a directfired gas convection oven gcc coatings uses infrared catalytic natural gas ovens infrared is very clean it provides rapid heat up and intense heat capable of curing the powder without ruining or causing damage to the mdf the biggest downside of the ir curing method is that it is limited to line of sight that means ir energy is only capable of traveling in a straight line thus only those sections of the part facing the heat source are able to absorb the heat energy this is not a major concern for us however because when the powder gels it will flow and wrap around the surface of the mdf board manufacturers who are coating more detailed and intricate parts have turned to a hybrid irconvection heating oven to alleviate the problem mentioned above irconvection combination ovens provide a quick controlled heating option bringing together the best qualities of both cure methods these systems are set up in three stages the preheat zone equipped with ir emitters to quickly increase the temperature of the coating and surface substrate next is the equalization zone which uses both ir and convection to give a uniform temperature to every inch of the part surface the final stage is the holding zone using only convection heating to maintain a predetermined temperature and ensure an even finish that is everything you need to know about the three options for curing powder coated wood using the right heat source is imperative to getting the powder to stick to the surface of the wood gcc coatings has used infrared catalytic ovens for curing since we started powder coating wood we have successfully used this method to powder coat thousands of parts and components for products varying from garage cabinets to pinball machines contact us
