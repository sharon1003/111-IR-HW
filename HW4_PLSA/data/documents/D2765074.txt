ˈ d aɪ iː n  dy een or diolefin   d aɪ ˈ oʊ l ə f ɪ n  dy oh ləfin is a hydrocarbon that contains two carbon double bonds dienes occur occasionally in nature conjugated dienes are widely used as

ligands4 see also5 external links6 references classes  editdienes can be divided into three classes depending on the relative location of the double bonds cumulated dienes have the double bonds sharing a common atom as in a group of compounds called allenes conjugated dienes have conjugated double bonds separated by one single bond unconjugated dienes have the double bonds separated by two or more single bonds they are usually less stable than isomeric conjugated dienes this can also be known as an isolated diene some dienes a 12propadiene also known as allene is the simplest cumulated diene b isoprene also known as 2methyl13butadiene the precursor to natural rubber c 13butadiene a precursor to synthetic polymers d 15cyclooctadiene an unconjugated diene notice that each double bond is two carbons away from the other e norbornadiene a strained bicyclic and unconjugated diene f dicyclopentadiene g linoleic acid a fatty acid that is required in the human diet compounds that contain more than two double bonds are called polyenes polyenes and dienes share many of their properties synthesis of dienes  editon an industrial scale butadiene is prepared by thermal cracking of butanes in a similarly nonselective process dicyclopentadiene is obtained from coal tars in the laboratory more directed and more delicate processes are employed such as dehydrohalogenations and condensations myriad methods have been developed such as the whiting reaction families of nonconjugated dienes are derived from the oligomerization and dimerization of conjugated dienes for example 15cyclooctadiene and vinylcyclohexene are produced by dimerization of 13butadiene dienecontaining fatty acids are biosynthesized from acetyl co aαωdienes have the formula ch 2 n chch 2 2 they are prepared industrially by ethenolysis of cyclic dienes for example 15hexadiene and 19decadiene useful crosslinking agents and synthetic intermediates are produced from 15cyclooctadiene and cyclooctene respectively the catalyst is derived from re 2 o 7 on alumina 1reactivity and uses  editpolymerization  editthe most heavily practiced reaction of alkenes dienes included is polymerization 13butadiene is a precursor to rubber used in tires and isoprene is the precursor to natural rubber chloroprene is related but it is a synthetic monomer cycloadditions  editan important reaction for conjugated dienes is the diels–alder reaction many specialized dienes have been developed to exploit this reactivity for the synthesis of natural products eg danishefskys diene  other addition reactions  editconjugated dienes add reagents such as bromine and hydrogen by both 12addition and 14addition pathways addition of polar reagents can generate complex architectures 2metathesis reactions  editnonconjugated dienes are substrates for ringclosing metathesis reactions these reactions require a metal catalyst acidity  editthe position adjacent to a double bond is acidic because the resulting allyl anion is stabilized by resonance this effect becomes more pronounced as more alkenes are involved to create greater stability for example deprotonation at position 3 of a 14diene or position 5 of a 13diene give a pentadienyl anion an even greater effect is seen if the anion is aromatic for example deprotonation of cyclopentadiene to give the cyclopentadienyl anion c 2symmetric diene ligand used in asymmetric catalysis 3as ligands  editdienes are widely used chelating ligands in organometallic chemistry in some cases they serve as placeholder ligands being removed during a catalytic cycle for example the cyclooctadiene cod ligands in bis cyclooctadienenickel 0 are labile in some cases dienes are spectator ligands remaining coordinated throughout a catalytic cycle and influencing the product distributions chiral dienes have also been described 4 other diene complexes include butadieneiron tricarbonyl and cyclooctadiene rhodium chloride dimer see also  editpolyenebenzene external links
