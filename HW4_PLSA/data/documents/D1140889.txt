of many pacific languages although the path through the tree from protooceanic to a specific language is not always clear the word and concept are thousands of years old according to linguist robert blust mana means thunder storm or wind in some languages blust hypothesized that the term originally meant powerful forces of nature such as thunder and storm winds that were conceived as the expression of an unseen supernatural agency as oceanicspeaking peoples spread eastward the notion of an unseen supernatural agency became detached from the physical forces of nature that had inspired it and assumed a life of its own 3polynesian culture  editmana is a foundation of the polynesian worldview a spiritual quality with a supernatural origin and a sacred impersonal force to have mana

codrington taught and worked missionary robert henry codrington traveled widely in melanesia publishing several studies of its language and culture his 1891 book the melanesians studies in their anthropology and folklore contains the first detailed description of mana codrington defines it as a force altogether distinct from physical power which acts in all kinds of ways for good and evil and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or control 11his era had already defined animism the concept that the energy or life in an object derives from a spiritual component georg ernst stahl s 18thcentury animism was adopted by edward burnett tylor the founder of cultural anthropology who presented his initial ideas about the history of religion in his 1865 researches into the early history of mankind 12 vi and developed them in volumes one 1871 and two 1874 of primitive culture 12 1tylors cultural evolution  editin tylors cultural anthropology other primates from which evolutionists hypothesized man had evolved did not appear to possess culture note 1tylor did not try to find evidence of a noncultural human state because he considered it unreachable a condition not far removed from that of the lower animals and savage life as in some sort representing an early known state 12 33 he described such a hypothetical state as the human savage naked in both mind and body and destitute of laws or arts or ideas and almost of language 12 30 according to tylor speculation about an acultural state is impossible using the method of comparative culture similar to comparative anatomy and the comparative method of historical linguistics and following john lubbock he drew up a dual classification of cultural traits  memes and memeplexes  savage and civilised tylor wrote from an ideal point of view civilization may be looked upon as the general improvement of mankind by higher organization of the individual and of society   12 24 and identified his model with the progressiontheory of civilization 12 81evolution of religion  edittylor cited a minimum definition of religion as the belief in spiritual beings 12 383 noting that no savage societies lack religion and that the initial state of a religious man is beyond reach he enumerated two stages in the evolution of religion a simple belief in individual animae or doctrine of souls and the elaboration of dogmas the dogmas are systems of higher spirits commanding phases of nature in volume two of primitive culture tylor called this stage the doctrine of spirits 12 108–110 he used the word animism in two different senses 12 385 the first is religion itself a belief in the spiritual as an effective energy shared by every specific religion in his progression theory an undogmatic version preceded rational theological systems animism is the simple theory of the soul which comparative religion attempts to reconstruct tylors work predated codringtons and he was unfamiliar with the latter the concept of mana occasioned a revision of tylors view of the evolution of religion the first anthropologist to formulate a revision which he called preanimistic religion was robert ranulph marett in a series of papers collected and published as threshold of religion in its preface he takes credit for the adjective preanimistic but not the noun preanimism although he does not attribute it 13 xxi according to marett animism will not suffice as a minimum definition of religion tylor had used the term natural religion 12 386 consistent with georg ernst stahls concept of a natural spiritual energy the soul of an animal for example is its vital principle marett wrote one must dig deeper to find the roots of religion  citation neededpreanimism  editdescribing preanimism marett cited the melanesian mana primarily with codringtons work when the science of comparative religion employs a native expression such as mana  it is obliged to disregard to some extent its original or local meaning  science then may adopt mana as a general category   13 99 in melanesia the animae are the souls of living men the ghosts of deceased men and spirits of ghostlike appearance or imitating living people spirits can inhabit other objects such as animals or stones 13 115–120the most significant property of mana is that it is distinct from and exists independently of its source animae act only through mana it is impersonal undistinguished and like energy transmissible between objects which can have more or less of it mana is perceptible appearing as a power of awfulness in the sense of awe or wonder 13 12–13 objects possessing it impress an observer with respect veneration propitiation service emanating from the manas power marett lists a number of objects habitually possessing mana startling manifestations of nature curious stones animals human remains blood 13 2 thunderstorms eclipses eruptions glaciers and the sound of a bullroarer 13 14–17if mana is a distinct power it may be treated distinctly marett distinguishes spells which treat mana quasiobjectively and prayers which address the anima  an anima may have departed leaving mana in the form of a spell which can be addressed by magic although marett postulates an earlier preanimistic phase a rudimentary religion or magicoreligious phase in which the mana figures without animae no island of pure preanimism is to be found 13 xxvi like tylor he theorizes a thread of commonality between animism and preanimism identified with the supernatural —the mysterious as opposed to the reasonable 13 22criticism  editin 1936 ian hogbin criticised the universality of maretts preanimism mana is by no means universal and consequently to adopt it as a basis on which to build up a general theory of primitive religion is not only erroneous but indeed fallacious 14 however marett intended the concept as an abstraction 13 99 spells for example may be found from central australia to scotland 13 55early 20thcentury scholars also saw mana as a universal concept found in all human cultures and expressing fundamental human awareness of a sacred life energy in his 1904 essay outline of a general theory of magic marcel mauss drew on the writings of codrington and others to paint a picture of mana as power par excellence the genuine effectiveness of things which corroborates their practical actions without annihilating them 15 111 mauss pointed out the similarity of mana to the iroquois orenda and the algonquian manitou convinced of the universality of the institution 15 116 a concept encompassing the idea of magical power was once found everywhere 15 117mauss and his collaborator henri hubert were criticised for this position when their 1904 outline of a general theory of magic was published no one questioned the existence of the notion of mana wrote mausss biographer marcel fournier but hubert and mauss were criticized for giving it a universal dimension 16 criticism of mana as an archetype of life energy increased according to mircea eliade the idea of mana is not universal in places where it is believed not everyone has it and even among the varying formulae  mana wakan orenda etc there are if not glaring differences certainly nuances not sufficiently observed in the early studies 17 with regard to these theories founded upon the primordial and universal character of mana we must say without delay that they have been invalidated by later research 18see also  edittaboo notes  edit the discovery that primates and other mammals have some culture
