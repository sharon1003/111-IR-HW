questiondr s a alam  what exactly you want to know about these ig g  customer i just want to know what m pneumoniae ig g abs is and how it is treated also how serious is it dr s a alam  these are antibodies in the blood of a person that are formed against infection from mycoplasma pneumonia dr s a alam  there are two types of these antibodies dr s a alam  one type is ig m and other important type is ig g dr s a alam presence of ig m indicates an acute infection dr s a alam  while presence of ig g indicates either an old infection or immunity against infection dr s a alam  so presence of these antibodies are actually a good marker an indicate good immunity against infection dr s a alam  your thoughts  dr s a alam  you there  customer why is he having severe shortness of breath and on o2 is this serious in someone 83 with heart problems and lung problems someone said it could lead to menningitis dr s a alam  both heart and lung problems can lead to shortness of brea dr s a alam breath dr s a alam  to rule out heart problem they can do blood tests like troponin i and echocardiogram of the heart dr s a alam  to see for the lung problem the tests that can be done are ct scan of chest culture tests for lung secretions arterial blood gases customer so how serious is this and can it lead to menningitis h e is also confused dr s a alam  even low blood counts like low hemoglobin can lead to such symptoms dr s a alam  have they done his ct brain  or mri brain  customer have done lung ct blood count hemoglobin ok dr s a alam  if they have not done his ct brain then they need to do this test and then plan a spinal tap to see for meningitis dr s a alam  as chest infections can lead to meningitis specially in ages above 60dr s a alam  this spinal tap test is very important and will help in identifying the causing agent for his confusionmeningitis dr s a alam  your thoughts  customer his antibiotics hwere changed again this am they are checking his urine output and have is o2 at 45 to keep it above 90 customer alsowhat would they look for in a brain ct dr s a alam  to change antibiotics there should be some evidence these can only be changed if there is a strong clinical suspicion or tests showing some specific organism dr s a alam  i think they are getting on well by planning ct brain dr s a alam  this should be done as soon as possible dr s a alam  as these diseases proceed very quickly customer they determined he has m pneumonia thats all dr s a alam  if i was his doctor i would have done ct brain and then spinal tap to see for the causing bacteria or virus for his condition customer why brain dr s a alam  as there are ig g antibodies against m pneumonia so it is pretty likely that your husband is developing immunity against this infection customer explain more please dr s a alam  if a person is getting confused then brain pathology is suspected so that is the reason he should get a ct brain and spinal tap dr s a alam  in his case they are most likely suspecting an infection in the brain that might have transferred from lungs via blood to brain dr s a alam  so it is very important that he get a ct brain ct brain is done before spinal tap to make sure that fluid pressure in the brain dr s a alam is not high customer so this is blood borne he is coughing up bloody mucus dr s a alam  yes in most cases infection enters the brain via blood dr s a alam  in his case most likely his lungs were infected and infection has traveled from lungs via blood to his brain dr s a alam  i hope this was helpful customer he has been sick a week 3 days at
