the costs of boat ownership august 1 2011 by lazy man 12 comments today’s post is from sf boater a friend of mine who chronicles his voyages i have very little experience with boats and the associated financials so i suggested that he share that aspect with lazy man and money readers boats are a part of my life… they always have been growing up in fl on the intercoastal waterway i loved fishing and boating and sometimes even boating and fishing even now that i am in the bay area i have fond memories of those days when i graduated college and moved to the bay area the one thing i missed more than anything else was actually being on the water… not being a sailor boats that can safely go out on the bay regularly are pricey the wind usually picks up something fierce in the summer afternoons as the fog rolls in i took the plunge last summer in tahoe i am now a proud boat owner… and have had a few adventures in the first year  president’s day on the bay at lake sonoma barry bonds last home game as a giant and of course the 45 hours i put on the boat when i bought it in tahoe which brings me to the point of this post… saturday lazy man energi gal and my grand inlaws went to mc covey cove to listen to and enjoy the giants play against the st louis cardinals it was an incredible day — 85 degrees 5 mph winds and not a cloud in the sky at some point during the day i got roped into writing the guest post on the costs of boat ownership so with all the fun reasons why one would like to own a boat laid out… here are some of the reasons to remain boat free…1 the 2 happiest days in a boat owner’s like are the day heshe buys the boat and the day the boat is sold 2 i bought a new boat that came with a 6 year warranty but if you are buying a used boat to save money then you are inheriting someone else’s problems 3 my new boat with the 6 year warranty made it very easy to buy — 15 years 715 interest what credit crunch 4 maintenance is expensive… while any problems will be fixed under warranty i am still responsible for maintenance 5 fuel prices are only going up… have you every tried to buy gas on the water take you local land prices and multiple by 40100 6 you need to register your boat 7 you need to store your boat i decline to state what my monthly costs are but suffice it is to say that i am not a frugal warrior when it comes to the boat but for me it is entirely worth it…lazy man and energi gal seemed to agree if only because the only thing better than owning a boat is a friend that owns a boat email and share this email facebook twitter pinterest google filed under spending tagged with boat ownership boats buying a used boat credit crunch inter coastal waterway lake sonoma st louis cardinals
