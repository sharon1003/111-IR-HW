difference between the single 45 rpm and album versions is that the single version fades out almost immediately after the final line is sung in some countries a shorter 532 edit was released the largest change is the complete removal of the baseball playbyplay section jim steinman had stated that he wanted to write the ultimate carsex song in which everything goes horribly wrong in the end 3according to meat loaf on vh1 storytellers the original length of the track was to be 27 minutes  citation neededcomposition  editthe song is divided into three parts part i paradise the song opens with the characters reminiscing about days as a young high school couple on a date they are parking by a lake and having fun experiencing paradise by the dashboard light until the male character insists theyre gonna go all the way tonight the audio track suddenly cuts out quickly pans through the left and right channels once before slowly returning to both channels baseball broadcast his pushing the matter is mirrored by new york yankees announcer phil rizzuto broadcasting a portion of a baseball game that serves as a metaphor for his attempts to achieve his goal accompanied by funk instrumentation and the two characters talking in the two individual left and right channels rizzutos baseball playbyplay call was recorded in 1976 at the hit factory in new york city by producer todd rundgren meat loaf and steinman rizzuto publicly maintained he was unaware that his contribution would be equated with sex in the finished song but meat loaf asserts that rizzuto only feigned ignorance to stifle some criticism from a priest and was fully aware of the context of what he was recording 4in a nod to the yankees – red sox rivalry some radio stations in boston created a version where rizzutos part was substituted with red sox announcer dick stockton describing the baseball play  citation neededpart ii let me sleep on it just as the boy is about to score via the suicide squeeze  the girl bursts out telling him to stop right there she refuses to go any further unless the boy first promises to love her forever and marry her reluctant to make such a longterm commitment the boy repeatedly asks her to continue on for the time being and promises to give his answer in the morning however as she is not giving in that easily so that he finally cracks and gives his promise i started swearing to my god and on my mothers gravethat i would love you to the end of time part iii praying for the end of time back in the present the characters can no longer stand each others presence however the male character cannot possibly break his vow and hence is now praying for the end of time to relieve him from his obligation the song fades out on the situation juxtaposing his gloomy it was long ago it was far away it was so much better than it is today in the left channel with her nostalgic it never felt so good it never felt so right we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife in the right channel in early live performances of the song this part and thus the conclusion of the song itself was followed by a spokenword epilogue by meat loaf and karla de vito where they still in character as the two protagonists argued about what to keep after the couples divorce having been presumably married for a number of years the argument was cut short by de vito shouting  and ill keep the baby  which left meat loafs character speechless as he apparently ignored the existence of a baby immediately after he ended the argument by screaming incoherently at her 5 the exchange was repeated with different female vocalists in different versions and with different endings in most of meat loafs subsequent live tours and remains in the set to the present day when it is still occasionally performed by meat loaf and his current featured vocalist patti russo music video  edit35mm prints of a liveonsoundstage performance of paradise were struck and initially sent to many theaters holding midnight screenings of the rocky horror picture show as a short subject to play before the feature very few of these prints are still extant andor in playable condition the video also received healthy airplay in the first years of mtv despite its relative age to the new artists the channel was showcasing although ellen foley is recorded on the album another woman karla de vito was used for the music video and for live performances 6 this would also happen for meat loafs 1993 hit  id do anything for love but i wont do that  where dana patrick mimed to lorraine crosby s

karla de vito before the song performance on the hits out of hell music video compilation the prologue was removed and spliced in front of the video for you took the words right out of my mouth
