color bands from yellow to gray humidity we base the humidity comfort level on the dew point as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin thereby cooling the body lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid unlike temperature which typically varies significantly between night and day dew point tends to change more slowly so while the temperature may drop at night a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night the chance that a given day will be muggy in south san francisco is essentially constant during may remaining around 0 throughout for

of nonfreezing temperatures ≥ 32°f in the year the calendar year in the northern hemisphere or from july 1 until june 30 in the southern hemisphere temperatures in south san francisco are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms we nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures

artificial surfaces  31  and within 50 miles by water  45 and grassland  18  data sources this report illustrates the typical weather in south san francisco year round based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from january 1 1980 to december 31 2016 temperature and dew point there are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in south san francisco for each station the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and south san francisco according to the international standard atmosphere and by the relative change present in the merra2 satelliteera reanalysis between the two locations the estimated value at south san francisco is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between south san francisco and a given station the stations contributing to this reconstruction are san francisco international airport 76 54 kilometers southeast and naval air station alameda historical 24 12 kilometers northeast other data all data relating to the suns position eg sunrise and sunset are computed using astronomical formulas from the book astronomical tables of the sun moon and planets by jean meeus all other weather data including cloud cover precipitation wind speed and direction and solar flux come from nasas merra2 modernera retrospective analysis this reanalysis combines a variety of widearea measurements in a stateoftheart global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50kilometer grid land use data comes from the global land cover share database published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations elevation data comes from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm published by nasas jet propulsion laboratory names locations and time zones of places

data is prone to errors outages and other defects we assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site we draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the merra2 modelbased reconstructions for a number of important data series while having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness these reconstructions 1 are based on computer models that may have modelbased errors 2 are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates and 3 have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas especially small islands we further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader
