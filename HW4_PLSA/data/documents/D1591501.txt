wrote a dissertation on “banked blood” in which he described a technique he developed for the longterm preservation of blood plasma prior to his discovery blood could not be stored for more than two days because of the rapid breakdown of red blood cells drew had discovered that by separating the plasma the liquid part of blood from the whole blood in which the red blood cells exist and then refrigerating them separately they could be combined up to a week later for a blood transfusion he also discovered that while everyone has a certain type of blood a b ab or o and thus are prevented from receiving a full blood transfusion from someone with different blood everyone has the same type of plasma thus in certain cases where a whole blood transfusion is not necessary it was sufficient
