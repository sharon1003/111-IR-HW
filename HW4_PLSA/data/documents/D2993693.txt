patientsperday norms qa  january 01 2008question i am wondering what is the average number of patients seen per day by a generalprimary care internal medicine physician i am having trouble locating this specific information answer i don’t know of published norms but anecdotally i see practices treating anywhere from 25 to 45 patients a day the “norm” is 20 to 25 it really depends on a physician’s personality type and what that physician needs to do to make ends meet some people are maxed out at 25 others breeze through 60 no problem a more nuanced and credible standard might be to measure relative value units or rvus according to data from the medical group management association the median rvus per year for general internal medicine is 7716 excluding technical component charges and nonphysician practitioner work your management software should be able to run a report for you on rvus per year disclosures oldest first newest first there are no comments for this article
