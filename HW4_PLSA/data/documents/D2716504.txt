scenerychewing to come from russell crowe this song should have a beautiful soaring belt towards the end that makes the almost bitter drop into now life has killed the dream i dreamed even more effective  shes completely lost that she basically whimpers through the entire thing  once youve heard the first few lines there isnt any point in continuing to listen because she doesnt do anything different i know several amateur singers just in this area who could blow her out of the water what a shame  she can do better than this14031click to rate mira london 5 years ago i like anne hathaway and good for her to take on this role although she sounds better on the oscars clip i agree that her singing voice in the film trailer suits the role as it would be daft for her to belt out a glossy pitch perfect version considering the characters struggle look forward to this even though i cant stand russell crowe hugh jackman will make up for that and he has a brilliant singing voice1078click to rate alex calgary canada 5 years ago itll be interesting to see how well or not this movie does sadly in this era of sequels and superhero films and the fact musicals that dont begin with the word disneys and have 3d cgi animation have a sketchy track record over the past decade will les miz be too highbrow for mainstream audiences time will tell nice to see them trying anyway and i had a feeling when jackman and hathaway did that duo at the oscars a few years back that theyd eventually team up in some form of musical would this be the first major hollywood musical to feature its

the people who criticize annes appearance  voice should maybe read the book then maybe they would understand more i saw the stage show several times both in canada  london each time though i enjoyed the singing immensely i was puzzled how a dying fantine could be singing with such power regardless of her emotions at the time yes she was bitter she was close to death so would hardly have strength to belt out a song get real  as to her hair fantine sold her hair to provide for her daughters upkeep it was done by a fancy stylist it was hacked off why would you expect her hair to look good this movie seems to be following the book rather than the stage show versions9120click to rate view all the views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the
