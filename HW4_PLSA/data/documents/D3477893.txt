introduction one of the most common test inputs used is the unit step functionthe response of a system with all initial conditions equal to zero at t0  ie a zero state response to the unit step input is called the unit step response if the problem you are trying to solve also has initial conditions you need to include a zero input response in order to obtain the complete response if you dont know about laplace transforms there are time domain methods to calculate the step response general solution we can easily find the step input of a system from its transfer function given a system with input x t output y t and transfer function h sthe output with zero initial conditions ie the zero state output is simply given byso the unit step response y γ s is given by immediately we can determine two characteristics of the unit step response the initial and final values of the step response by invoking the initial and final value theorems initial value theorem final value theorem sooften we simplify this and writestep response of a first order system first we will consider a generic first order system then we will proceed with several examples consider a generic first order transfer function given bywhere a b and c are arbitrary real numbers and either b or c but not both may be zero to find the unit step response we multiply h s by 1sand take the inverse laplace transform using partial fraction expansionso we now note several features about this equation namely thus we can write the general form of the unit step response as this last equation is important it states that if we can determine the initial value of a first order system at t0 the final value and the time constant that we dont need to actually solve any equations we can simply write the result likewise if we experimentally determine the initial value final value and time constant then we know the transfer function key concept step response of a first order system the unit step response of a first order system is time constants of first order systems the time constant of first order systems is often easy to find the time constants of some typical first order systems are given in the table

function for mb1 we get alternate solution without inverse laplace transformfrom the transfer function we infer that using the general form of the step response of a first order system we get alternate solution without laplace transformthe system starts at rest and the velocity of a mass cant change instantaneously with a finite input so v 0  0 the final velocity is independent of the mass because there is no inertial force at constant velocity so f ∞bv ∞ or v ∞f ∞b1b the time constant of a frictionmass system is mb so example step response of first order system 2if the input force of the following system is a step of amplitude x 0 meters find y t also shown is a free body diagram note the input is not a unit step but has a magnitude of x 0  therefore all system outputs must also be scaled by x 0 solution the differential equation describing the system isso the transfer function is determined by taking the laplace transform with zero initial conditions and solving for y sx sto find the unit step response multiply the transfer function by the step of amplitude x 0 x 0 s and solve by looking up the inverse transform in the laplace transform table exponentialnote remember that v t is implicitly zero for t0 ie it is multiplied by a unit step function for kb1 x 0 2 we get note input and output are in different directions because they were defined that way in system drawingalternate solution without inverse laplace transformfrom the transfer function we infer that note we have to multiply y 0 and y ∞ by x 0 because the input is unit step multiplied by x 0  using the general form of the step response of a first order system we get alternate solution without laplace transformthe length of the daspot cant change instantaneously with a finite force so x 0  x 0  the final position is independent of the dashpot because there is no friction force at zero velocity so x ∞0 the time constant of a frictionspring system is bk so example step response of first order system 3if the input voltage e in t of the following system is a unit step find e out t solution first we find the transfer function we note that the circuit is a voltage divider with two impedanceswhere z 1 is r 1 and z 2 is r 2 in series with c to find the unit step response multiply the transfer function by the unit step 1s and the inverse laplace transform using partial fraction expansion  with r 1 r 2 1k ohm and c1μf we get alternate solution without inverse laplace transformfrom the transfer function we infer that using the general form of the step response of a first order system we get clearly that was much simpler than the previous solution using partial fraction expansionalternate solution without laplace transformat t0 the capacitor has no voltage across it so we have a simple voltage divider and e out 0r 2  r 1 r 2  as t→∞ no current flows because of the capacitor so e out ∞e in ∞1 from the perspective of the capacitor the resistors are in series so the time constant is c·r eq c r 1 r 2  therefore as beforekey concept step response of a first order system the unit step response of a first order system is given by step response of a second order system as you would expect the response of a second order system is more complicated than that of a first order system whereas the step response of a first order system could be fully defined by a time constant determined by pole of transfer function and initial and final values the step response of a second order system is in general much more complex as a start the generic form of a second order transfer function is given bywhere a b c d and e are arbitrary real numbers and at least one of the numerator terms is nonzero step response of prototype second order lowpass system it is impossible to totally separate the effects of each of the five numbers in the generic transfer function so lets start with a somewhat simpler case where ab0 then we can rewrite the transfer function aswhere we have introduced three constants note the term ζ is read as zeta also note that ω 0 is always a positive number the choice of these constants may seem arbitrary but we will soon show that the choice simplifies the mathematics and that all three constants have a physical interpretation that helps give insights into a system we call this the prototype second order lowpass system because the frequency response of this system is lowpass dont worry if you dont know what that means yet to find the unit step response of the system we first multiply by 1s the laplace transform of a unit step inputbefore we can solve for y γ t let us first try to factor the denominator into first order terms the roots of the denominator of the transfer function s 2 2ζω 0 sω 02 are determined from the quadratic equation the value of ζ determines five cases of interest that are given special names whose origin will soon be apparent name value of ζ roots of s characteristics of soverdamped ζ1 two real and negative roots critically damped ζ1 a single negative roots underdamped 0ζ1 complex conjugate  j  √1undamped ζ0 pure imaginary no real partexponential growth ζ0 roots may be complex or real but the real part of s is always positive the first three cases are most important and the last two will be discussed only briefly in what follows case 1 the overdamped case ζ1in the overdamped case we have two real roots at for convenience we will refer to these as α and βand note that the transfer function may now be written asand the unit step response as we can look this form up as the asymptotic double exponential in the laplace transform table or do an inverse laplace transform using partial fraction expansion to get in terms of damping coefficient and natural frequency this becomes this is quite a complicated expression but note several things the final value as t→∞ is k the system gain this is also h 0 the inital value as t→0  is 0 this is also h ∞ wherever ω 0 occurs it is multiplied by t that means if we double ω 0 we double the speed of the system but dont change the shape of the response as ζ→∞ the second term in the numerator goes to zero and the system behaves as a first order system more on this later when we discuss the  dominant pole  approximation the effects of ζ and ω 0 on the shape of the response are discussed later case 2 the critically damped case ζ1to find the response of the critically damped case we proceed as with the overdamped case  for ζ1 the roots of the denominator of the transfer function are both at sω 0 so the transfer function can be written aswhich yields the step response this is the asymptotic critically damped form in the laplace transform table so we can note several characteristics of this response the final value as t→∞ is k the system gain this is also h 0 the inital value as t→0  is 0 this is also h ∞ wherever ω 0 occurs it is multiplied by t that means if we double ω 0 we double the speed of the system but dont change the shape of the response case 3 the underdamped case ζ1for the underdamped case we use the transfer function to find the step response in the laplace domainwe find this form in the laplace transform table prototype 2nd order lopass step response so there is a lot of information in this expression several important characteristics of the equation include the final value as t→∞ is k the system gain this is also h 0 the inital value as t→0  is 0 this is also h ∞ wherever ω 0 occurs it is multiplied by t that means if we double ω 0 we double the speed of the system but dont change the shape of the response the decay e ζω 0 t has time constant τ 1 ζω 0  the frequency of oscillation is called the damped frequency ω d for small ζ ω d ≈ω 0  for example if ζ02 ω d098ω 0 if ζ04 ω d092ω 0the topic of the effects of ζ and ω 0 on the shape of the response is an important one but is discussed later case 4 the undamped case ζ0when the damping coefficient is zero the system is said to be undamped the roots of the denominator of the transfer function are at s± j ω 0 so the transfer function iswhich give a step response this is a special case of the prototype 2nd order lopass step response form in the laplace transform table with ζ0 so we get as expected from the name the undamped system ζ0 has no damping and oscillates forever the graph below shows case 5 exponential growth ζ0if we consider the case where ζ is negative we can write the transfer function in terms of the two roots of the denominator of the transfer function we determine the unit step response by multiplying h s by 1s a unit step input and performing a partial fraction expansion assuming for now that α and β are not equal since the real parts of α and β are negative this solution grows exponentially as t increases if α and β are complex the solution oscillates as it grows for the types of systems we will discuss these types of systems are rare however they are important in the design of linear systems effects of gain ζ and ω 0 on second order lowpass step response the second order lowpass transfer function is given by the graph below shows the effect of ζ on the unit step response of a second order system for positive values of ζ with h 0lp 1 for ζ1 the system is overdamped and does not oscillate it also does not oscillate for ζ1 but for ζ1 the system is underdamped and oscillate more and more as ζ→0 some notes about this image that are true as long as ζ0 note that critical damping ζ1 does not cause any unexpected behavior this just reinforces the idea that critical damping is a special case mathematically but not in terms of the physical behavior of a system if h 0lp ≠1 the response scales with it ie if h 0lp doubles the amplitude of the response doubles this is not shown on the graph the initial value t0  is given by h ∞ so y γ 0  0 you can also show that the first derivative of y γ t is 0 at t0   the final value t→∞ is given by h 0 so y γ ∞1 the graph below shows the effect of ω 0 on the step response of a second order system as you can see the shape of the system is unchanged as ω 0 varies but the speed changes note that the amplitude of first second third peaks are equal independent of ω 0 only their timing changes as ω 0 increases the speed of the system increases if ω0 doubles the speed of the system doubles but ω 0 does not change the shape of the response this is because ω 0 and t always occur as a pair ω 0 ·t son increasing ω 0 simply increases the product ω 0 ·t at each value of t the graph below shows the effect of ζ on the step response of a second order system for positive and negative values of zeta for positive values of ζ the response decays with time for ζ0 there is no damping the system is said to be undamped for negative values of ζ the response actually grows with time we wont run into many situations like this but they can occur in certain situations in systems that have energy being added notice that the final value isnt defined when xxzeta0 step response of prototype second order highpass system the second order highpass systemhas many of the same characteristics as the second order lowpass with some differences as well similarities marked with  and differences marked with  to the lowpass response include  as xxzeta decreases system becomes less damped oscillates more  as xxomega0 increases system becomes faster this is not shown on the graph  if h 0lp ≠1 the response scales with it ie if h 0lp doubles the amplitude of the response doubles this is also not shown  the initial value t0  is still given by h ∞ but now y γ 0  1  the final value t→∞ is still given by h 0 but now y γ ∞0 step response of prototype second order bandpass system the second order bandpass systemhas many of the same characteristics as the second order lowpass and highpass with some differences as well similarities marked with  and differences marked with  to other second order responses include  as xxzeta decreases system becomes less damped oscillates more  as xxomega0 increases system becomes faster this is not shown on the graph  if h 0bp ≠1 the response scales with it ie if h 0bp doubles the amplitude of the response doubles this is also not shown  the initial value t0  is still given by h ∞ but now y γ 0  0  the final value t→∞ is still given by h 0 but now y γ ∞0 other second order systems other proper second order systems will have somewhat different step responses but some similarities marked with  and differences marked with  include  as xxzeta decreases system becomes less damped oscillates more  as xxomega0 increases system becomes faster this is not shown on the graph  if multiplied by a constant factor the response scales with it ie if the multiplier doubles the amplitude of the response doubles this is also not shown  the initial value t0  is still given by h ∞  the final value t→∞ is still given by h 0 step response of higher order systemsthe step responses of higher order systems are harder to generalize about for example a third order system can havethree distinct real rootsone pair of repeated real roots and one other distinct real roota single root repeated three times ora complex conjugate pair of root and a real root it becomes even more complicated for fourth order systems which can have repeated complex conjugate roots however even with higher order systems it is still often possible to make useful approximations to first or second order system the most common way to do that is to use the dominant pole approximation discussed below the dominant pole approximation reduction of a second order system to first order consider an overdamped second order system and its step response if the magnitude of β is very large compared to α typically if βα5 we will write write approximations for the transfer function and step response the approximation of the transfer function is perhaps not obvious at this point if you understand bode plots make plots of the exact and approximate functions  they are close to equal while the transfer function is large if you dont know bode plots dont worry  its not important here but the approximation of y γ t is straightforward the graph below left shows the exact step response red and the dominant pole approximation green for α1 and β5 though not a perfect match the exact and approximate responses are pretty close the polezero plot shows that the pole that we kept for our approximation ie the dominant pole is the one that is closer to the origin note one of the poles of the exact red system is hidden beneath that of the approximate green system if we increase β to 10 the approximation is even better the dominant pole is close relatively to the origin than in the previous case dominant pole approximation applied to higher order systems the dominant pole approximation can also be applied to higher order systems here we consider a third order system with one real root and a pair of complex conjugate roots in this case the test for the dominant pole compare α against ζω 0  this is because ζω 0 is the real part of the complex conjugate root we only compare the real parts of the roots when determining dominance because it is the real part that determines how fast the response decreases note that the dc gain of the exact system and the two approximate systems are equal in the examples below the second order pole has ζ04 and ω 0 1 which yields roots with a real part of 04 and an imaginary part of 092j there are three sets of graphs in all three graphs the exact response is in red the approximate response in which the first order pole is assumed to dominate is in green and the approximate response in which the second order poles are assumed to dominate is in blue in the first set of graphs α01 and the real pole dominates the response is very similar to a first order response the blue graph in which the second order poles are assumed to dominate is obviously a bad approximation looking at the bode plot it is clear that the exact and first order response are similar while the gain is substantial and only vary when the system is highly attenuating at high frequencies the polezero map shows that the real part of the first order response is much closer to zero than the real part of the complex conjugate poles in the second set of graphs α4 and the complex conjugate poles whose real part is much closer to the origin than that of the complex poles see polezero plot dominate the system response looks very much like the second order approximation and not much like the first order approximation note that the scale of these graphs is different than that of the previous set in the third set of graphs α04 and none of the poles are dominant and the resulting response is obviously more complicated than a simple first or second order response relationship of transient response frequency response transfer function and polezero
