htm 0105 ultrasonic activity test what is it this test checks to make sure that the ultrasonic activity in the tank is even and appropriate and that instruments within are being cleaned effectively htm 0105 ultrasonic activity test the test is performed by testing that the transducers beneath the bath are working efficiently and that instruments are being processed correctly during the cycle no matter where they are placed within the tank commonly known as the ‘foil test’ or ‘foil ablation test’ as the method usually involves using strips of foil there are other methods of performing the ultrasonic activity test such as wand meters however using foil strips evenly spaced throughout the tank remains the most economical and repeatable method what equipment and materials are required ultrasonic cleaner log book ultrasonic activity foil kit stopwatch d  day  w weekly  q  quarterly  y  yearly  cp d  competent person decontamination  eng  engineer when is it performed and by who document specific title reference installation  commission periodic testing d w q yhtm 0105 ultrasonic activity test 156green tick on greenpng supplier or engineerblue tick on bluepng cp d or engblue tick on bluepng cp d or engwhat is the procedure and passfail criteria document test procedure pass or fail criteria htm 01051 measure the depth of the empty tank2 cut nine strips of foil that is 120mm longer than the depth of the tank3 prepare the ultrasonic cleaner for use as the operator would routinely by adding water and the appropriate detergent4 degassing should also be performed5 the ultrasonic cleaner should achieve all the necessary startup requirements set out by the manufacturer and should be ready as if about to process loads as normal6 using the tape place a 3x3 grid across the top of the tank the tape should be positioned evenly spaced7 number each of the nine intersections the intersections should be numbered exactly the same each time the test is carried out so that test results can be compared at a later date if necessary8 take each foil strip and measure 120mm along the length9 roll up this length to weigh the strip in the solution each strip should now be the same length as the depth of the tank10 measure 10mm from the other end of the foil strip and fold into an ‘l’ shape11 attach a foil strip to each of the nine numbered intersections the rolled up end should be facing downwards12 the manufacturer should provide a length of time to operate the cycle for this test this can vary between 30 seconds and 10 minutes if there is no timer in the unit use a stopwatch for timing13 once the cycle has completed carefully remove the foil strips and blotdry14 the numbered position of each strip should be noted when filing the strips in the ultrasonic cleaners log book performing the test on a smaller ultrasonic cleaner although nine strips of foil are specified in the htm 0105 test procedure isopharm have found that this can be too much for smaller tanks if the test is being performed on an ultrasonic cleaner with a tank 15 litres or less isopharm recommend that the following amendments are made to the steps in the htm 0105 test procedure2 cut four strips of foil that is 120mm longer than the depth of the tank6 using the tape place a 2x2 grid across the top of the tank the tape should be positioned evenly spaced7 number each of the four intersections the intersections should be numbered exactly the same each time the test is carried out so that test results can be compared at a later date if necessary11 attach a foil strip to each of the four numbered intersections the rolled up end should be facing downwards the test is a pass if all strips of foil are eroded uniformly the heaviest erosion should typically match the position of the baskets normally placed in the tank when processing loads the erosion pattern should be consistent with each test carried out deviation from normal erosion patterns may indicate transducer failure the test is a fail if no erosion takes place or if there is significant change in the erosion pattern when results are compared with previously undertaken ultrasonic activity tests related items aluminium foil reel£2110 exc vatread more aluminium foil test kit£5070 exc vatread more welzyme detergent sachets£4960 exc vatread more contact us to discuss your requirements please contact isopharm telephone01709 52 52 56contact isopharm ask an expert unsure of any area of healthcare compliance we can answer your questions sign up to our best practiceemail newsletter read more free validation test schedule ensure you are testing correctly to remain htm 0105 compliant training click here to visit our elearning and training website
