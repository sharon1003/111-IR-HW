is galvanized steel harmful to the soil could the biodigester which is galvanized steel leach out zinc and be harmful to the garden soil in my last post i discussed a new method of worm composting mentioned on the internet it is called a biodigester and involves planting a small galvanized steel trash can with holes drilled into the soil about 36 inches after i started to think about it i wondered if the chemicals from the steel would leach into the soil galvanized steel is made using zinc i don’t want to put anything into my garden which could be harmful a few years ago i wanted to build raised beds using treated lumber i purchased the lumber and had it cut for the raised beds and then realized that the chemicals in the wood could leach out into the soil so i never used it if you are looking for an alternative to a galvanized steel planter you could click on this picture for a nice selfwatering planter after researching on the internet i found a site called wwwfinishingcom and a forum discussing the poisonous aspects of galvanized steel mostly there are questions from people who work with making galvanized steel but here and there i found questions about using it in the garden since they are spaced throughout the page i copied the relevant questions and pasted them below if you click on the link above you can read through the whole forum may 28 2009hi ted i have a question – i put galvanized fencing around my strawberry patch to keep the birds out and i’m wondering if that’s unsafe could zinc leach into the soil etc in a previous post you stated that galvanized metal is not safe for food but you also said that it’s okay for bath water thanks in advance for your responsecatherine chandler – orrville ohio——————————————————————————– may 29 2009hi catherine galvanized fencing is fine when we say it’s not foodsafe we mean you should not cook in zinc pots or serve food out of zinc containers because of the possibility of acidic food or drink dissolving the zinc and you consuming too much of it zinc is not poison cold prevention tablets are one example of the deliberate consumption of zinc regards ted mooney p e finishingcom brick new jersey april 6 2010i would like to make balcony veggie garden boxes made from galvanized metal these boxes will match the house will the zinc leach into my soil and poison my vegetables catherine harley – boulder colorado ——————————————————————————– april 6 2010hi catherine no it won’t regards ted mooney p e finishingcom brick new jersey october 12 2010 i see people using galvanized metal containers to grow vegetables with water containing chlorides salts fertilizers containing salts and eloctrolysis in the ground i am wondering where the metals etc are going when they dissolve is this not a hazard to eat food grown this way some even “line the galvanized container but guarantee not to corrode for 8 years so am i consuming heavy metals for 8 years until i replace the container thanks alex kallas sustainable agriculture educator – vista california usa——————————————————————————– october 12 2010hi alex the mdr for zinc is 15 mg and it is fairly common to take 100 mg per day for short periods to help ward off colds and flu although it is bad for welders to breathe zinc fumes and it may be bad to put acidic foods into contact with zinc zinc is not plutonium farm animals eat and drink out of galvanized troughs all the time and in rural areas people collect rainwater from galvanized roofs it will take years for all of the galvanizing to dissolve into the soil probably decades more for all of it to be taken up into the plants then much of the plant will be thrown away or composted and only a fraction eaten i doubt that the vegetables have much chance of providing your mdr let alone deterring colds the term “heavy metals” is often used in an alarmist context and it can be obfuscatory because it implies commonality between the dangers from tin iron gold and zinc on the one hand with cadmium lead and mercury on the other regards ted mooney p e finishingcom brick new jersey so it seems that it would be allright to bury the trash can as suggested in the online course so my next step would be to find proper drill bits to drill in metal one great thing about this trash can is the lid fits very tightly so that no wildlife can get into the compost for a nice dinner do you have
