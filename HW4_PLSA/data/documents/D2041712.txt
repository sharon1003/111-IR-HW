the great year of the chinese zodiac consists of one year for each of the twelve signs 2017 is the year of the rooster considered to be honorable and upstanding roosters chinese astrology describes you as resilient brave loyal a hard worker astute a fashionable dresser charming and witty complex creative and artistic you are drawn to religious and spiritual studies especially regarding healing problem solving is your special talent the rooster animal from the chinese astrology is said to correspond with the western sign of virgo the rooster is often associated with the sun since it crows at dawn the sun is the “king” of our solar system and the giver of light heat and life the rooster is also a “king” in his proud mannerisms – and remember his comb is a builtin crown thus the rooster conveys the impression of leadership of high attainment especially in the arts and sciences of exalted character and enlightened insight in some representations of the sun the chinese will place a rooster among the virtues assigned to this sign you will also find high skills in management and sedate deportment roosters are alert to opportunities and often can see far into the distant horizon for chances to show their leadership abilities and as leaders roosters can be selfless in that they will never ask more from others than they themselves are willing to give while rooster employers can be hard taskmasters they always have the well being of their employees at heart – even if their only goal is advancement of their personal business interestsroosters are extremely confident in their abilities and like to crow about it to others while being aware of your own ability is one thing constantly parading your achievements in front of others can become irritating but irritation rarely stops or slows down a rooster – they are only interested in getting on with thingsrooster natives enjoy display and are often the life of the party in both appearance and behavior they relish celebrations of all sorts and frequently act as hosts since their success in business brings them a measure of prosperity roosters strive to always win and often do both at work and at play the best time of day for roosters is dusk 500 pm to 700 pm when they can rest after a long day of exercising leadership and displaying themselves similarly they prefer the later months of the year when the sun sets early and the grain has been harvested this is the time when the rooster can reenergize before beginning another busy dayread the 2017 chinese horoscope for your zodiac sign general predictions for the year of the rooster 2017january 28 2017 to february 15 2018 is marked in the lunar calendar as the year of the fire rooster a period when the fiery temperament of the rooster is expected to infuse more enthusiasm and energy into our activities increasing hopes for better prospects for everyone how will the rooster year compare to the previous year of the monkey2016 the year of the fire monkey has been marked by ambition dynamism and a thirst for adventure as we had noted however in 2017 we need to brace ourselves for a period of immense changes fire destroys metal and this destructive relationship means challenges double during the year yet the fire rooster shines like a bright star in the dark sky bringing hope and transformation to those who know how to act harmoniously around prevailing circumstances consider a rooster in a barnyard protecting his hens and strutting his stuff feathers puffed up head high and extremely proud of his flock well that’s about it the year of the rooster will be a year that the most vital promise made will result in a flawless job no matter what it takes to achieve it it will be a year when it is truly better to do less but do it perfectly perched precariously out on a limb the rooster is a cheerful and buoyant early bird a don quixote who is tempted by the spirit of adventure he can bring a few wild goose chases that don’t quite work out independence and equality will characterize relationships very dramatic theatrical presentations books and movies will honor the classics old stories are retold and appreciated too much eccentricity and originality is met with suspect roosters are brave and chivalrous and when faced with stress opposition and adversity will go far beyond what is required to win the battle the stubborn rooster will be a dauntless hero who will not back down and who will certainly be unreasonable if he doesn’t get his way the year of the rooster teaches the lessons of order scrutiny and strategic planning the sage advice of sunzi which is still taught in modern military circles advises one to “achieve psychological advantage over the adversary and use force only as a last resort” i think we can all take heart of that advice in 2017 the year when diplomacy winsrooster is a very fertile bird therefore the chinese horoscope 201 prophesizes to be just as such you can expect a pleasant addition to your household in case you are still single this will be the best time to find the love of your life and form a family of your own writes valery ledovsky there will be an abundance of romantic dates in the upcoming year of the rooster roosters are also communal birds that is why year of the rooster 2017 predictions promises to be a lucky one for joint ventures notes the chinese predictions the chinese horoscope 2017 suggests signing as many business contracts as possible and form new partnerships in the upcoming year your circle of friends will definitely expand next year however no matter the business family interests should always come firstthe rooster is the first creature to awake in the morning and wakes up the others with crowing time to get up and get on with it the rooster personality is upfront and focused their forthright nature will not make roosters the best diplomats however you can count on their thorough approach and attention to detail to get the job done we associate the qualities of sharpness and precision with the qi energy of the rooster as its essence is the metal element in a rooster year we will hear more cutting criticisms of those in the public life and feathers might well fly as prides are dented nevertheless all will benefit from the rude awakening despite a fuss and a flap we can expect to prudence to be the key in economic matters for the rooster is a good money manager the optimism of the rooster year overlaps the year of the rooster but the rooster tends to be overconfident and is prone to come up with nonsensical plans while the colorful rooster brings bright and happy days he also dissipates energy better stick to practical and wellproven paths forget about that controversial best seller you were going to write no get rich quick schemes this year please”the 2017 chinese zodiac forecasts that it may require a great deal of effort this year to resist going off on wild goose chases refrains from making speculative ventures disappointments and conflicts will result the rooster likes to flaunt his authority and a lot of trouble can come from his domineering attitude but since he also symbolizes the good administrator and conscientious overseer of justice in the barnyard the peace wil still be kept everything will be precariously balanced in the rooster’s year as his dramatic personality can set off all kinds of petty disputes this year we may have to expend maximum effort for minimum gain try not to fuss too much details do need looking into but don’t forget to view the whole picture be cautious do not aim too high one is liable to get shot down general confidence may lead to new and daring ventures the year of the rooster 2017 heralds happiness color and drama but this has to be balanced with good old fashioned common sense and tried and tested values otherwise it could end up becoming a wild goose chase conflicts may come up but will dissipate if we put ourselves in each others shoes otherwise the administrator can turn dictator which may not go over very well in the barnyard the motto for the year of the rooster 2017 should be kiss keep it simple and dont take offense at the slightest provocation theres a chinese saying if you take a step back you will find the sea and the sky is boundless remember good values never go out of style no matter how hard it may seem to apply them he who dares will have plenty to crow about in the end with the pockets none too light at that – a perfect challenge for the rooster in all of us in the year of the rooster 2017 we will hear more cutting criticisms of those in the public life and feathers might well fly as prides are dented nevertheless all will benefit from the rude awakening despite a fuss and a flap we can

goldattheendoftherainbow dreams don’t reach for the sky come down to earth and dig up gold from your back yard advise you the chinese horoscope 2017 politically the year of the rooster 2017 it is a year when most nations will adhere to hardline policies governments around the world will puff up like the rooster flexing muscles and making threats but probably not following through unless faced with no other solution most nations will be most concerned with protecting the homeland and unfortunately it will be a year when most leaders and countrymen will take offense over the smallest thing the united states of america was born under the sign cancer and during the year of the monkey making this a more moderate and stable time to pursue what it has set out to do it will be an exhausting year for the u s ending with commitments that will have to be fulfilled the year of the rooster 2017 is a year when the u s must not underestimate its opponents canada also being born under the sign cancer but during the year of the rabbit is heading into a difficult time as the economy tightens and funds dwindle this is truly a time to join forces with others to ease the stress the united kingdom is a capricornmonkey so therefore will continue to side with the u s they will find this a rather exhausting and perilous year on the home front see the 2017 chinese zodiac predictions for your animal sign the year of the phoenix 2017 sometimes the year of the rooster is translated as the year of the phoenix or the year of the chicken phoenix is used because it is a more spiritual translation with the potential for personal evolution should the spiritual journey of transformation become too challenging in 2017 then you revert to the role of rooster or chicken resisting change and scratching and pecking for every grub and worm so strive to keep your beak to the wind and consciously seek ways to grow and transform but facing your fears to be reborn is not always easy therefore the year of the phoenix 2017 is a time of conscientiousness hard work discipline and a realistic outlook practical endeavors succeed nonsensical plans do not be a bit frugal financially and refrain from complaining choose your battles wisely because there could be much crowing and pecking this year keep to the high ground and do not engage in petty arguments keep life simple those born in phoenix years 1909 1921 1933 1945 1957 1969 1981 1993 2005 2017 are sharp people who are equipped with keen judgment and a quick wit phoenixes are so smart and flexible that they can be thrown into any situation on a moment’s notice and emerge a winner they can predict the direction of any circumstance and act accordingly they are great schemers and planners phoenixes are different unique and stand out in a crowd they often make personal fashion statements and love to exhibit their plumage phoenix folks take pride in working hard and following the rules they don’t waste time – or money – and can be contemptuous of those who do they are perfectionists who care what other people think and they want to be praised for doing a splendid job but if their work ethic is taken to the extreme they can become fussy critical and controlling phoenixes benefit by holding back their criticisms not judging too hastily and releasing the desire to dominate others and always be in the right if spiritually inclined phoenix people can develop prophetic abilities the highest manifestation of the phoenix individual is to become like a phoenix the mystical bird that epitomizes grace and beauty just as the phoenix rose from the ashes to create new life the mystically inclined phoenix can overcome all obstacles and create opportunities for new beginnings the choice is yours phoenix correlates
