posted about her sooty having a snotty nose as well we have pretty much come to the conclusion it was caused by the dryness dust please log in or create an account to join the conversationreggit

but the front end has cleared up i was once told that it was one of the many symptoms of cobalt shortage so if you havent done it recently a multimineral drench  not an anthelmintic unless they are skinny and pooey would not harm them please log in or create an account to join the conversation isla offlinevalued contributor posts 8754thank you received 008 may 2008 1342 193502tigger166057 wrote probably best otherwise newbies will stop asking questions for fear of being made fun of fun not intended the comment was really in line with a conversation i was having with ronnie yesterday about the number of people who acquire animals before making much attempt to find out about their basic requirements or behaviour the comment was not actually directed at anyone on here but both of us read with alarm some us discussion boards where this is often the case with horrible animal welfare consequences rather than attempt to dissuade people from asking questions id like to continue to encourage more selfdirected research about animals which would go a long way toward answering some of the more basic concerns about them which often show up in questions here as you will no doubt be aware the theyre all going to die comment is by way of a joke about sheep which seem only to wait to think up different ways to confound all our efforts and die it is also true they will die some time i have personally found that sheep with care vaccinations and shepherding dont die very often at all i have a nearly11yearold wether who might very well do so in the next few days or he might go on

received 008 may 2008 1452 193519to try and answer the orginal query my entire flock at some stage in the last couple of months have had what is described abovesnotty noses and sneezing and some of them a cough last year i had the same problem and the year before that now all but a few have recovered all on their own and the ones still a bit snotty will come right too i think last year they came right on their own too but i was advised to give them a drench for lungworm last year as they were coughing quite badly so all i can gather from this is that it is a seasonal thing and is quite normal and generally not life threatening i would be just keeping an eye on them and if any look a bit down as in miserable maybe get the vet out then just to be sure i have found sheep are quite hardy as long as they are generally healthy and well fed i have only ever had two deaths here other than the many put in the freezer and the few very young lambs that have died over the years one got sleepy sickness and another had a bearing so she was humanely destroyed good luckplease log in or create an account to join the conversationjeannielea offlinevalued contributor posts 2533thank you received 2908 may 2008 1620 193551a dose of cider vinegar might give them a bit of a boost even if its a seasonal thing we add a liquid mineral mix cant remember the name but its seaweed extract stuff and

romneys are snotty as hellthey steal the calf meal dust and root out every little scrap of vegetation even when surrounded by grass i think sheep have a fault in their neural connections yesterday i had to rescue a sheep on on one of the farms i work on it had got its head stuck in some sheep netting and turned itself upside downstupid thing was it was in a paddock of knee high grass and had put its head through to graxe on a couple of stubbly bits of paspalum and blackberrryand it was still trying to go forward sigpic sigpic baaaaaaaaaplease log in or create an account to join the

one type of humour no tigger i wouldnt expect to find too much if i googled snotty sheep but i would not expect to however i may find something under nasal discharge nasal discharge is a common occurance and rarely related to any illness it tends to be seasonal  autumnwinter and springsummer  and doesnt affect all sheep it is not a disease and usually nothing to be concerned about it will run its course in areas where bot fly is a problem they will often lay their eggs in the nasal passages of sheep which result in a pus like discharge and extreme discomfort for the sheep occasionally infection will result which requires antibiotics cheers ronnie please log in or create an account to join the conversationfleetwoodmac topic author offlinelsb member posts 55thank you received 009 may
