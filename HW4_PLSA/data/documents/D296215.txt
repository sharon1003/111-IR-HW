july 30 2013  20 comments top 5 most advanced robotic lawn mowers if you don’t search you’ll not find the best autonomous robotic lawn mower to have a healthy lawn at home more than that these wonderful tools for gardening works for an unlimited period of time without your intervention if you’re here probably you want to spend less time cutting the grass and more on drinking coffee and beer you’re lucky in this post you’ll find top five most advanced robotic lawn mowers available on the market for each mower i’ll explore the most important features like navigation working area or the operating mode first of all these robotic mowers have similar characteristics with the traditional gas mowers a lawn mower robot is guided by sensors while an algorithm controls the robot to cover the entire lawn surface in another article i already explain how an autonomous robotic lawn mower works i discovered a long list of advantages as well as disadvantages of these smart mechanical agents but in the end only one thing counts – the robot should cut the grass at the correct specification honda miimo honda miimo honda is a wellknown presence in the robotics field especially with asimo – the humanoid robot released in 2000 the japanese company extends its tentacles in the domestic area with a service robot called miimo miimo was designed for minimal interaction between human and technology with high benefits in time and effort the basic idea of this robot is to do repetitive tasks for a long time period so the honda’s service robot is designed to cut the grass continuously for an unlimited time in a single pass the robot cuts around 23 mm of grass in one single day is able to cover a surface of 2200 square meters or 3000 square meters the coverage depends on the version chosen the cutting system uses durable blades to cut the grass in small parts the cutting grass is dispersed in the land as a natural fertilizer the robot does not have a cutting collector for grass like a traditional lawn mower the cutting blades could be adjustable between 20 and 60 millimeters honda miimo is an autonomous robot that can operate in three modes random directional and mixed in random mode the robot navigates without a pattern in the directional mode it moves back and front to ensure a faster cut while in the mixed mode miimo works on intervals in random and directional mode the navigation system includes an installed perimeter wire located at ground level to not be affected by the blades when the sensor of the robot senses the electrical signal in the wire it changes the direction in the perimeter another set of sensors scans the environment at 360 degrees to detect obstacles if the sensors detect any solid object the robot turns around when the battery is low miimo navigates to the recharging station for its own security the robot has integrated an automatic shutdown system with unique pin for the restart husqvarna automower 265 acxhusqvarna automower 265 acxautomower 265 acx is an autonomous robotic lawn mower designed to be used on maximum areas of 6000 square meters it has a wide range of sensors that help the robot to navigate in a wide area it has integrated lift tilt and sensors to detect obstacles compared with other robotic lawn mowers husqvarna automower 265 acx has an interesting feature that sends text messages in case of any disturbance in operation inside the 265 acx robot is powered by a liion battery with a working time on a full charge of 80 minutes just if you want to know a complete recharge takes 40 minutes it cuts the grass with 5 pivoting razor blades at a height between 20 and 60 millimeters in the case of the cutting blades are shutting off the alarm system announce the owner to power on the user needs to introduce a pin code for authentication robomow rs630robomow rs630robomow rs630 is a powerful lawn mower robot with autonomous navigation in addition the robot can be remotely controlled in case that the automatic mode cannot reach small places like all the other automatic lawn mowers rs630 comes with a charging station to recharge the battery or wait to start the program in the case of a low battery rs630 return to the charging station to recharge the battery and then it navigate at the same place where it remained the robot can cover a maximum surface of 3000 square meters it can be operated easily by following the instructions displayed on the lcd screen located on the back the working perimeter is surrounded by wire and activated from the base station in the case of perimeter wire malfunction the robot enters in sleep mode and stop operating equipped with different sensors the lawn robot detects obstacles and changes the direction john deere tango e5john deere tango e5in agriculture john deere sets standards as one of the biggest agricultural machinery manufacturers in robotics john deere is trying to introduce the new autonomous robot called tango e5 the mower robot is fully autonomous and designed for operations in any weather and heavy conditions on the land tango e5 operates under a random path surrounded by a boundary wire john deere designs the robot for surfaces of up to 1800 square meters and gardens where a long list of obstacles may interfere with the robot a wide range of sensors are attached to the robot and programmed to keep away the device by obstacles safety is another category where john deere excels if the robot is working on slopes of more than 35 degrees the robot stops in addition a large stop button is attached to the robot for a manual emergency shutdown john deere tango e5 has available a series of preprograms for a good lawn maintenance a charging station is used for recharging the battery when the battery is almost done or wait to start the next program bosch indego bosch indego indego is an autonomous lawn mower robot with an intelligent navigation system called logicut a smart navigation system doesn’t mean just navigating to the charging station and cutting the grass in a delimited space logicut is an advanced navigation system that calculates the shortest route measure the garden area and mow the lawn in parallel lines for an optimal cover of the entire surface bosch indigo has a design that allowing operation in different weather conditions and on slopes of maximum 35 degrees the robot can be used for lands up to 1000 square meters compared with other mower robots this is a small area and the biggest disadvantage of this robot thanks for reading and before you go… if you found this article
