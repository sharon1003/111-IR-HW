mad sci network environment query re how much co2 does a human exhale date sun sep 26 215153 2004 posted by steve mack postdocfellow molecular and cell biology area of science environment id 1095871322 en message hi sopacthis is an interesting question that is hard to answer accurately i recently answered a question that was related to this one 1070824959 bc so i thought i would take a crack at answering this one from the previous answer you can see that we produce 6 moles of co2 for every 6 moles of o2 that we consume in addition we know that we consume about 300 ml of o2 per minute 310 for the average man and 260 for the average woman resting using the ideal gas law detailed in the previous answer we know that the one mole of any gas will take up 224 liters of volume at 1 atmosphere of pressure and about 273 kelvin this means that the same volume of co2 about 300 ml per minute will be released in addition we can calculate the mass of co2 exhaled per minute the ideal gas law tells us that a person consumes about 00120014 moles of o2 per minute we know that the molecular weight of co2 is 440095 120107 for carbon  2159994 for oxygen so that they are exhaling between 05 and 06 grams of co2 per minute remember that these numbers are for the socalled basal metabolism and they go up depending on the level of activity but this should give you a baseline from which to extrapolate there are 1440 minutes in a day so that is 074 to 088 kilograms per person per day and multiplied by 6 billion 3 billion adult men and 3 billion adult women that comes to 48 billion kilograms per day now this is only a rough estimate the solubilities of o2 and co2 in the blood are different so the ratio of inhalaed o2 to exhaled co2 might not be exactly 1 the average daily oxygen consumption is likely much higher since most people dont spend the entire 24 hours in a day sitting around resting finally the number 6 billion includes a lot of children who werent included in these calculations good luck i hope this helpscurrent queue  current queue for environment  environment archives try the links in the mad sci library for more information on environment  mad sci home  information  search  random knowledge generator  mad sci archives  mad library  mad labs  mad faqs  ask a   join us  help support mad sci mad sci network webadminwwwmadsciorg Â© 19952003 all rights reserved
