was depicted on two early bronze coins of the roman republic the sextans and the semuncia 6mercury portrait on a bronze semuncia 215–211 bcsyncretism  editwhen they described the gods of celtic and germanic tribes rather than considering them separate deities the romans interpreted them as local manifestations or aspects of their own gods a cultural trait called the interpretatio romana mercury in particular was reported as becoming extremely popular among the nations the roman empire conquered julius caesar wrote of mercury being the most popular god in britain and gaul regarded as the inventor of all the arts 7 this is probably because in the roman syncretism mercury was equated with the celtic god lugus and in this aspect was commonly accompanied by the celtic goddess rosmerta although lugus may originally have been a deity of light or the sun though this is disputed similar to the roman apollo his importance as a god of trade made him more comparable to mercury and apollo was instead equated with the celtic deity belenus 4romans associated mercury with the germanic god wotan by interpretatio romana 1stcentury roman writer tacitus identifies him as the chief god of the germanic peoples 8names and epithets  editmercury is known to the romans as mercurius and occasionally in earlier writings as merqurius mirqurios or mircurios had a number of epithets representing

referred to as the lares invisible household gods temple  editmercurys temple in rome was situated in the circus maximus between the aventine and palatine hills and was built in 495 bc 12that year saw disturbances at rome between the patrician senators and the plebeians which led to a secession of the plebs in the following year at the completion of its construction a dispute emerged between the consuls appius claudius sabinus regillensis and publius servilius priscus structus as to which of them should have the honour of dedicating the temple the senate referred the decision to the popular assembly and also decreed that whichever was chosen should also exercise additional duties including presiding over the markets establish a merchants guild and exercising the functions of the pontifex maximus the people because of the ongoing public discord and in order to spite the senate and the consuls instead awarded the honour of dedicating the temple to the senior military officer of one of the legions named marcus laetorius the senate and the consuls in particular the conservative appius were outraged at this decision and it inflamed the ongoing situation 13the dedication occurred on 15 may 495 bc 14the temple was regarded as a fitting place to worship a swift god of trade and travel since it was a major center of commerce as well as a racetrack since it stood between the plebeian stronghold on the aventine and the patrician center on the palatine it also emphasized the role of mercury as a mediator  citation neededworship  editbecause mercury was not one of the early deities
