g cla beginning on d 7 of gestation to determine whether pre and postnatal cla affects short and longterm growth and adiposity at weaning d 21 progeny were assigned control or cla diet and fed until 11 wk of age at birth litter size and weight were not different between treatments there were age and sexdependent changes in inguinal adipose fatty acid composition at birth and weaning whereas there were no differences in lipid accretion or adipocyte proliferation at weaning cla did not alter inguinal adipocyte proliferation but increased  p  001 ccaatenhancer binding protein α expression in inguinal adipose tissue from females whereas there was no difference in expression in males significant differences in size distribution of inguinal adipocytes at weaning and retroperitoneal adipocytes at 11 wk of age were observed in general cla increased the proportion of smaller cells and decreased the proportion of larger cells the main longterm effect of the dams diet was the significantly heavier gastrocnemius and soleus muscles and significantly longer tail lengths an indication of skeletal growth of male pups whose dams were fed cla postweaning diet reduced fat pad weights in female but not male pups fed cla this response was due to differences in cell size rather than number response to cla treatment may depend on the sex and age of the animal as well as duration of feedingconjugated linoleic acid gestation lactation adipogenesis imprinting rats growth and development are greater during the fetal and neonatal periods than at any other time of an animals life numerous studies support the fetal programming hypothesis ie that during these critical periods health and disease risk in later life are programmed  1 – 3  this suggests that fetal life has farreaching consequences influencing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes and obesity numerous studies have also correlated birth weight and size with maternal nutrition combined these studies indicate that maternal diet may affect size at birth and therefore alter risks for chronic disease in adulthood one particular chronic disease obesity is of special interest because of its high prevalence and its correlation with adverse health status this farreaching problem is not limited to humans decreasing profit margins in animal production and increased health concerns are creating demands for improved production of high quality meat products nutrient partitioning during the rapid growth phases of gestation and lactation may be key to understanding how growth can be manipulated to achieve a more favorable body composition for animal and human health unfortunately the development and methods of management of obesity are still debated fat tissue develops during fetal life and its development can be manipulated the intricate regulation of adipocyte development is a result of the actions of many factors including hormones glucocorticoids growth factors and transcription of various genes  4  dietary manipulation can alter the activity of these factors fetally and postnatally thus altering adipose development  5 6  there are also numerous in vivo and in vitro studies showing that fetal and neonatal adipocyte development is affected by exposure to these factors  7 8  thus it is possible that maternal diet during gestation and lactation may alter adipose tissue development in the offspring which may have longlasting effects on the growth of this tissue and therefore the development of obesity this would have substantial implications for both human health and animal production the next obvious prerequisite is to determine which dietary manipulations favorably alter adipose development one nutrient that has been receiving much attention on the basis of its potential to repartition body mass in growing animals is conjugated linoleic acid cla 3 recent studies with cla indicate that it alters body composition in growing animals cla is a group of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid although naturally occurring cla content in foods and feeds can be manipulated through processing diet alteration and supplementation with cla in both milk products and meat  9 – 12  initial interest in this group of compounds seems to have stemmed from its anticarcinogenic activity  13  subsequent studies have shown that feeding cla can also improve atherosclerosis  14 and glucose tolerance  15  alter immune function  16 and vitamin storage  17  change body composition in mice  18  rats  19 and pigs  20  and alter milk composition in several species  9 10 21 22  some of these changes may be a result of incorporation into adipose tissue and subsequent specific changes in the activity of this dynamic tissue recent studies have noted significant changes at both the tissue and cellular levels in vitro studies of cell lines exposed to cla suggest that adipocyte development may be limited by decreasing proliferation andor differentiation of these cells  23 24  altering adipose tissue with small amounts of a naturally occurring compound has therapeutic potential in humans and offers opportunities to improve efficiency in animal production critical development occurs during fetal and neonatal growth therefore increased cla during pregnancy and lactation could alter body composition and adipocyte development in both the mother and the offspring this experiment was designed to determine whether prenatal effects of cla on fat and growth in spraguedawley rats are associated with previously reported postnatal effects such as decreased adiposity and increased growth rate more specifically the goal of this study was to determine whether exposure to cla during the time of adipocyte development in the fetus and neonate reduced the potential for adiposity later in life materials and methodsanimals and diet timed pregnant spraguedawley rats harlan madison wi were obtained on d 7 of

inguinal adipose tissue were collected at weaning and 50 mg of rp adipose tissue were collected at d 77 for determination of total cell number and cell size distribution as described by hirsch and gallian  27  although previous work in rats fed cla showed minimal changes in inguinal adipose depot cellularity this is the only depot large enough to dissect at weaning and thus was used to determine cellularity at weaning  26  the rp adipose depot was used to determine adipose cellularity because previous work has shown this depot to be responsive to dietary cla briefly adipose tissue

effect of sex on serum chol or ffa but males regardless of treatment had significantly higher serum concentrations of tg than did females discussionone of the most prominent effects of cla on body composition of growing animals is a reduction in body fat the goal of this study was to investigate the effects of maternal cla consumption on growth and development of adipose tissue of pups during gestation and lactation this study is unique in that the dams cla intake was manipulated and both long and shortterm effects on pup growth and development were studied maternal cla intake began during early gestation to investigate its effects when present at the onset of adipose tissue development changes in adipose cell size but not number were evident in claexposed litters by weaning 21 d with a significant reduction in fat pad mass of females but not males at 11 wk of age  tables 2 and 4  inguinal adipose tissue from pups in claexposed litters at 21 d of age contained significantly greater levels of both the 9 cis 11 trans and the 10 trans 12 cis isomers of cla at the same time adipocytes from the inguinal adipose tissue of claexposed pups showed distinct differences in cell size distributions cebpα expression and fatty acid composition but no differences in the rate of cell proliferation a dramatic sixfold increase in cebpα protein levels of claf suggests that these adipocytes have an increased capacity for differentiation these results are in contrast to a lack of change in cebpα m rna in 3t3l1 adipocytes exposed to varying levels of the trans 10 cis 12 cla isomer  29  this may be due to inherent differences between in vivo and in vitro studies or to the use of pure isomers in the in vitro studies cebpα activates the transcription of several genes expressed when preadipocytes differentiate resulting in the adipocyte phenotype in addition to its transcription activator role one isoform of cebpα 42 k da may also suppress clonal expansion because it has been shown to limit mitotic activity in 3t3l1 adipocyte cell lines  30  however this phenomenon was not apparent in the present experiment proliferation of inguinal adipose cells and total fat cell number per inguinal pad were not different in cla and confed pups initially these results seem contradictory how could cla increase the adipocyte phenotype the expression of cebpα while decreasing total body fat a possible answer lies in the size distribution of adipocytes at weaning claexposed rats had markedly fewer “large adipocytes” in the size range of 80–140 μ m with an increased number of “smaller adipocytes” in the range of 40–60 μ m these results are similar to those recently reported in growing spraguedawley rats fed cla  19  collectively these results suggest that dietary cla shifts the pattern of adipocyte differentiation and results in earlier differentiation of adipocytes thereby limiting their size and storage of triacylglycerides resulting in a decrease in body fat this is supported by the suppression of triacylglyceride accumulation in 3t3l1 adipocyte cell cultures exposed to cla isomers  31  it is of interest that the changes in cebpα expression occurred in females but not in males at weaning this change in a cellular protein which is partly responsible for adipocyte differentiation seems to predict the differential size distribution in rp adipocytes at 77 d of age when again there was a decrease in larger adipocytes and an increase in smaller adipocytes these changes however were not limited to the cellular level when littermates were compared at 77 d of age differences in adipose tissue mass were observed in females but not in males after feeding of the pups through 11 wk of age remarkable sex differences were noted in regards to the main effects of the maternal and postweaning cla diets in females the main effect of cla in the postweaning diet was to reduce the weight of the rp and pm fat pads the changes in body composition and growth in females were markedly different from those in males where the main effect of cla in the maternal diet was to increase the weights of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles as well as increase the tail length cla also increased the weight of the soleus muscle when present in the postweaning diet this indicates that cla increased lean tissue mass and skeletal growth in male but not female progeny previous work  21 has indicated that progeny of fisher dams fed cla during gestation and lactation had improved feed efficiency this observation was confirmed in male offspring of spraguedawley dams in the present study this study is the first to demonstrate that longterm effects of dietary cla on body composition changes are due in part to sexdependent changes in fat mass and lean tissue mass these results raise the possibility that cla may interact either directly or indirectly with sexdependent characteristics resulting in body composition changes this is supported by several other studies which have indicated that response to cla may be sex dependent one in vitro study showed that cla added to mcf7 human breast cancer cells inhibited proliferation of cells with estrogen receptors more than in those with no receptors  32  moyacamarena et al  33 also reported that hepatic peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor pparresponsive genes of female rats responded less to cla than did those of male rats this paper and other previously published studies report that dietary cla changes the fatty acid composition of various tissues in different animal models including neonatal chicks  34 35  it has been concluded that due to its structural similarity to linoleic acid cla decreases steroylco a desaturase enzyme activity and gene expression thus changing membrane fatty acid composition  29 36  it has been shown that changes in dietary fatty acids can alter the fatty acid composition of adipocyte membranes  37  adipocytes and fibroblasts  38  furthermore the changes in membrane fatty acids are associated with significant changes in insulin responsive cellular activities including glucose transport and lipogenesis  39  a previous example of this is the report of improved insulinstimulated glucose transport in adipocytes from rats fed a fish oil diet high in polyunsaturated fats  40  these responses are also similar to those seen by houseknecht et al  15 who reported that in diabetic zucker rats dietary cla improves glucose tolerance although serum insulin levels of rats in the present study were not altered by dietary cla they were not deprived of food before blood collection and showed no overt signs of diabetes both the changes in adipocyte membrane fatty acid composition and increased differentiation may result in varied responses of cell receptors to their ligands potentially altering adipocyte response to sex hormones igf and insulin all of which have been shown to influence adipocyte development although the role of sex hormones in adipose tissue development is poorly understood regional differences between sexes have been described suggesting a role for sex hormones several methods including ligand blotting and sequencing have verified that receptors for both androgens and estrogens are present in adipose tissue  41 42  pederson et al  41 reported that mature adipocytes have estrogen glucocorticoid and androgen receptors but not progesterone receptors whereas only glucocorticoid and androgen receptors are present in preadipocytes this may be one of the reasons why sex hormones elicit very different responses in vitro where addition of androgens antagonized adipogenesis and estrogens enhanced adipogenesis  43  however it has also been shown that the lack of estrogen is adipogenic in ovariectomized rats and may suppress lipoprotein lipase  44  the activity of estrogen receptors on rat adipocytes has been characterized intensively and shows interesting results studies have shown that insulin increases estradiol binding to these receptors  45  in turn estrogen treatment decreases lipoprotein lipase and cell size while increasing insulin receptor binding  46  it has also been suggested that the effects of androgens and estrogens on adipogenesis may be related to the igf1 receptor and pparγ  43  further supporting the idea that fatty acid composition can regulate a complex interrelationship involved in the regulation of adipocyte development the increased level of differentiated adipocytes in clafed females suggests that cla may increase the number of estrogenresponsive cells which could alter metabolism in these cells the inherently low levels of estrogen present in prepuberty may limit this response the evidence of cellular changes without changes in tissue mass may therefore be due to timing in that the interaction between cla and steroid hormones is not maximal at this age in vivo and in vitro studies show that the igf system is a critical regulator of adipogenesis and the lack of igf1 or igfbinding protein igfbp 1 significantly inhibits adipogenesis  47 48  it has been concluded that igf may act through differential glucose uptake by adipose tissue and muscle cells in female spraguedawley rats  49  a previous study by li et al  50 showed that cla increases igfbp3 and serum igf1 levels suggesting that cla may be modulating body mass through mechanisms involving the igf system although our results showed that serum igf1 was not altered in weanling rats it is possible that other elements of the igf system including igfii and the igfbp may be influenced if the mode of action of cla is through mediating growth the response in females may have been masked by the timing of killing the rats 11 wk of age in this study it may be necessary to study males and females at various ages when similar stages of growth have been reached studies of clasupplemented adult humans have produced conflicting results zambell et al  51 did not find significant changes in body composition or energy expenditure in healthy women consuming 3 g clad whereas blankson et al  52 observed reductions in weight of overweight men and women given 34 or 68 g clad these results suggest that changes in adiposity with cla may occur only during certain stages of growth further demonstrating the need for studies during different stages of growth it is also important to note that conflicting results concerning the extent of body composition changes may also be due to species differences there are a number of studies in mice that have shown great reductions in body fat mass and improved feed efficiency and growth  18 53 – 56 however studies in rats have repeatedly failed to show similar extents of change in variables including food intake feed efficiency growth and weight gain  15 16 19 57 – 60  collectively these results suggest that cla consumption during gestation and lactation may imprint development and result in changes in adulthood similar to the results seen in other fetal programming studies contrary to results in in vitro studies suggesting effects of cla on adipocyte proliferation  23 24  there was no evidence of an in vivo effect of cla on fat cell number in rats it seems that the effects of cla on adipose tissue development muscle development growth and body composition are influenced by the animals sex and that this influence may play a key role in development before the onset of puberty these effects may be a result of direct or indirect action by androgens andor estrogens or a result of growth during different phases the growth of female spraguedawley rats reaches a plateau several weeks earlier than that of males which may be a confounding factor if the actions of cla are dependent on growth of the animal the present results justify future studies to determine the effects of cla at various stages of growth and development and the differential effects
