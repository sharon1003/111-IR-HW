the third week of life gastrulation and the formation of the trilaminar embryoprofessor alfred cuschieri department of anatomy university of malta in most animals the blastula develops into a gastrula that consists of a distended saclike structure with an opening at one end important changes occur at the opening of the gastrula involving migration of cells and leading to the formation of a trilaminar embryo in humans the embryo does not form a gastrula but the changes leading to the formation of the trilaminar embryo occur and are known as gastrulation by the 13 thday the embryo has the form of a bilaminar disc with a distinct polarity the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac can be visualised as two hemispheres with their apposed surfaces forming the bilaminar embryo the main changes associated with gastrulation affect the epiblast when viewed from above ie through the amniotic cavity the epiblast appears as an oval disc the connecting stalk marks the caudal end of the embryo the primitive streak appears in the caudal half of the epiblast and lies along the craniocaudal axis it consists of · the primitive node and pit· the primitive streak and groove the buccopharyngeal membrane and the cloacal membrane are two areas that mark the future mouth and anus respectively they are situated in the midline at the cranial and caudal ends respectively three important processes occur at the primitive streak1 cell proliferation  causes heaping up of the cells and is the source of a new layer of cells2 cell migration by amoeboid movement – the cells insinuate themselves between the epiblast and hypoblast3 cell determination  the cells arising from the primitive streak are determined to give rise to different rudiments the notochord the notochordal process grows out from the primitive node grows as a rod of cells that migrate cranially in the midline its growth is limited by the buccopharyngeal membrane the most cranial part of the notochord is termed the prochordal plate the notochordal process becomes canalised forming a hollow tube communicating with the primitive pit the floor of the tube and the underlying endoderm break down and a temporary communication is established between the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac this communication is termed the neurenteric canal it is very shortlasting as the notochord proliferates to form a solid cord intraembryonic mesoderm while the cells from the primitive node proliferate and migrate to form a midline notochord cells from the primitve streak migrate laterally and cranially between the epiblast and hypoblast to form the intraembryonic mesoderm the meosderm lies on either side of the notochord the buccopharyngeal membrane and the cloacal membrane the epiblast and hypoblast remain in contact at the buccopharyngeal and cloacal membranes which are not separated by mesoderm growth of the bilaminar disc as the intraembryonic mesoderm spreads out from the primitive streak the whole embryo increases in size and the primitive streak becomes relatively smaller when the process of gastrulation is complete the primitive streak disappears changes consequent on gastrulation with the process of gastrulation the following changes have occurred1 the embryo becomes a trilaminar embryo that is still in the form of a flat disc2 epiblast and hypoblast are now known as ectoderm and endoderm respectively3 mesoderm does not extend between epiblast and hypoblast at the buccopharyngeal and cloacal membranes4 intraembryonic mesoderm merges with the extraembryonic mesoderm at the periphery of the embryonic disc5 gastrulation converts the embryo into a trilaminar disc6 gastrulaton can be inhibited by drugs that interfere with actin filament formation – they inhibit cytokinesis and cell migration7 the migrating cells can be traced experimentally in chick embryos by transplanting embryonic cells of the primitive streak from quail embryos quail cells have nuclei that are morphologically different fromthose of chick cells and can be distinguished microscopically mesoderm forms several distinct masses i mesoderm in the lateral part of the embryo is divided into three distinct longitudinal masses a paraxial mesoderm a longitudinal column of cells that lies next to the notochord it gives rise to the axial skeleton and skeletal muscle it becomes segmented b intermediate cell mass it gives rise to the genitourinary system c lateral plate mesoderm gives rise to body wall structures is continuous with the extraembryonic mesoderm splits into two layers enclosing the intraembryonic coelom ii the septum transversum forms a transverse bar of mesoderm cranial to the buccopharyngeal membrane– is the only place where mesoderm extends across the midline– is the region where the future heart diaphphragm and liver will develop iii the caudal mesoderm lies caudaly lateral to the primitive streak– is the region that gives rise to the caudal structures including the pelvic viscera the paraxial mesoderm is segmented of the three blocks pf mesoderm only the paraxial mesoderm is segmented the segments are termed somites the first somite appears on day 20 at the cranial end close to the prochordal plate somites develop in craniocaudal sequence to form 42 to 44 somites by day 30 the somites are4 occipital 8 cervical 12 thoracic 5 lumbar 5 sacral and 3 coccygeal a few other somites at the caudal end degenerate a coelom develops in the lateral plate mesoderm the intraembryonic coelom develops in the lateral plate mesoderm and extends into the transverse mesoderm it develops by the breaking down of cells by apoptosis programmed cell death the intraembryonic coelom is shaped like an inverted utube and is divided into three parts a the bend is situated in the transverse mesoderm and is dilated to form the pericardial cavity b the stems of the utube extend into the lateral plate mesoderm were it forms the paired pleuroperitoneal canals c the distal caudal end of the intraembryonic coelom communicates laterally with the extraembryonic coelom the concept of induction the embryological processes of development follow a definite coordinated sequence induction is the stimulation of a group of cells to undergo differentiation by another closelysituated group of cell an example of induction is the initial development of the central nervous system here the notochord a midline rod of cells stimulates the overlying ectoderm to differentiate into neurectoderm the neural plate the neurectoderm is now termed the neural plate like the notochord it is limited craniallly by the buccopharyngeal membrane and caudally by the cloacal membrane the cranial end of the neural plate· is broader than the more caudal part· overlies the prochordal plate· gives rise to the brain the main part · overlies the notochord· gives rise to the spinal cord the caudal end of the embryo continues to elongate by growth from the primitive streak genetic organization of the primitive streak the diagram below shows that primitive node and streak release a number of genetically controlled factors these are shown on the right of the diagram together with their main function in patterning of the embryo it is not important to memorise the strange names given to these factors note how these factors play a critical role in determining the craniocaudal axis of the embryo the primitive node is the first and central structure it determines the growth of the notochord cranially by factor nhf3 b and of the primitive streak caudally by the factor nodal and the body axis by the factor goosecoid  it is also responsible for inducing the cells to become motile and migrate to predetermined sites by the factor tgene  note also how the prochordal plate determines the cranial end of the embryo by factor lim1  establishment of rightleft asymmetry this is the second critical event in patterning of the embryo and in determining the asymmetric development of the viscera on the right and left sides of the body this right left differentiation is determined by several laterality genes the main ones of which are show below the signalling molecule known as sonic hedgehog shh is expressed bilaterally and symmetrically activin is expressed only on the left inhibits the further action of shh and causes a differential expression of the growth factor nodal there are also genes that specifically determine development of structures only on the left side these have been called inversus viscerum and leftright dynein mutations of these genes cause “situs inversus” where the apex of the heart the spleen and the stomach are situated on the right instead of of the left there are three big classes of factors that are involved in the genetic control of early embryonic development1 transcription factors these are factors that · act within the cells that produce them· bind to dna and controls transcription of other genes· initiate patterns of gene expression there are various families of transcription factors homeodomain  hox gene family zinc finger – a family of steroidbinding transcrition factors basic helixloophelix protein – myogenic regulatory factors winged helix – hepatocyte nuclear factor32 signalling molecules these are molecules that· exert their effect on other cells· mediate most interactions eg induction· bind to transmembrane receptor molecules· are mainly growth factors examples are transforming growth factorb tgfb – activate posterior hox genes fibroblast growth factor fgf – activate anrterior hox genes nerve growth factor ngf – stimulate growth of axons hedgehog proteins – mediate early inductive interactions3 cell adhesion molecules· they are responsible for specific cell aggregation and sorting· some are calciumdependent cadherins· some are calciumindependent caman example is the differentiation of the epiblast into neurectoderm induced by the notochord and skin ectoderm by the differential expression of ncam and lcam in the neurectoderm and skin ectoderm respectively
