summary of the data findings2012 saw near record imports of nitrogen moderate declines in phosphate exports and large declines in potash imports u s nitrogen and potash supplies largely depend on imports more than 50 percent of nitrogen n and 85 percent of potash k 2 o supply was from imports in fertilizer year july 1 to june 30 2011 see the topic page fertilizer use and markets for market shares of u s domestically produced fertilizers because domestic production capacity is limited any increase in nitrogen and potash supply will be largely from imports in contrast u s phosphate p 2 o 5 supply mainly depends on domestic production which provided about 56 percent of domestic use in year 2012 the u s is the world’s largest importer of nitrogen fertilizers and the largest exporter of phosphate fertilizers in calendar year 2012 the u s imported 1074 million tons of nitrogen 049 million tons of phosphate and 578 million tons of potash imports of nitrogen were largely unchanged from 2011 levels while imports of phosphate and potash declined 22 and 20 percent respectively meanwhile in 2012 the u s exported 175 384 and 019 million tons of nitrogen phosphate and potash respectively exports of nitrogen and potash increased 4 and 48 percent respectively over 2011 levels while exports of phosphate declined 10 percent as a result during 2012 net nitrogen and potash imports decreased 1 percent and 21 percent respectively while net phosphate exports decreased 8 percent from 2011 levels plant nutrients imported from july to december of 2012 are expected to be used for 2013 crops from july to december of 2012 imports of nitrogen totaled 547 million tons up 7 percent from julydecember 2011 totals meanwhile u s nitrogen exports were down 13 percent to 073 million tons compared with the same time period in 2011 as a result net nitrogen imports in julydecember 2012 were up 3 percent over net imports during the same period in 2011 from july to december of 2012 exports of u s phosphate totaled 155 million tons down 25 percent from the same time period in 2011 meanwhile u s phosphate imports were 027 million tons which is 88 percent more than julydecember 2011 imports as a result net phosphate exports in julydecember 2012 decreased 33 percent from net exports during the same period in 2011 from july to december of 2012 u s potash imports totaled 291 million tons up 1 percent from julydecember 2011 u s potash export increased to 0101 million tons up 85 percent as a result net potash imports in julydecember 2012 were down less than 1 percent from net imports during the same period in 2011 near record imports of nitrogen reflected strong u s demand in 2012 largely driven by high grain prices the 2012 drought seems to have had little significant effect on nitrogen demand because of increasing natural gas supplies in the u s nitrogen can now be produced more cheaply domestically than it can be imported at the global price several new u s ammonia plants are currently under construction that could add 25 percent more to current domestic production capacity by 2016 but in the meantime increased demand must be met through increased imports raising the average price of nitrogen the decline in phosphate exports in 2012 reflected weakening global demand due to increased foreign supplies in global phosphate markets exports to india and brazil the two largest importers of u s phosphate were reduced nearly 50 percent and 30 percent respectively in 2012 meanwhile the average phosphate dap price in the u s was slightly lower in 2012 than the high price in 2011 relatively high prices and the 2012 drought apparently softened u s phosphate demand in addition the 2012 drought left a considerable amount of applied phosphate in the soil thus some farmers might reduce phosphate use in the fall for 2013 crops the decline in potash imports mainly from canada which provided 85 percent of u s potash supply in the 2012 was due to weakening u s demand caused largely by relatively high prices and the drought similar to phosphate the 2012 drought left a considerable amount of applied potash in the soil so some farmers might reduce potash use in the fall for 2013 crops the average u s price of potash was slightly lower in 2012 than the high price in 2011 u s imports of selected fertilizers by nutrient content july–december 2012nitrogen
