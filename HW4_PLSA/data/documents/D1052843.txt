facebook twitter share punishment for impeachment judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor trust or profit under the united states but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment trial judgment and punishment according to law article i section 3 clause 7teachers companion lesson pdfthe punishment for impeachment clause sets forth the scope and nature of the punishments that the senate may impose in impeachment trials in fashioning this clause the delegates to the constitutional convention deliberately distinguished impeachment in this country from the british system by limiting the punishments in the federal constitution to those typically found in state constitutions that is removal and disqualification in contrast to the house of lords practice of imposing any punishment including death in an impeachment proceeding since ratification four troublesome questions have arisen under this clause the first was whether the senate may impose the sanctions of removal and disqualification separately and if so how the senate claims that it may impose these sanctions by separate votes 1 removal involving the ouster of an official from the office he occupies at the time of his impeachment trial and 2 disqualification barring the person from ever serving again in the federal government in 1862 and 1913 the senate took separate votes to remove and disqualify judges west humphreys and robert archbald respectively for each judge a supermajority first voted to convict followed by a simple majority vote to disqualify the senate defended this practice on the ground that the clause mentioning disqualification does not specify the requisite vote for its imposition although article ii section 4 mentions removal as following conviction the senate in 1862 and 1913 considered that the supermajority requirement was designed as a safeguard against removal that once satisfied did not extend to the separate imposition of disqualification the second question involves the proper sequence of impeachment and criminal proceedings it is clear from practice and judicial interpretation that officials other than the president may be convicted and even imprisoned before impeachment the question is whether a sitting president though not singled out in the text of the constitution is immune from trial and conviction in the ordinary courts before impeachment and removal from office the provision that a convicted official is liable and subject to indictment trial judgement and punishment according to law gives rise to two constructions alexander hamilton in the federalist no 69 construed the clause as requiring that a president would first be impeached and removed from office and would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the course of law the argument made by many of president william jefferson clintons defenders during his impeachment and trial is that prosecuting presidents poses a unique risk not applicable to prosecuting the leaders of other branches because the executive branch is the only federal branch overseen by a single individual and thus prosecuting its leader—the president—uniquely risks paralyzing the entire branch he oversees the counterarguments seem at least as strong first the clause could be read not as requiring that impeachment precede prosecution but as reflecting an expectation that impeachments generally might but are not required to precede prosecutions in other words the constitution merely provides that these proceedings are mutually exclusive second the president is not above the law and a president is subject to the same legal requirements and burdens as any citizen as implied by two unanimous supreme court decisions united states v nixon 1974 the president is not immune to subpoenas for evidence in a federal criminal trial and clinton v jones 1997 the president is not immune from civil litigation based on his personal unofficial conduct third several judges have been prosecuted and even imprisoned before being impeached indeed several courts rejected their efforts to bar their prosecutions before being impeached on the other hand an impeachable offense such as abuse of office may not be a crime if an impeachable offense had to be first enacted into a criminal code then the house of representatives would not have the sole power to impeach because a criminal law would first have to be passed and therefore approved by the other branches of government the third question involves the interpretation of the provision that judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor trust or profit under the united states throughout president clintons impeachment proceedings members of congress considered whether this language permitted the congress to impose a sanction against him short of impeachment and removal such as a resolution passed by the house or senate denouncing him for his misconduct the congressional and academic debates at the time remain the most extensive yet on the legitimacy of censure there are strong arguments against censure first the constitution does not explicitly authorize censure second the vesting of the impeachment power in congress arguably implies the exclusion of other means by which to punish officials who have committed impeachable offenses third the use of censure would undermine the framers objective to narrow the range of permissible sanctions in an impeachment trial fourth allowing censure could upset the delicate system of checks and balances by making it easier for congress to harass or embarrass a president fifth censure conceivably constitutes a bill of attainder a legislative imposition of a punishment that only a court should have been authorized to impose after a trial there are also arguments supporting censure first the relevant text seems to imply that lesser punishments than removal or disqualification are permissible second other clauses of the constitution including the speech and debate clause the first amendments freedom of speech guarantee and the vesting of power in the house and the senate to keep journals of their respective proceedings empower members of congress to enter critical comments about public figures into the congressional record while a censure consisting of mere words may or may not be thought a meaningful punishment such expression could be easily accomplished outside of the impeachment process as a matter of collective speech of senators and representatives third historical practices support censure the house and senate have passed over a dozen such resolutions including resolutions condemning presidents james k polk and andrew jackson hence the debates over censure like those over the other questions about the appropriate sanctions the senate may impose for presidential misconduct are likely to persist until historical practice resolves the matter michael j gerhardt samuel ashe distinguished professor in constitutional
