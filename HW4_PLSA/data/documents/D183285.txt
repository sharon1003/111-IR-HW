from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search primary sclerosing cholangitis cholangiogram of primary sclerosing cholangitis specialty gastroenterology primary sclerosing cholangitis  psc is a longterm progressive disease of the liver and gallbladder characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts which normally allow bile to drain from the gallbladder affected individuals may have no symptoms or may experience signs and symptoms of liver disease such as yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes itching and abdominal pain the bile duct scarring which occurs in psc narrows the ducts of the biliary tree and impedes the flow of bile to the intestines eventually this can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver failure psc increases the risk of various cancers including liver cancer gallbladder carcinoma colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma 1 2 the underlying cause of psc is unknown genetic susceptibility immune system dysfunction and abnormal composition of the gut flora may play a role 3 4 this is further suggested by the observation that approximately 75 of individuals with psc also have inflammatory bowel disease ibd most often ulcerative colitis 5there is no effective medical treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis the most definitive treatment for psc is a liver transplant but it can recur after transplantation 1 few people affected by psc require a liver transplant psc is a rare disease and most commonly affects people with ibd 2 approximately 3â€“75 of people with ulcerative colitis have psc and 80 of people with psc have some form of ibd 3 diagnosis usually occurs in younger people in their 30s or 40s 3 individuals of northern european ancestry are affected more often than people of southern european or asian descent 2 men are affected more often than women 6 the disease was initially described in the mid1800s but was not fully characterized until the 1970s with the advent of improved medical imaging techniques such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp 6contents  hide 1 signs and symptoms2 cause3 pathophysiology4 diagnosis41 classification5 management6 prognosis61 related diseases7 epidemiology8 research directions9 see also10 references11 external links signs and symptoms  editnearly half of people with psc do not have symptoms and are often incidentally discovered to have psc due to abnormal liver function tests 1 but a substantial proportion will have debilitating signs and symptoms of the disease 7 signs and symptoms of psc may include severe itching and nonspecific fatigue yellowing of the skin and white portion of the eyes may also be seen enlargement of the liver and spleen are seen in approximately 40 of affected individuals abdominal pain affects about 20 of people with psc multiple episodes of lifethreatening acute cholangitis infection within the bile ducts can be seen due to impaired drainage of the bile ducts which increases the risk of infection 8dark urine due to excess conjugated bilirubin which is watersoluble and excreted by the kidneys ie choluriamalabsorption especially of fat and steatorrhea fatty stool due to an inadequate amount of bile reaching the small intestine leading to decreased levels of the fatsoluble vitamins a d e and k portal hypertension a complication of cirrhosis which can manifest with esophageal and parastomal varices 9 as well as hepatic encephalopathy mental status alterationdisturbance caused by liver dysfunction and shunting of blood away from the scarred liver such that ammonia detoxification is reduced with concomitant encephalopathy cause  editthe exact cause of primary sclerosing cholangitis is unknown and its pathogenesis is poorly understood 1 although psc is thought to be an autoimmune disease it does not demonstrate a clear response to immunosuppressants thus many experts believe it to be a complex multifactorial including immunemediated disorder and perhaps one that encompasses several different hepatobiliary diseases 10 11data have provided novel insights suggestingan important association between the intestinal microbiota and psc 12 13 14 anda process referred to as cellular senescence and the senescenceassociated secretory phenotype sasp in the pathogenesis of psc 15 16in addition there are longstanding wellrecognized associations between psc and human leukocyte antigen hla alleles a1 b8 and dr3 4pathophysiology  editpsc is characterized by inflammation of the bile ducts cholangitis with consequent stricturing ie narrowing and hardening  sclerosis of these ducts due to scar formation be it inside andor outside the liver 17 the resulting scarring of the bile ducts obstructs the flow of bile which further perpetuates bile duct and liver injury chronic impairment of bile flow due to blockage and dysfunctional bile transport  cholestasis causes progressive biliary fibrosis and ultimately biliary cirrhosis and liver failure 18the primary physiological function of bile is to assist in the breakdown and absorption of fat in the intestinal tract a relative deficiency of bile can lead to fat malabsorption and deficiencies of fatsoluble vitamins a d e k  citation neededliver enlargement is seen due to portal hypertension caused by compression of portal veins by the proximate sclerosed intrahepatic bile ducts and leads to right upper quadrant abdominal pain diagnosis  editct scan findings in a case of primary sclerosing cholangitis psc is generally diagnosed on the basis of having at least two of three clinical criteria after secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis have been ruled outserum alkaline phosphatase alp  15x the upper limit of normal for longer than 6 monthscholangiography demonstrating biliary strictures or irregularity consistent with psc andliver biopsy consistent with psc if available historically a cholangiogram would be obtained via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp which typically reveals beading alternating strictures and dilation of the bile ducts inside andor outside the liver currently the preferred option for diagnostic cholangiography given its noninvasive yet highly accurate nature is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography mrcp a magnetic resonance imaging technique mrcp has unique strengths including high spatial resolution and can even be used to visualize the biliary tract of small animal models of psc 19most people with psc have evidence of autoantibodies and abnormal immunoglobulin levels 20 for example approximately 80 of people with psc have perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies however this and other immunoglobulin findings are not specific to those with psc and are of unclear clinical significanceconsequence antinuclear antibodies and antismooth muscle antibody are found in 2050 of psc patients and likewise are not specific for the disease but may identify a subgroup of psc patients who also have autoimmune hepatitis ie pscaih overlap syndrome 4other markers which may be measured and monitored are a complete blood count serum liver enzymes bilirubin levels usually grossly elevated kidney function and electrolytes fecal fat measurement is occasionally ordered when symptoms of malabsorption eg gross steatorrhea are prominent the differential diagnosis can include primary biliary cholangitis formerly referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis  druginduced cholestasis cholangiocarcinoma ig g4related disease postliver transplantation nonanastomotic biliary strictures 21 and hiv associated cholangiopathy 22 primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cholangitis are distinct entities and exhibit important differences including the site of tissue damage within the liver associations with inflammatory bowel disease ibd which includes ulcerative colitis and crohns disease response to treatment and risks of disease progression 23classification  editprimary sclerosing cholangitis is typically classified into three subgroups based on whether the small andor large bile ducts are affected the subgroups of psc include the following 1classic pscsmallduct pscpsc associated with autoimmune hepatitis management  editno pharmacologic treatment has been approved by the u s food and drug administration for psc some experts recommend a trial of ursodeoxycholic acid udca a bile acid occurring naturally in small quantities in humans as it has been shown to lower elevated liver enzyme numbers in patients with psc and has proven effective in other cholestatic liver diseases however udca has yet to be shown to clearly lead to improved liver histology and survival 7 24 guidelines from the american association for the study of liver diseases and the american college of gastroenterology do not support the use of udca but guidelines from the european association for the study of the liver do endorse the use of moderate doses 1315 milligrams per kilogram of udca for psc 1 25 26 27supportive treatment for psc symptoms is the cornerstone of management these therapies are aimed at relieving symptoms such as itching with antipruritics eg bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine  antibiotics to treat episodes of ascending cholangitis and vitamin supplements as people with psc are often deficient in fatsoluble vitamins  vitamin a vitamin d vitamin e and vitamin k  28ercp and specialized techniques may also be needed to help distinguish between a benign psc stricture and a bile duct cancer  cholangiocarcinoma  29liver transplantation is the only proven longterm treatment of psc although only a fraction of individuals with psc will need it indications for transplantation include recurrent bacterial ascending cholangitis decompensated cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma hilar cholangiocarcinoma and complications of portal hypertension not all patients are candidates for liver transplantation and some will experience disease recurrence afterward 10prognosis  editestimated median survival from diagnosis until liver transplant or pscrelated death is 213 years 30 various models have been developed to help predict survival but their use is generally best suited for research and not clinical purposes a serum alkaline phosphatase less than 15 times the upper limit of normal has been associated with better outcomes but its utility in predicting longterm outcomes is unclear 1related diseases  editthe development of any of the cancers associated with psc predicts a poor prognosis complications from pscassociated cancers account for 40 of deaths from psc 2 primary sclerosing cholangitis is one of the major known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma 31 a cancer of the biliary tree for which the lifetime risk among patients with psc is 1015 3 this represents a 400fold greater risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma compared to the general population 1 surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma in patients with psc is encouraged with some experts recommending annual surveillance with a specialized imaging study and serum markers 32 although consensus regarding the modality and interval has yet to be established  citation needed similarly a screening colonoscopy is recommended in people who receive a new diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis since their risk of colorectal cancer is 10 times higher than that of the general population 1psc is strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease ibd in particular ulcerative colitis uc and to a lesser extent crohns disease as many as 5 of patients with ibd are codiagnosed with psc 33 and approximately 70 of people with psc have ibd 18 of note the presence of colitis appears to be associated with a greater risk of liver disease progression and bile duct cancer cholangiocarcinoma development although this relationship remains poorly understood 34 close monitoring of psc patients is vital various forms of gallbladder disease such as gallstones and gallbladder polyps are also common in those with psc 1 approximately 25 of people with psc have gallstones 1 ultrasound surveillance of the gallbladder every year is recommended for people with psc 1 any person with psc who is found to have a mass in the gallbladder should undergo surgical removal of the gallbladder due to the high risk of cholangiocarcinoma 1 osteoporosis hepatic osteodystrophy and hypothyroidism are also associated with psc epidemiology  editthere is a 231 maletofemale predilection in primary sclerosing cholangitis 18 psc can affect men and women at any age although it is commonly diagnosed in the fourth decade of life most often in the presence of inflammatory bowel disease ibd 17 psc progresses slowly and is often asymptomatic so it can be present for years before it is diagnosed and before it causes clinically significant consequences there is relatively little data on the prevalence and incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis with studies in different countries showing annual incidence of 0068â€“13 per 100000 people and prevalence 022â€“85 per 100000 given that psc is closely linked with ulcerative colitis it is likely that the risk is higher in populations where uc is more common 35 in the united states an estimated 29000 individuals have psc 1research directions  editalthough there is no curative treatment several clinical trials are underway that aim to slow progression of this liver disease 36 obeticholic acid is being investigated as a possible treatment for psc due to its antifibrotic effects simtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the profibrotic enzyme loxl2 that is being developed as a possible therapy for psc 1see also  editchris klug â€“ professional snowboarder with psc who had liver transplant chris le
