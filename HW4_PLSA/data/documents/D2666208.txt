laboratory apparatus and equipment identification and uses introduction if you look at a mechanic’s tool chest you will find a variety of tools a skilled mechanic will use the correct tool for each different job that he must perform chemistry uses the same idea each fundamental laboratory technique requires a different “tool” or piece of lab equipment to complete the process lab safety requires that the correct equipment or “tool” be used for each different technique in the first few experiments you will become familiar with different pieces of lab equipment and their uses in turn this familiarity will enable you to complete other experiments efficiently and well what’s in the picture examine the photo identify and list as many pieces of lab equipment as you can find laboratory apparatus  equipment with their functions use the table on the next page along with the drawings as a reference source for your laboratory work if you have any questions about which piece of equipment to use or how to use the equipment start here then if you still have questions ask your instructor read the information in the list compare the descriptionfunction of each piece of equipment with the diagram as you go through the list ask yourself if “the form follows the function” will it do what it is supposed to do based on its design xvii laboratory apparatus  equipment with their functions name apron 38 beaker 6 beaker tongs 1 identified by the curved rubbercovered arms bunsen burner 26 burette 34 clamp 22 clay triangle 20 cobalt glass 2 crucible tongs 21 cruciblelid 5 deflagration spoon 25 dropper 8 or transfer pipet 8a erlenmeyer flask 10 evaporating dish 29 florence flask 28 forceps 3 funnel 23 goggles 33 graduated cylinder 27 iron ring 12 mortar and pestle 30 pipette 36 pipette filler 37 reagent bottle 19 ring stand 7 rubber stopper 11 stainless steel scoop 32 stirring rod 15 striker or matches 31 test tube 16 test tube brush 18 test tube holder 17 test tube rack 4 thistle tube 24 tongs 9 wash bottle 35 watch glass 14 wire gauze pad 13 wooden splint 39 function or use protect clothing from chemical spills lab safety holding and heating liquids can also hold solids if the temperature of the beaker is higher than boiling water do not use beaker tongs see 1 used for picking up hot beakers containing only boiling water do not pick up anything hotter than a beaker with boiling water the rubber on the beaker tongs can burn at higher temperatures don’t do it for heating open flame requires safety measures especially goggles and long hair tied back measure liquid volume during an acidbase titration support needs to be attached to a ring stand support crucibles or evaporating dishes for high temperature heating dark blue glass used in flame tests used to pick up hot crucibles and evaporating dishes high temperature heating of materials lid may be used to prevent splattering use crucible tongs only 21 special spoon for deflagration reactions not used in our labs deliver drops of liquid used in small scale chemistry labs holding and heating liquids evaporation of small amounts of liquid it should be covered with a watch glass to prevent splattering use crucible tongs only 21 holding and heating liquids tweezers manipulate small objects used for filtration transfer liquids without spilling eye protection—required when chemicals are used measure liquid volume use an appropriate size that is only a little larger than volume to be measured support a clay triangle or wire gauze also used to support a funnel while filtering needs a ring stand grinding up dry chemicals or other materials accurately measure and deliver small volumes of liquid fill a pipette safely—can be plastic 37a or rubber 37b contain liquid or solid chemicals support used with iron ring or clamp close a test tube flask or reagent bottle don’t heat a “stoppered” closed container scoop out chemicals also for stirring chunky mixtures eg ice water glass used for stirring liquids care required when used in a test tube lighting the bunsen burner by producing a spark hold and perhaps heat various liquids use caution don’t point test tube at anyone while heating cleanwashscrub out test tubes hold test tubes while heating use requires care hold up test tubes made of metal plastic or wood specialized funnel used for unique cases not used in our labs not used use special purpose tongs only—see 1 and 21 rinse out beakers during filtration rinse other things transfer dry chemicals also a cover for an evaporating dish support evaporating dish or crucible while heating can be used as a “hot pad” for a hot crucible or evaporating dish when placed on lab bench no illustration used for flame tests burns longer than a match xviii laboratory apparatus and equipment 8a 34 33 35 36 37a xix 37b 38 39 — blank page xx
