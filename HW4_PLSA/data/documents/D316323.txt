cars  transportation safety thieves have stolen my car keys what should i do i had a break in at my home the other night and the thieves stole a set of my car keys they broke in and were disturbed by my dad they actually attempted to steal the car but crashed it into a tree in my driveway and abandoned it the police have the car to look for fingerprints etc and we think we know show more follow 9 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer ok depending on what evidence the police find in your car they probably will charge the person for burglary as they did break into your house although failed at taking your car the phone you found will probably help too and if they are caught with your keys then they should be charged as for your car there isnt much you can do to be honest i dont think its possible to change the locks but if it is i would imagine its highly expensive the most i think you could do is get a steering wheel clamp or wheel clamps even remove the fuses so while they might still have your keys you can at least make it harder for them to steel swღ · 8 years ago0 3 comment askers rating you should report this to your insurance company and take the hit on your no claims bonus the reason for this is very simple your car will never be safe they know where you live and can follow you to work or shopping and they can take your car at any time they want even if you recover your stolen car keys the thieves may have taken copies of them if you car is stolen or opened and goods taken then the insurance company may refuse to pay out they will argue that you ignored the keys theft and so you did not take due care to protect the vehicle there will be a clause in the policy saying something like that this will cost you more than a single set back in your noclaims you must have the ignition lock and the door locks only the ones with keyholes replaced and have a new set of keys the master key used to program replacement keys will cost £80£120 depending on the make and the locks about £30 each despite what someone has written it is not a job that you can easily do yourself to keep your insurance company happy the locks would have to be replaced by one of their approved workshops its a very expensive business so compare the cost of paying yourself with the loss of 1 year noclaims but it is much better than risking your car and the insurance not paying if its stolen or damaged as this was a household burglary and the keys were in the house you could try claiming from your household policy for replacement keys and locks in other words  sorry but you must report it and theyll pay for new locks and keys if you dont and the car is stolen then you will probably not get paid anything for it until you can get the car to the garage you should take other antitheft precautions such as fitting a crooklok from halfords or removing the battery overnight there is no easy way to protect yourself without risking everything and they will be back be sure of that police statistics show that about 80 of burglars return within 3 months  to finish the job and to steal things that you have replaced under insurance the tank · 8 years ago0 0 comment stolen car keys source shttpsshorteima9xowrhine · 1 year ago0 0 comment a tow truck can drag it off anytime but as far as the scope of your question yes if a thief has to wiring diagram he can usually figure out how to get around the security on most cars for example there is one particular german luxury brand that uses a chipped security key for antitheft it really just grounds out a wire going to a relay that controls the fuel and spark using a wiring diagram you can see how to bypass the relay and the engine will crank up when the ignition switch is turned  whether it is with another key or busted with a screw driver kathryn · 2 years ago0 0 comment buy one of the better streering wheel locks £75 from halfords no one can remove these easily without a key the brand name is disclock john s · 8 years ago0 0 comment take you spare set and use it to remove the old ignition swich and put in a new oneas for the door lockswell that would cost a lot to change out because of the labor involved in removing the door panels and such so what i would do is get an alarm systemthat way if the come back and open the door they are gonna get one hell of a surprise biobug · 8 years ago0 1 comment for the meantime why dont you just have your local auto repair shop install an ignition kill switch that can be hidden so that you will only know where its at and that will give you some piece of mind ucantcme · 8 years ago1 0 comment take it to the dealer and have to keys changed tsw · 8 years ago0 0 comment iwould doubt they will come back again but you never know so may be you could change the locks · 8 years ago0 1 comment perhaps you would like to learn more about one of these find the perfect midsize suv looking for a new crossover these are the best luxury cars looking for vehicle trackers
