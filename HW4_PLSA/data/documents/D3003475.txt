 january 27 2008 258 am pstin reply to my directv receiver model is r15 dvr plus i just read this thread today and i realize it is old but i would like to give my input i have the direct tv hd tivo dvr hr10250 panasonic 32 lcd hd tv and the panasonic dmrez475v dvdvcr recorder you can read the review on cnet on the panasonic dvd recorder i purchased the panasonic dvr recorder to burn dvds of programs sd  hd that i have saved on my tivo hd dvr the panasonic dvr does a good job and the picture quality is good a few tips i have to first switch the direct tv tivo hd dvr to 480i in order for the panasonic dvr to recognize and record the tivo dvr program material and also live feed tv programs this might not be necessary with other type dvr recorders it will not work if you select save to vcr from the tivo menu skip this step which is recommended in the tivo instruction manual at least with my panasonic dvr it doesnt work live tv programming along with any program stored on the tivo dvr hd receiver can be recorded to a dvd one hour record mode and two hour will give you the best quality the hd programs look the best and are very close to true hd i was very surprised to discover this maybe my equipment has something to do with this anyone looking for a dvr recorder should read the cnet reviews on dvr recorders my panasonic dvrvcr recorder will copy vhs tapes to dvd is one simple step panasonic offers good customer support i know im plugging panasonic with my comments but im just giving my feedback on my personal experience with this type of recording hope this helps

from direct tv dvr model hr 20 700wfly fish its a very simple process to record your directv dvr content onto dvds 1 connect your dvr to your dvd recorder using an rca composite av cable marked with colors of red white and yellow 3 cables attached to each other output from dvr to input of dvd recorder using any available input on dvd recorder usually marked input 1 input 2 and perhaps input 3 depending what kind of recorder you have 2 using dvd recorders remote control switch the input on your dvd recorder to the corresponding input which you have connected composite av cable to the input on the back of your dvd recorder this will sync dvr through your dvd recorders channel this method is similar to as if youd connect your vcr to the tv and setting vcrs channel to ch 3 in modern dvd technology the principle remains the same except ch 3 was replaced by input 1 input 2 input 3 av in etc while youre recording the dvr content you must stay on it until you finish recording otherwise if you change the channel on directv dvr then it will record whatever is on your tv im trying to say that this recording procedure is not the same as if you were recording a tv program onto your dvr and being able to watch something else while recoding a program from another channel im not trying to edify either but only to be as specific and instructive as possible so others can understand the principals of recording dvrs content onto dvd media please let me know if you succeed although the model of your dvr should have an antena out to tv that you can connect your dvr to dvd recorder using coaxial cable its the same kind of cable as it runs from your sat dish to the back of your dvr only in this case you would need to set the vcrdvd input to channel 3 to interact with dvr video quality

select the right input on your dvd recorder by using the channel button on your remote control to select the input that connects via dvr this is something similar to watching tv programs via vcr by

has minimum recording error rate nearly 98 defect free dvds are standard capacity of 47gb data size while actual data storage is 43gb an average movie size is 36 to 42 if you record from another dvd source but if youre recording from tv then data size will be much lesser because tv broadcasting is a condensed data dvd resolution supports 720x480 while full hd resolution is 1080i and 1080p if you record a hd movie with clearest picture possible on your satellite then your recoding quality would be between 720x480 and hd 1080i which would be hd 720i or 720p i  interlaced p  progressive these values are relating to the speed that matters to the video quality flag permalink this was helpful  0collapse  my new dvd recorder wont record shows from directv r15500by carlholmgren  march 23 2009
