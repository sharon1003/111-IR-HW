account fees are under fire from consumer groups which say the charges are excessive exorbitant unconscionable and unenforceable at law overdrawn account fees also called honour fees ranging from 20 to 38 are commonly charged by banks when accounts become overdrawn often by small amounts as a result of customers writing a cheque or authorising an electronic transfer of funds when they have insufficient money in the account david bell chief executive of the australian bankers association says banks have every right to charge these fees under their contract with the customer the fee is charged because the customer has agreed to pay the fee if a specified event has occurred bell says where the bank has made a judgement that the customer is a reasonable credit risk and allows them to overdraw their account it is quite reasonable to make a charge for that service however catherine wolthuizen finance policy officer with the australian consumers association says overdrawn account charges are not about cost recovery theyre about hitting people with a fee because they can and they generate substantial revenue for the banks advertisement advertisement the fees are particularly objectionable because they tend to disproportionately affect lowincome bank customers wolthuizen says these people dont have a buffer in their account and they can easily be pushed over the edge by a direct debit imposing a fee is not going to teach these people a lesson it just makes it harder for them to get back on their feet according to unfair fees a report into penalty fees charged by australian banks the initial charging of an overdrawn account fee starts a vicious cycle plunging a customers bank account even further into the red when they might otherwise have been able to clear the arrears the report issued in december last year by the consumer law centre victoria quoted several cases in which the imposition of an overdrawn account fee impacted harshly on a persons ability to manage their finances in one case a woman made a series of withdrawals over a month using eftpos which did not give her any information on the balance left in the account she inadvertently overdrew the account and made several withdrawals after that the total amount overdrawn was a few hundred dollars the report says however the woman was charged a 25 overdraft fee every time she overdrew the account this totalled 250 by the end of the month even though an amount equivalent to the amount overdrawn was deposited into the account during the month the account remained overdrawn due to the overdraw fees the report says that overdrawn account charges are among a range of penalty fees now imposed on customers which also include fees for late credit card payments fees for dishonoured cheques and fees for dishonoured direct debits nicole rich supervising solicitor with the consumer law centre victoria raised the question of whether such fees were unlawful given that penalty terms which seek not to compensate the innocent party but to penalise the other party for the breach or default are unenforceable at law but the banks enforce the fees by just siphoning the money out of the account even the belief that you have followed advice to maintain clear and available funds in our account to cover any outstanding cheques waiting to be presented wont necessarily save you in november last year this writer was charged a 30 overdrawn account fee after a cheque account became overdrawn by 517 adding insult to injury the overdraw was precipitated by the withdrawal by the bank three days earlier of 9 in transaction and accountkeeping fees and government debits tax in response to my fairly strident complaint the bank replied please be aware of the terms and conditions for your account that advise whenever your account has insufficient available funds to cover a withdrawal and becomes overdrawn by 1 or more a 30 overdrawn service fee will automatically apply however it did agree to refund the charge on this occasion because your account history clearly indicates that this is an irregular occurrence the bankers association rejects the notion that overdrawn account and other penalty fees could be unlawful this is a serious allegation bell says the consumer law centre of victorias report gives the strong impression that banks are seeking to impose fees which the law disallows but this cannot be substantiated from the information contained in the report and the association is fully confident that its member banks act within the law in their debtas a result of a few poorly timed transactions malcolm frawley 52 of sydney discovered his bank account was overdrawn by 4040 for about a day a letter from his bank st george followed saying it had debited 38 to his account in the form of a payment honour fee i just couldnt believe it frawley says ive been with that bank for 20 years  they could have called me and said hey youre in trouble here youd better put some money in your account thats what they did the last time my account became overdrawn which was about 10 years ago but to just ignore it and charge me 38 i might as well have gone out and bought myself a new tv presumably that would have earned me the same penalty denis orrock the general manager of info choice says the banks claim the overdrawn account fee is an administration charge but the amount frawley had been charged would represent a staggering 3433 per cent as an annualised interest rate orrock says that under the uniform consumer credit code fees charged by banks are meant to bear a direct relationship to their economic cost the question is has it cost the bank 38 to lend this man 4040 for 24 hours he says the aba says it urges customers experiencing difficulties to communicate with their bank if a customer is having difficulty making payments or experiencing temporary financial hardship then he or she should discuss this with the bank so the bank can take this into account says the abas chief executive david bell frawley wrote a letter of complaint to st george and received a reply which advised the fee is applied to your account via an automated process on the next working day after the account overdraws it said while it was the account holders responsibility to ensure there were sufficient funds available at all times it would refund the 38 on this occasion as a gesture of goodwill top of page
