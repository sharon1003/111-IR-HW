acidsbile ducts the canals or passageways that conduct bile there are three bile ducts the hepaticduct drains bile from the liver the cystic duct is an extension of the gallbladder and conveys bilefrom the gallbladder these two ducts may be thought of as branches that drain into the “trunk” or common bile duct the common bile duct passes through the wall of the small intestine at theduodenum and joins with the pancreatic duct to form the hepatopancreatic ampulla or ampulla of vater at the opening into the small intestine there is a sphincter that automatically controls theflow of bile into the intestine the bile ducts may become obstructed by gallstones benign or malignant tumors or a severelocal infection various disorders of the gallbladder or bile ducts are often diagnosed by ultrasonography radionuclide imaging and xray examination of the gallbladder and bile ductsusing a special contrast medium so that these hollow structures can be clearly outlined on the
