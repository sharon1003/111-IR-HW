by the world health organization who as a cellular imbalance between the supply of nutrients and energy and the bodys demand for them to ensure growth maintenance and specific functions 1 many diseases are directly or indirectly caused by a lack of essential nutrients in the diet test your familiarity with the nutritional deficiencies demonstrated in the following cases image from wikimedia commons  grook da oger note the changes in the papillary mucosa of this patient which take the form of scattered furrows and loss of filiform papillae 2the tongue and oral cavity are frequently the first regions of the body to show signs indicative of a vitamin deficiency tongue abnormalities may manifest as glossitis with atrophy of papillae as well as ulcers and fissures often accompanied by burning and tingling image from wikimedia commons  james heilman md skin pallor may also indicate a nutrient deficiency as in the pale hand of a woman with severe anemia left compared with the normal hand of her husband right iron deficiency can range from depleted iron stores without functional or health impairment to iron deficiency with anemia which affects the functioning of several organ systems iron deficiency is a concern because it can delay normal motor or cognitive function in infants increase the risk for underweight or preterm infants and cause fatigue in adults that impairs their ability to do physical work iron deficiency may also affect memory andor other mental functions in the pediatric population 3image from medscape nail changes can be a clue in diagnosing some vitamin deficiencies koilonychia or spoon nail shown can be associated with iron deficiency and protein deficiency especially deficiency of sulfurcontaining amino acids such as cysteine or methionine 4beads that seem to drip down the nail like wax are associated with vitamin b deficiencies and some endocrine conditions eg diabetes mellitus thyroid disorders and addison disease browngray nails may be associated with vitamin b12 deficiency a central nail ridge may be caused by deficiencies in iron folic acid andor protein 4adapted image from the us department of health and human services nutritional deficiencies may also be apparent in bone compared with normal bone left osteoporotic bone right is very fragile and at increased risk for fractures after even minimal trauma numerous dietary factors influence the balance of bone production secondary osteoporosis may be caused by malnutrition or by an underlying deficiency in calcium magnesium vitamin d or protein this type of osteoporosis affects as many as one third of postmenopausal women as well as numerous men and premenopausal women 5image from gaida je alfredson h kiss zs bass sl cook jl bmc musculoskelet disord

muscle aches and some difficulty ambulating she has not been taking any medications or supplements and no previous bone density screening has been performed dexa scanning reveals a tscore of 25 at the femoral neck her serum 25hydroxyvitamin d 25 ohd level is 15 ngm l and her estimated glomerular filtration rate e grf is 35 m lmin173 m 2 which of the following statements about this patients condition is correct her vitamin d level can be associated with low parathyroid hormone levels she has osteopenia based on her tscore and should be treated with alendronate her vitamin d level is adequate for bone health she has osteoporosis and should be treated with vitamin d followed by denosumab image from wikimedia commons  easchiff answer d she has osteoporosis based on her tscore and should be treated with vitamin d followed by denosumab vitamin d status is best determined by measuring serum 25 ohd a 25 ohd level higher than 32 ngm l contributes to the best calcium absorption and a level higher than 30 ngm l is associated with observed antifracture efficacy 6 the parathyroid hormone level starts to increase when the 25 ohd level is below 31 ngm l and can be considered another marker of insufficiency vitamin d deficiency in adults results in osteomalacia whereas in children it manifests as rickets patients with osteomalacia or rickets should be treated with vitamin d but avoid use of antiresorptive therapy eg alendronate denosumab before correction of the vitamin d deficiency as this treatment could precipitate hypocalcemia 7 a diagnosis of osteoporosis is usually made when other metabolic bones diseases such as osteomalacia from vitamin d deficiency have been ruled out once other conditions have been excluded a tscore of less than 25 based on dexa scanning or the presence of a fragility fracture makes the diagnosis of osteoporosis in this case the patient has renal insufficiency that would preclude the use of bisphosphonates such as alendronate therefore denosumab—after correction of the vitamin d deficiency—is the correct treatment images from medscape rickets shown can occur in children when vitamin d metabolites are deficient 8 vitamin d increases calcium absorption from the small intestine and also boosts phosphorus absorption both are essential for bone mineralization a black child living in a northern climate in an urban setting is at high risk for vitamin d deficiency especially between the months of october and marchapril 9 less commonly a deficiency of calcium or phosphorus may produce rickets image from wikimedia commons  drahreg01 a 45yearold woman recently emigrated from australia to the united states she has constipation of several weeks duration is experiencing increased sensitivity to cold weather and has sustained a weight increase of 10 lb in the past 2 months despite a decreased appetite she also describes subjective fullness in the anterior aspect of her neck shown deficiency ies of which of the following may be responsible for this patients condition iodine copper selenium iodine and selenium all of the above image from medscape answer d iodine and selenium this patient presented with signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism including a goiter shown a goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland resulting from iodine deficiency the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide 10selenium also has a thyroidrelated function it is needed for the conversion of thyroxine t4 into the more active triiodothyronine t3 which the body uses at the cellular level 11image from wikimedia commons  minatanaka concomitant selenium and iodine deficiencies also contribute to kashinbeck disease kbd shown 12 kbd is a chronic endemic osteochondropathy that is prevalent in china its main pathologic feature is necrosis of cartilage symptomssigns of kbd include joint pain morning stiffness disturbances of flexion and extension in the elbows enlarged interphalangeal joints and limited motion in many joints 12 treatment is typically palliative image from open stax cnx rice university  herbert l fred md hendrik a van dijk a 55yearold man presents with the skin changes shown he is taking isoniazid for tuberculosis of the gastrointestinal gi tract he has also been experiencing gi disturbance for a few weeks accompanied by irritability and sadness which of the following statements about this patients condition is the most accurate the skin changes shown are never itchy this condition can resolve spontaneously without treatment supplementation with vitamin b6 pyridoxine prevents this condition this condition is less likely to occur in people who obtain their food energy mainly from maize corn image from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc answer a the skin changes shown are never itchy as signaled by the casal necklace rash shown this patient has pellagra pellagra is often caused by a chronic lack of vitamin b3 niacin in the diet although it can also be a complication of isoniazid therapy and may occur despite pyridoxine supplementation 13 people who obtain most of their food energy from maize corn are commonly affected the primary clinical manifestations of pellagra are the four ds photosensitive d ermatitis d iarrhea d ementia and d eath the dermatologic features of this disorder include desquamation erythema scaling and keratosis of sunexposed areas 13 oral nicotinamide or niacin typically reverses the clinical manifestations of pellagra 13image from medscape a 64yearold woman presents with a rash shown on both legs she has a complex medical history breast cancer recurrent venous thrombosis papillary thyroid cancer anemia leukopenia splenomegaly and bronchiectasis the patient denies experiencing pain itching or trauma and she states that she has had no contact with plants new soaps or lotions she was receiving warfarin for several months with a therapeutic international normalized ratio inr and a platelet count of 177000µl the dietary history reveals that the patient was limiting her intake of fruits and vegetables which of the following is the most likely diagnosis senile purpura idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura vitamin c deficiency excessive anticoagulation with warfarin image from the cdc answer c vitamin c deficiency perifollicular hemorrhage shown is a clue to the presence of vitamin c ascorbic acid deficiency 14 insufficient vitamin c intake causes scurvy an illness characterized by fatigue widespread connective tissue weakness and capillary fragility 1415because it cannot be synthesized by the human body vitamin c is an essential dietary component with deficiencies avoided through consumption of fruits and vegetables or a diet fortified with ascorbic acid 1415image from the cdc the patient in the image presented with scorbutic gums arrow attributable to vitamin c deficiency oral changes associated with vitamin c deficiency include inflammation of the gums gingivitis as well as swollen bleeding gums and loosening or loss of teeth—results of impaired collagen synthesis and subsequently weakened connective tissues 1415vitamin c deficiency is rare in the united states but people who ingest little or no vitamin c ie about 10 mgday for many weeks may get scurvy 15image from the cdc scorbutic tongue is another oral change that can be identified in patients with scurvy this child presented with inflammation of the tongue glossitis shown including areas of erythema and petechial submucosal hemorrhages nutritional deficiencies of which of the following also affect the tongue vitamin b12 and iron folic acid and pyridoxine riboflavin and niacin vitamin a and zinc all of the above image courtesy of medscape  forbes and jackson answer e all of the above a 75yearold woman presents with a lemon yellow pallor and atrophic glossitis smooth shiny appearance of the tongue with loss of filiform papillae shown she also has ataxia and weakness her surgical history is remarkable for a complete gastrectomy 2 years ago a complete blood cell count reveals a hemoglobin level of 10 gd l her peripheral blood smear is shown in the next slide image from medscape this peripheral blood smear is from the patient discussed in the previous slide on the basis of the peripheral blood smear which of the following statements is correct regarding this patients condition her condition is caused by a deficiency in a fat soluble vitamin folate deficiency is the most common cause neurologic signs of her condition include vision problems delirium and dementia macrocytosis of red blood cells is not seen until after megaloblastic changes of the white blood cells the vitamin deficiency in this patient should be treated with oral supplements only image from medscape answer c neurologic signs of her condition include vision problems delirium and dementia the patients peripheral blood smear shown includes anisocytosis macroovalocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils which are consistent with megaloblastic anemia in the united states megaloblastic anemia is most likely due to vitamin b12 deficiency folic acid fortification has made folatedeficient megaloblastic anemia a very rare condition 1618it is crucial to recognize oral changes and other early signs of megaloblastic anemia so that replacement therapy can be initiated before irreversible neurologic effects occur macrocytosis precedes megaloblastic anemia and is more common neurologic signs of megaloblastic anemia include posterior column signs followed by gait disturbances vision problems delirium and dementia 1819 the presence of ataxia and weakness in this patient differentiates vitamin b12 deficiency from folate deficiency patients with vitamin b12 deficiency should be treated with b12 by injection 18 although high doses given via the oral route have been shown to have results similar to those given via injection patient adherence may be an issue image from the cdc a 35yearold man who recently emigrated from kenya to the united states has had eye irritation for several weeks ophthalmologic examination reveals moderate dry eye with excessive mucus formation on the corneal surface and punctate corneal fluorescein staining shown his medical history is significant for gallstones and an attack of acute pancreatitis which of the following statements about this patients nutrient deficiency is the most accurate the kidney is the main site of storage for the deficient nutrient the nutrient is derived only from animal sources the recommended daily allowance of this nutrient for an adult male older than 19 years is 900 mg zinc deficiency may affect the metabolism of the nutrient image from the cdc answer d zinc deficiency may affect the metabolism of the nutrient this patient has vitamin a deficiency vitamin a is a fatsoluble vitamin that plays a role in the epithelial integrity of the eyes the respiratory system and the urinary and intestinal tracts in addition to xerophthalmia dry eyes other early signs of vitamin a deficiency include glossitis and dental caries shown common symptoms and signs of vitamin a deficiency include bitot spots blindness poor adaptation to darkness nyctalopia keratomalacia corneal perforation dry skin follicular hyperkeratosis phrynoderma and pruritus any condition that affects fat absorption may put patients at risk for vitamin a deficiency about 5080 of vitamin a is stored in the liver 20 in general therapy involves administration of oral vitamin a supplements image from medscape a 2yearold girl presents with persistent diarrhea and periorificial skin changes consisting of sharply demarcated brightly erythematous plaques shown her mother also notes that the childs hair is falling out the child was successfully weaned from breast milk at age 5 months her older sibling had the same condition at age 3 years which of the following statements about this patients condition is the most accurate this condition is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner checking the serum alkaline phosphatase level can help in making the diagnosis the nails are always normal in this condition breast milk analysis cannot help in the diagnosis image from medscape answer b checking the serum alkaline phosphatase level can help in making the diagnosis this child has acrodermatitis enteropathica an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder causing zinc deficiency and characterized by periorificial and acral dermatitis alopecia and diarrhea 21 the patients lesions improved a few weeks after treatment with zinc shown in acrodermatitis enteropathica breast milk usually provides sufficient bioavailable zinc in infants until about age 46 months after which complementary foods are required to provide additional zinc 22 measuring the zinc level in breast milk can differentiate between congenital and acquired deficiencies reduced serum alkaline phosphatase levels may indicate zinc deficiency in the presence of a normal serum zinc level 21hypozincemia in adults is usually caused by a dietary deficiency 22 other common causes include malabsorption bariatric surgery diarrhea chronic liverrenal disease sickle cell disease diabetes and cancer 22image from medscape a 62yearold male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is seen in a dental clinic with erythema maceration and fissuring at the corners of the mouth similar to that seen in the image

wikimedia commons  james heilman md answer b vitamin b2angular cheilitis cheilosis or angular stomatitis is an inflammatory lesion at the corner of the mouth shown in severe cases cracks or splits may form and bleed common causes of cheilitis include vitamin b2 riboflavin deficiency 23 iron deficiency anemia anorexia nervosa or bulimia plummervinson syndrome weather chapped lips infections commonly fungal and medications that dry the skin eg isotretinoin 24riboflavin deficiency rarely occurs in the united states owing to dietary fortification of many foods 25 when it arises it is usually in the presence of other vitamin b deficiencies 23 oral intake of vitamin b2 is typically used to manage riboflavin deficiency common sources of riboflavin in western diets include oats and breakfast cereals yogurt milk clams mushrooms almonds and eggs 2325images from busani s bonvecchio c gaspari a et al bmc res notes 20147718 open access pmid 25312751 pmcid pmc4209069 a middleaged woman presents with

in the following days brain imaging studies revealed the findings shown which of the following statements about the patients condition is correct the above condition is caused by a deficiency in a fatsoluble vitamin that is absorbed in the jejunum the leading cause of the above condition in the developed world is gastric bypass surgery the bodys reserve of the involved nutrient can be depleted after 20 days of inadequate supply the ocular symptoms are irreversible images from busani s bonvecchio c gaspari a et al bmc res notes 20147718 open access pmid 25312751 pmcid pmc4209069 answer c the bodys reserve of the involved nutrient can be depleted after 20 days of inadequate supply 26this patient has thiamine deficiency resulting in wernicke encephalopathy beriberi is the most common and classic finding of thiamine deficiency 27 the leading cause of thiamine deficiency in the developed world is alcoholism 26 approximately 40 of alcoholics have polyneuropathy and up to 13 proceed to wernicke encephalopathy 28 other causes of thiamine deficiency are starvation hyperemesis gravidarum and bariatric surgery 27 primarily affecting patients during the first 6 months after surgery when individuals undergo the most weight loss administration of supplemental thiamine typically parenterally generally resolves beriberi 2930the computed tomography ct scan on the top left demonstrates

some nutritional deficiencies often present with anemia that on peripheral smear examination demonstrates the same hematologic characteristics found on smears associated with myelodysplastic syndromes mds with ring sideroblasts present nutritional deficiencies of which of the following can present with the type of anemia shown in the image above iron copper lead vitamin b3 and iron vitamin b6 and copper image from datta ak ghosh t nayak k ghosh m cases j 20081 1158 open access pmid 18801184 pmcid pmc2559824 answer e vitamin b6 and copper vitamin b6 pyridoxine is involved in among other functions protein metabolism and heme synthesis 31 pyridoxine deficiency can result in sideroblastic anemia copper deficiency although rare can arise in combination with other nutritional deficiencies and can be seen in patients with a history of remote gastric bypass surgery or a malabsorptive disorder 32 clinical features of copper deficiency include fragile abnormally formed hair skin depigmentation anemia myeloneuropathy hepatosplenomegaly and osteoporosis 3236 neurologic manifestations may mimic those of vitamin b12 deficiency menkes kinky hair disease as seen in the infant above is a rare xlinked recessive disorder that occurs when the transport protein mediating copper uptake from the intestine mutates it results in severe copper deficiency that manifests early in infancy 37 note lead poisoning but not lead deficiency can also lead to the type of sideroblastic anemia seen in the previous slide image from medscape a newborn baby has a myelomeningocele or a neural tube defect ntd shown deficiency of which nutrient during pregnancy can result in this condition vitamin b12folate thiamine selenium zinc image from medscape answer b folate the etiology of myelomeningocele shown in an infant and other ntds in most cases is multifactorial and includes genetic environmental and nutritional causes folate deficiency 37 up to 50 of cases of ntds are related to folate deficiency which makes these conditions potentially preventable by folate intake during pregnancy 37the food and nutrition board of the institute of medicine recommends an intake of 400 mcgday of folate for women aged 14 years or older and 600mcgday for pregnant women 38 the us public health service and the cdc recommend 400 mcgday of folic acid for women of childbearing age and the us preventive services task force recommends a 400800 mcg daily folic acid supplement for all women who are planning a pregnancy or are capable of becoming pregnant 39conditions that may exacerbate folate deficiency include malabsorptive disorders and the use of certain drugs such as phenytoin sulfonamides and methotrexate 17image from wikimedia commons  foiltape a young child presents to the pediatrician with yellowish discoloration of the skin which is more visible on the nose under artificial light shown and on the palms of the hands but spares the sclera and mucous membranes which of the following conditions is known to cause the above clinical picture hypothyroidism ingestion of large amounts of carrots diabetes mellitus liver disease all of the above images from wikimedia commons  norge0209 answer e all of the above carotenemia before left and after right excessive consumption of carotene was discontinued is shown above carotenemia and carotenoderma result from deposition of beta carotene a provitamin a from plant sources in the fat soluble stratum corneum 40 the yellowish discoloration of the skin is first observed on the nose nasolabial folds palms of the hands soles of the feet and then eventually the entire body however the sclera and mucous membranes are spared—which distinguishes it from jaundice 40carotenemia is particularly common among infants and toddlers who eat large amounts of puréed vegetables particularly carrots and sweet potatoes 40 other less common causes include diabetes mellitus hypothyroidism anorexia nervosa and hepatorenal diseases due to the decreased conversion of beta carotene to retinol carotenemia is a benign condition and elimination of carotenerich foods results in the gradual disappearance of the yellowish discoloration 40 provitamin a is not highly regulated and is very unlikely to cause vitamin a toxicity more slideshows start testicular disorders trouble doesnt always come in pairs the testes are
