offensewhat is slander slander is just one form of defaming someone’s character defamation of character is the intentional making of statements or publishing information or pictures for the purpose of harming another person’s reputation slander is a defamatory statement that is spoken rather than published in writing or art in order to qualify as slander in a legal action the statement must be false and maliciously made in most cases the statement must have been presented as fact rather than the speaker’s opinion laws governing slander and other types of defamation vary slightly by state

the plaintiff ’s reputation the plaintiff may be awarded monetary damages examples of slander in order to qualify as slander the statement must be untrue but told to others as though it were true additionally people are allowed to have and express their opinions these are statements that the person at least believes to be true examples of slander include claiming a person is gay lesbian or bisexual when it is untrue in an attempt to harm his or her reputation telling someone that a certain person cheated on his taxes or committed tax fraud saying that a certain person had an affair with a supervisor or manager in order to receive a promotion this may be considered slander against two peopletelling coworkers a madeup or unverified story about a certain person stealing from petty cash claiming that a certain person has a sexually transmitted disease statements that are not slander making statements of fact or which the speaker truly believes to be truthful is not considered to be slander additionally statements that express a person’s opinion are also not considered to be slander though that is a fine line to walk making a damaging statement while saying “that’s just my opinion” does not always convince a judge that the speaker’s intent wasn’t malicious the following are examples of statements that are not slander stating that a certain coworker is incompetent at his job which makes it difficult for the speaker to do his own job well telling a group of friends that the food at a certain local restaurant is the worst the speaker has ever had broadcasting on a radio talk show that the customer service at a particular furniture store is terrible based on the speaker’s personal experiencetelling everyone within hearing range at a basketball game that a certain person is a terrible lover again based on the speaker’s personal experienceslander vs libel slander and libel are types of defamation of character which differ only in the way the false and malicious statements are made both refer to statements made to hurt a person’s reputation or his standing in the community both are false declarations made out of malice or for personal gain slander refers to defamatory statements made verbally whether directly to other people facetoface or by phone voicemail or broadcast libel refers to defamatory statements made in writing expressed in print or through symbols or art the elements of defamation untrue statements made in malice or for personal gain are the same for both slander and libel in both the individual must have suffered some harm due to the defamatory statements in order to have a valid legal claim for example sidney is angry with her exhusband nathan when she sends him an email venting all of her anger she makes statements in the email about all of his misdeeds and calling him a lying cheating diseaseridden psychopath who shouldn’t be allowed to even be near children not being satisfied with the email venting sidney leaves the same message on nathan’s cell phone voicemail it so happens that nathan is a pediatrician who works at a local children’s hospital as this email added fuel to the fire of nathan’s anger as well he files a civil lawsuit for defamation of character against sidney at trial nathan accuses sidney of defamation by slander as well as libel as she said those terrible things both verbally into his voicemail and in writing to his email nathan testifies that these statements especially the statement that he should not be allowed near children have destroyed his reputation and may cost him his job as a pediatrician by questioning both parties carefully the judge is able to determine that both the email and voicemail accounts are nathan’s personal accounts and are not likely to be heard or viewed by the public his employer or his coworkers nathan is unable to produce a single witness to testify that sidney published any of these defamatory statements directly to other people or left them on unsecure voicemail or email systems while there is no question that both of these parties are angry with one another or that sidney said hurtful things nathan has suffered no damages that might be recompensed by the court which is a requirement to win a defamation lawsuit proving slander because slander involves spoken insults which leave a distinct lack of written proof proving slander can be a challenge not only does the plaintiff need to prove that the false and malicious statements were made but those statements must meet certain criteria if any of these criteria are not met the court may dismiss the case and the victim will not be able to recover damages the slanderous statements mustbe communicated intentionally or in a negligent manner to someone elseharm the other person’s reputationdirectly point to the person being defamed though the reference may be implied slander against public officials public officials often have a difficult time proving they have been slandered this is because society has assumed the attitude that these people have put themselves and their lives in the spotlight and the public has a right to criticize them this idea comes from the notion that people have a right to have an opinion about and even to criticize those who govern or rule them the modern legal system offers public figures and government officials the least amount of protection against slander and other types of defamation should a public figure seek legal a legal remedy for defamation he would need to prove not only the standard elements of defamation but that the statement was made in actual malice or with an agenda this might include a rival public official making defamatory statements in an attempt to remove his opponent from the political landscape defenses to slander a person who has been accused of slander or libel has a few options for defending himself in court defenses to slander depend on the circumstances and are not always successful but being able to prove for instance that the statement was untrue is a good start in a legal action for defamation the following defenses to slander and libel may get the defendant off the hook truth as the most commonly used and successful defense to defamation truth requires showing that the derogatory statement made was false if the statement made by the other person was true even if his broadcasting it hurt the plaintiff’s reputation he has no basis for a lawsuit opinion showing the court that a defamatory statement made was simply an expression of the defendant’s personal opinion provides a defense to a defamation lawsuit the right to freedom of expression allows all people to express their opinions about things even if those opinions are unflattering or downright harm another person’s reputation the necessary element here is to show that the statement was not made with malice or with the intent to harm the other person also the statement must be true or the speaker must believe it to be true example of slander vs opinion jaime hates the food at carlo’s restaurant and she expresses her opinion on yelp and facebook saying that the tacos she had were toothbreaking hard and the enchiladas completely flavorless she added that she and her party only saw their waitress twice once when she took their orders and then again as she dropped off the overpriced check because jaime fancies herself a budding “critic around town” she has many followers who see and begin commenting on her posts restaurant owner carlo becomes aware that a young woman is telling people bad things about his establishment both by talking it up and online when carlo notices a definite dropoff in business he files a civil lawsuit for defamation of his business at trial carlo brings a server who heard jaime talking to people about the restaurant saying these things and he presented the yelp and facebook posts in the end the judge ruled in favor of jaime as the comments she made could only be seen as her opinion she did not make false statements presenting them as truth and her published opinions are well within her first amendment rights on the other hand had jaime made statements that carlo’s restaurant apparently uses dog meat in their tacos and enchiladas and the waitress apparently kept her job by giving sexual favors to the boss the judge’s decision would likely have gone the other way in this example of slander the statements are not based in fact but are prompted by jaime’s desire to make sensational accusations whether in malice or in an effort to attract more followers consent if the defendant can prove that the plaintiff consented to the publication of the defamatory statement to others he has no basis for a defamation lawsuit privilege privilege gives a person accused of defamation whether by slander or libel immunity from civil liability privilege in this context is not a blanket term as there are different types of privilege and different levels of

conditional privilege may apply include a statement made for the purpose of protecting a third person a statement made to protect the publisher’s interest a statement made to protect the wellbeing of a family member slander lawsuit while a few states recognize extreme cases of defamation as a crime prosecutions are rare even in those jurisdictions slander and libel are considered to be civil wrongs for which the law considers a monetary award to be a sufficient remedy for a wronged individual in fact while a successful plaintiff in a slander lawsuit may be awarded money the court generally cannot force the defendant to retract the statement or to publish an apology the laws governing defamation lawsuits vary by state subject only to the free speech provisions of the first amendment to the u s constitution while the elements of defamation tend to be the same throughout the states the procedures and remedies available often differ by far the most common remedy in a slander lawsuit is an award of monetary damages though it is possible for the court to award punitive damages punitive damages are ordered not in compensation for the plaintiff’s loss but to punish the defendant or to dissuade him from taking similar actions in the future although punitive damages are about punishing the defendant this monetary amount is also paid to the plaintiff example of
