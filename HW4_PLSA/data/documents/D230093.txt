alveolar osteitis is a painful dental condition that sometimes happens after you have a permanent adult tooth extracted dry socket is when the blood clot at the site of the tooth extraction fails to develop or it dislodges or dissolves before the wound has healed normally a blood clot forms at the site of a tooth extraction this blood clot serves as a protective layer over the underlying bone and nerve endings in the empty tooth socket the clot also provides the foundation for the growth of new bone and for the development of soft tissue over the clot exposure of the underlying bone and nerves results in intense pain not only in the socket but also along the nerves radiating to the side of your face the socket becomes inflamed and may fill with food debris adding to the pain if you develop dry socket the pain usually begins one to three days after your tooth is removed dry socket is the most common complication following tooth extractions such as the removal of third molars wisdom teeth

or slow healing and contaminate the wound site the act of sucking on a cigarette may physically dislodge the blood clot prematurely oral contraceptives high estrogen levels from oral contraceptives
