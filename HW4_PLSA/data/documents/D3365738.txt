food based natural b vitamin and that did the trick for me in about 36 hours i thought about the scurvy issue and that may be likely as i dont take vitamin c any more since i found out that almost all c supplements are synthetic which is why they are doses in the 1000s if you get the real vitamin c you only need a 50100 mg or less so i dont know for positive that i didnt get more c in my diet and stop it anyway hope this helps troy anonymous 42789 replies may 9 2007 0702 pm 0 0flag this response so glad i found this website  searching in desperation for a remedy for my 77 year old husband who is being driven mad by sore tongue and doctors dentists antismoking counsellors of 30 yrs experience  nobody had ever heard of this and could offer nothing that helps after a bad bout of bronchitis and antibiotics to clear that condition he decided to stop smoking after 65 years he used nicotine patches for a couple of days then went cold turkey he sucked lots of boiled sweets first few days until a sore tongue prompted him to stop the sweets has been cigarette free now nearly 10 weeks and coping well but tongue is so bad hes close to breaking point thing is last time he stopped smoking about 5 years ago same thing happened and he did go back smoking and within a few days the tongue got better he has tried 2 courses of nystatin drops cordysol mouthwashteatree oil as mouthwash and relies on plain yogurt to soothe tongue this sore stinging dry tongue and swollen lips keeps him awake also using denture fixatives while awaiting new dentures  tried several gels in case one was causing an allergy tried ambesol without success could this be psychosomatic anonymous 42789 replies may 10 2007 0454 pm 0 0flag this response hi my mother has been suffering from burning mouth gums and lips for over ten years eight of those years she was living in florida with my dad where they spent 2 years going to at least 20 different doctors or dental specialists no real relief and all the different meds they put her on has burned out her brain she has been on all the mouthwashes used herbs and healing supplements and of course all the drugs given to her by clueless doctors and no real relief i moved them up th nc and they live up the street from us in the first year they were here i took mom from a nutritionalist to a facial pain doctor to acue puncturist to a hypnotist and then to duke diagnostic center for pain nobody has helped her at this point i feel her nerves are damaged and sending pain messages to her mouth 247 i keep her on an antidepressant and give her lunesta to sleep as well as the daily cycles of mouthwashes and vitamin b but nothing ever seems to give any real relief our dentist has given her 10 shots of lidocaine at a time and after 3 hours the pain is back the ripoff facial pain guy charged hundreds for dollars for each visit and did less for my mom than the regular dentist i think this burning mouth should be called neurapathy of the mouth i have an aunt and friend whose nerves are burning in their feet and i feel this is what mom has in her mouth if morphine and codeine dont make a dent in the pain then i think she needs some type of lasar treatment in the mouth to sever some of these burning nerves i havent found anyone willing to do this even at duke they tried numbing her from the neck up and in a few hours the pain was back i thought i could help her but in almost 3 yars i havent found anyone a friend of mine watched a show about people in germany who had nerve pain and wer put into comas for 5 days once they wewre brought out of the coma their nerves had returned to normal and their pain was gone their areas of pain were in the leg and on the face but i keep wondering if it would help people with mouth pain any thoughts or feedback i would be glad to hear from you anonymous 42789 replies may 13 2007 0218 pm 0 0flag this response i just went to the er this morning for the same thing i noticed my tongue felt burnt also the er doc told me that when you take an extensive amount of antibiotics they can kill the good bacteria in your mouth then there are no good bacteria to kill off infections and such i was given one pill of diflucan and a majic mouth washwhich consists of ladicaine benadryl mylanta etc im praying this works my tongue feels horrible anonymous 42789 replies may 13 2007 0749 pm 0 0flag this response its been a couple of months now but no change the sweetish liquid the doctor gave me for thrush did nothing ive tried probiotics thinking that perhaps antibiotics had killed off the good bacteria no change i take good balanced multivitamins daily and eat a balanced diet so i dont think it is a vitamin deficiency my symptoms are not as bad as some that i have read here its annoying to me and reduces the joy i find in food but it isnt enough to keep me up at night and is only mindly painful at times the burning gets worse when i eat hard cheeses or drink wine which suggests an intolerance or allergy for sulfites it doesnt really explain why it never completely goes away though perhaps the cause is something else and the sulfites just aggravate the symptoms sad because wine and cheese are two of my favorite things in life anonymous 42789 replies may 22 2007 0155 pm 0 0flag this response this is almost a month that my mouth tastes funny all day long i have this dry mouth

the web about a totally unrelated topic still not sure how i got here i was in a hurry and only glanced at the messages but later i thought i should tell you about how i cleared up a similiar problem had a helluva time finding this page i had a split from side to side in the center of my tongue and red splotches around the rim there was the sensation of having burnt it with hot food here is what i did at most any drugstore or walmart shudder you can buy acidophilus for 6 or 7 dollars they are caplets crush it up and hold it in your mouth on the front of your tongue and under the tongue the longer the better i noticed a remarkable improvement within 12 hours did it twice and the problem went away what is it lactobacillus acidophilus  l acidophilus  is the most commonly used probiotic or friendly bacteria it isnt a drug your own body produces this but sometimes there are areas that dont have the right amount having had this problem ive done a lot of research on it no where that i can find does it suggest doing this but being desperate i tried it and it worked im interested to know if this works for you trey anonymous 42789 replies july 6 2007 0315 am 1 0flag this response hi my sister suffered with the same thing except she went through 5 doctors specialists and 8 months later she was diagnosed with oral lichen planus it took a dental pathologist to diagnose her and now she treats it with a topical solution and some other meds she will always have it but it is only bad when it flares up they think she may have been predisposed to lichen planus but the whitening agents in toothpastes and mouthwashes exacerbate it anonymous 42789 replies july 16 2007 0029 am 0 0flag this response for a lot of us here look in candidas overgrowth i have the same problem it gets worse when

havent been to see a doctor yet but given that my tongue is white coated and that i also often have thrush and a number of other yeast related ailments im guessing it may be related to candida

lastafter an eternity of looking for someone with the same symptoms ive found you all thought i was going nuts with this tongue was told it was the acid refluxwhich i have that was causing the sinus

wondered is this going to be constant or is there remission periods anonymous 42789 replies august 7 2007 0240 am 0 0flag this response hi there update since my tongue roof of mouth and throat has been burning since i took colloidal silver its been almost 4 months now and actually in the last few days relief is in sight i have been seeing a kiniesiologist who works out of his home who does muscle testing and asks body what the problem is of course my symptoms were from the colloidal silver and body was allergic and suffered some damage but the good news is that now that i am eating things that my body wants which includes much in season cooked vegetables no sugars limited fruit and lime juice in water along with folic acid ginseng garlic and gelatin and a digestive enzyme my tongue is improving substantially and the acid reflux has also settled down to just an itching feeling in my esophogus now if this worked for me thats great but i am not suggesting that these remedies would be the same for you but i do recommend muscle testing and finding out what it is your body is wanting and lacking if anyone is interested i could find out the total background of the testing and update this to people interested the relief is a godsend and i hope the best for all who suffer with the bms mercury 2 replies august 8 2007 0337 am 0 0flag this response i had the same thing occur during antibiotic treatment with zithromax for a sinus infection it was so weird i almost asked my dr if that was a known side effect but i looked it up myself and it wasnt in the literature i agree it seems it could be candidathrush rebound from antibiotics also i know you can get sore mouth from lack of vitamin c scurvy and there also is a tie in to b vitamins also like mentioned in this thread already some people dont absorb enough vitamins even if they are getting a normal amount in their diet so they need to supplement that anonymous 42789 replies august 14 2007 0131 am 0 0flag this response i am 42 years old after taking zithromax in march of 2006 for a sinus infection  my tongue felt funny for a few months and in june of 2006 my tongue became white and burning we thought it was thrush the cultures were negative tho but after treating that onoff for a year  i still have a constant burn in my tongue roof and lip zinc supplements seems to help for about a month but then it came back i was also diagnosed with sjogrens syndrome i am curious how many people got this condition after using antibiotics i think the antibiotics started the process and can anyone comment on if at any point the symptoms just completely went away a few doctors said it can go away as strangely as it started but i havent heard of anyone that has happened to i feel very frustrated because i feel completely fine except for this burning sensation if anyone can write back if they have had any success stories or information they can share  that would be helpful i have tried probitics but it hasnt been that helpfulthanks anonymous 42789 replies august 23 2007 0549 pm 0 0flag this response i have had a sore tongue for about 6 months now i think it started after i took a course of antibiotics called cefalexin for cystitis but it may have started after a course of lansoprazole that i took for acid reflux at about the same time i have had a lot of ailments lately  going through the change i went to my doctor about my tongue but he said he can see nothing wrong but it is white and a bit cracked he said that was normal anyway he prescribed an anti thrush lozenge thing which has not worked it really gets me down in the morning the tongue is so dry and white i just want it back as it was i think i will try extra vitamin b as someone suggests here i will let you know how it goes anonymous

steady use of claritin for allergy and protonix for excess acid these mouth symptoms are really strange feelingit is comforting to know others know what im talking about noticed someone mentioned whitening agents exacerbate lichen planus and i have used the whitening strips to brighten teeth  but never had this side effect before wish you all well anonymous 42789 replies september 5 2007 0248 am 0 0flag this response i too like you all have the same symptoms and have had for about 12 months now its driving me mad but reading everyones posts helps to know that im not alone anyone who finds out what this is will be revered im sure i too am sceptical that this may have been drug induced as i have had antibiotics and antiinflamatory meds last year before this started it came on very suddenly after eating a chinese meal i mention this because i hadnt had one in a very long time and at first thought i might have a food intolerance to something i ate ive seen my gp several times had mouth wash bloods taken you name it  not b vitamin deficient ie pernicious anaemia or diabetic its constantly on my mind all the time feels burnt sometimes worse than other times im treating myself with corsadyl now and whilst my tongue looks better its made no difference really to the burning sensation other symptoms ive experienced have been that my tongue has had a whitish coating pie crust like appearance all the way round it fissures and very reddened edges and tip additionally ive had a metallic taste in my mouth my husband said one day that my breath smelt like iodine i also thought my saliva was becoming more acidic as it was affecting the enamel of my teeth feeling like it was being worn away so i started using a new type of toothpaste specially for this called proenamel which helps also i have had acid reflux tremendous pain behind sternum which the gp treated sucessfully however i am now also getting abdominal cramps infrequently am very very flatulent and have intermittent sore eyes as if i have hayfever we live rurally so i have even contemplated whether i might be affected by the sprays that the farmers use on their fieldsi do however have polycystic kidney disease and polycystic ovary syndrome susan anonymous 42789 replies september 10 2007 0923 pm 0 0flag this response i have been experiencing much of what the others have posted except that i really did burn my tongue i burnt it on a brown sugar syrup i was cooking and foolishly tasted however it never healed or at least the sensation never went away and i am experiencing an uncomfortable sensation on the inside of my lower and sometimes upper lip the sensation on my tongue is also at the tip of my tongue as others have described i have been dealing with it for about 6 months at first it was really unbearable but is better when i do not eat sugar or drink coffee i have thought of thrush because i get mild but recurring yeast infections unless i am on a yeaststarving diet or at least do not drink coffee or eat any sugar the yeast infections go away as my hormones return to normal after ovulation or menstration and i dont always get them i read on another site that the burning tongueacid mouth can be caused by an increased acidity in the body due to toxins produced by fungi the site recommends using baking soda to reduce acidity and peroxidewater mouth wash i have had some relief using these remmedies the past 2 days we have been remodeling a very old house so i am sure i have been exposed to molds and the onset of this seems to correspond to when we started
