from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search the bachelor of engineering abbreviated as b e b eng or b a i in latin form is a first professional undergraduateacademic degree awarded to a student after four to five years of studying engineering at an accredited university in the uk a b eng degree will be accredited by one of the engineering councils professional engineering institutions as suitable for registration as a incorporated engineer or chartered engineer with further study to masters level in canada the degree from a canadian university can be accredited by the ceab alternatively it might be accredited directly by another professional engineering institution such as the u s based institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee the b eng contributes to the route to chartered engineer uk registered engineer or licensed professional engineer and has been approved by representatives of the profession a b e has a greater emphasis on engineering science for example electronics and electrical circuits than the b sc however topics covered in b e can overlap with b sc most universities in the united states and europe award the bachelor of science engineering b sc eng  bachelor of engineering b eng  bachelor of engineering science b eng sc  bachelor of science in engineering b s e or bachelor of applied science b a sc degree to undergraduate students of engineering study for example canada is the only country that awards the b a sc degree for graduating engineers other institutions award engineering degrees specific to the area of study such as b s e e  bachelor of science in electrical engineering and bsme bachelor of science in mechanical engineering 1a less common and possibly the oldest variety of the degree in the englishspeaking world is baccalaureus in arte ingeniaria b a i  a latin name meaning bachelor in the art of engineering 2 here baccalaureus in arte ingeniaria implies an excellence in carrying out the art or function of an engineer the degree is awarded by the university of dublin its trinity college dublin has had a school of engineering since 1841 and also by the constituent universities of the national university of ireland n u i  citation needed but in everyday speech it is more commonly referred to as bachelor of engineering and the n u i graduates also use the postnomials translated into english b e even though the actual degree and its parchment is in latin  citation needed some south african universities refer to their engineering degrees as b ing  baccalaureus ingenieurswese

course through some universities the institution of engineers australia  engineers australia accredits degree courses and graduates of accredited courses are eligible for membership of the institution bachelor of engineering graduates may commence work as a graduate professional engineer upon graduation although some may elect to undertake further study such as a masters or doctoral degree chartered professional engineer cpeng status or the various state registration requirements are usually obtained in later years graduates with formal engineering qualifications in australia are often referred to as professional engineers to distinguish them from other professions where the term engineer is used loosely bangladesh  editin bangladesh there are two types of degree are offered in

and maintains the standards of accreditation among canadian undergraduate engineering programs graduates of those programs are deemed by the profession to have the required academic qualifications to be licensed as professional engineers in canada 8 this practice is intended to maintain standards of education and allow mobility of engineers in different provinces of canada 9a ceabaccredited degree is the minimum academic requirement for registration as a professional engineer anywhere in the country and the standard against which all other engineering academic qualifications are measured 10 graduation from an accredited program which normally involves four years of study is a required first step to becoming a professional engineer regulation and accreditation are accomplished through a selfgoverning body the name of which varies from province to province which is given the power by statute to register and discipline engineers as well as regulate the field of engineering in the individual provinces graduates of nonceabaccredited programs must demonstrate that their education is at least equivalent to that of a graduate of a ceabaccredited program 10germany  editin germany the bachelor of engineering was introduced as part of implementation of the bologna process however this degree is in fact mostly offered by german fachhochschule institutions universities of applied

universities of applied sciences  ammattikorkeakoulu grant professional bachelors degrees  insinööri amk  the degree does not traditionally prepare for further study but due to the bologna process a completely new degree of ylempi insinööri yamk has been introduced for engineers who wish to continue studying after some work experience before 2005 academic universities see education in finland did not make an administrative distinction between studies on the bachelors and masters level and the masters level diplomiinsinööri was the first degree to be received due to the bologna process an

instead of the beng degree india  editin india the bachelor of engineering degree is a professional engineering undergraduate degree awarded after completion of four years of engineering study and research institutes of national importance like indian institute of technology iit and national institute of technology nit offer bachelor of technology btech degree since the courses they offer are exclusively engineering related some indian universities mainly private institutes which are affiliated to regional universities offer engineering degree under the name of bachelor of engineering b eng but whichever name is used the degree course follows the standard curriculum laid down by the all india council for technical education aicte and the university grants commission india ugc in general universities offer b tech and colleges affiliated to universities will offer as be however there is no difference in the programme objectives and learning outcomes of b e or b tech eligibility

in engineering bengbing for afrikaans universities or b sc eng is awarded to a student who has completed four years course in engineering which consists of eight semesters the degree is regulated by ecsa engineering council of south africa in south africa the b tech is awarded by universities of technology and comprehensive universities  as distinct from traditional universities  and is generally practice or career oriented as opposed to academically oriented relatedly it is often offered in areas in which there is no corresponding b sc or bcomm eg b tech forestry management 3 b tech explosives management 4 the degree is obtained after 4 years of study and is usually offered as a 1year programme following completion of a relevant threeyear national diploma the b tech often carries the same points as other bachelors degrees in terms of south africas national qualifications framework at the same time however due to its orientation it does not usually grant admission to the corresponding m sc or mcomm program 5 and students instead pursue the master of technology m tech and doctor of technology d tech degrees it does grant admission to mba programmes see list of business
