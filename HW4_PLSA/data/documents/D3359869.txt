reach out to a dedicated audience of professional graduate and training clinical psychologists get resultshome  wiki  what clinical psychologists do  a week in the life of a qualified clinical psychologist childa week in the life of a qualified clinical psychologist childqualified cp what i do in a typical week ive been asked about this a couple of times by private message and it has also now been asked on a thread it is also often something i get asked when i speak to people on the path to cp so i thought id give a pen picture of what i do in a typical week if i get a chance i will ask some friends and colleagues if they are prepared to do the same and add them on later in the thread monday i typically spend the day in the base for children looked after once a month i go to a meeting where we review the children in all the local childrens homes on other weeks i consult with staff in one of the homes or meet with young people there they can be quite hard to engage so i often do this informally by dropping in for lunch chatting about tv or playstation games etc i sometimes attend school meetings see individual children who are in foster or adoptive families or do oneoff assessments and i score questionnaires that we use to screen mental health needs in the afternoon i supervise an ap if i have one and offer clinical supervision to two clinical nurse specialists who work with looked after adopted and vulnerable children im also doing some research relating to lac and attachment issues tuesday i have cycles in which i offer and then evaluate a group to help nonbirthparentcarers learn about behaviour management in an attachment context i often attend professionals meetings or case conferences i try to catch up on admin doing dictating writing reports preparing any teaching i am doing responding to emails and telephone messages etc i sometimes do psychometric assessments of young people with complex needs and i am collecting some of these for research purposes if i can i try to read a paper or chapter relevant to my work  but i dont often manage it wednesday i offer consultation appointments in the morning to professionals working with adoption in a social services base normally i meet the social worker link worker or other professional but sometimes i do oneoff sessions with adoptive or foster carers or assessments of children to advise on their placement needs there are usually two or three appointments plus a short meeting with the permanence team manager in the afternoon i do a joint clinic with a consultant psychiatrist where we consider cases where there is likely to be a neurodevelopmental component such as asd this leads to lots of followup psychometry i see two or three cases in the joint clinic using a room in the hospital outpatients department once a month we have a departmental meeting for child psychology at lunchtime the other weeks we have a teamreferral meeting for the miniteam that work with looked after and adopted children thursday i attend the mdt meeting and psychology allocation meeting once every 34 weeks i get supervision from the head of department for an hour i then see families in the afternoon i normally schedule three or four appointments these rotate between being a joint asd clinic with the community paediatricians a neurodevelopmental clinic with a psychiatrist and joint mdt cases or individual therapy cases friday i see clients for psychometric assessment andor therapy followup appointments in the morning once a month i meet colleagues for a journal clubpeer supervision over lunch lapsed i then spend some time keeping on top of my research and working on disseminating the results at the moment this has been preparing and presenting it to various groups working on papers for publication seeking further funding i also try to do some admin and respond to emails and telephone messages general in amongst all of that i teach two days a year on a local clinical training course and a similar amount on a local msc course about 4 times a year i teach an internal seminar and i teach a few more days a year about asdmental health on rolling training programs i also go to a few strategy meetings and professional groupings relating to my main areas of clinical responsibility im also involved in the bps network for cps working with looked after and adopted children and go to the national meeting 3 days per year i occasionally go to the local sig child meeting too i probably spend 5 further days per year attending other training myself for cpd i generally work from 930am until 530pm i have some flexibility in exactly how i configure my hours my appointments with clients typically last around an hour i guess you can see that i don’t do that much direct therapy but to some extent that has been my choice a lot of my colleagues do much more therapy by proportion i do a lot of indirect work and assessment and multiprofessional clinics and teaching and research and something had to give i think this is partly due to a particular pattern of demand within the service and partly to do with my own interests i do try to keep a few ongoing therapy cases as they can be quite satisfying and use a different skillset these tend to be based on cat or cbt type models and be mostly teenagers i review the proportions of different types of work fairly regularly in supervision i think almost all clinical psychologists do some supervision consultation andor teaching so it is good not to forget about these skills when you detail your experience on clinical course applications however the core work is often seen as the clinical role both in terms of direct client work and indirect work i think people naively assume that clinical work is only the face to face stuff but i do assessment formulation and intervention with clients i have never met in consultation with the professionals who are involved with them it is the same set of skills just applied to another persons observations rather than your own you can also intervene in a systemicorganisational way and be part of the clinical process for example being involved in prioritising and allocating cases based on a simple working formulation of what seems to be going on i forgot to say that along with most of the other staff in our service i am on a rota two or three times every month where i see young people who were admitted to the childrens ward via ae because of selfharm the assessment is conducted the day after admission once the person is physically fit for discharge to assess whether they are psychologically fit for discharge and what kind of mental health followup is appropriate if i have the capacity and the issues the young person presents dont suggest a better match with someone else in the service i like to follow up the young people who need therapy myself as they tend to be very interesting cases i am on two strategy groups one to develop regional standards for asd assessment and diagnosis in school aged children another to think about attachment services and how to increase thinking about psychological factors when placing children outside their family of origin particularly in permanent adoptive placements oh and im trying to write up several aspects of my research for publication it might be good if other people can post a day in their life onto this thread qualified cps and if there was another thread to think about a day in the life of aps support workers and other psychology graduate posts im sure i havent covered everything but that should give a bit of the flavour of what i do if you have any questions ill do my best to answer them here is a colleague’s description of what she does i work as a child clinical psychologist and what i do on a daytoday basis can vary hugely i do some work with looked after children lac some work with children and families who are deaf and some general child mental health work the lac work i do is often with staff or carers rather than the children themselves this can be frustrating at times but is because lac children have so many people coming and going from their lives that it isn’t necessarily helpful to have another one unless it is important i work with one residential unit and go to their team meetings to talk about the children they have and the difficulties the staff team have a lot of what i do in that job is try to make staff who often have no psychological understanding at all start to think about why a child might be acting in a particular way occasionally i do some individual work with the young people themselves but that generally tends to be assessment i also do some consultation to people at present only nurses working with children in foster care that is quite varied and what i’m trying to do is help the nurses and the foster carers understand where a child’s difficulties come from and what things they can do to help a child get past those i could do that kind of work without ever meeting a child but it can still be interesting i know british sign language and have an interest in children and families who are deaf that doesn’t make up very much of my job at the moment i go to weekly meetings with the children’s hearing clinic and will talk with the staff about children they are concerned about sometimes it is only giving them ideas at other times we will agree that i should see the child that might be with a paediatrician or it might be alone most of the children who are deaf in northampton don’t sign so i mostly talk to them usually my general clinical skills but adapting it slightly to take into account what i know about deafness for example i would expect their speech development to be slower to be more prone to abusebullying to have a poorer level of ‘emotional literacy’ to find it more difficult to understand people when they are tired and therefore more likely to get frustrated i also try to be aware of any children referred to the service who are deaf so that i can find out the information that the clinician’s need and make sure that a child’s deafness is taken into account the rest of my time is generally seeing children or families i do a mixture of seeing families in our rooms at home or at school mostly it is at our rooms though the first time we meet i’ll meet with the whole family and try to get an idea of what the difficulties are as well as the family structure and the child’s developmental history that tends to decide what will happen next i might work only with the parents to help them develop skills to help their child i do quite a lot of work with children individually and because i have an interest in younger children this often involves playing drawing or telling stories if i’m working individually with a child i’m often trying to help them develop strategies so that they can overcome their difficulties this will often involve feeding back to the family and trying to develop conversations within the family because at the end of the day the child goes home and the family need to understand enough to help the child with whatever they are trying to do i may also undertake some individual assessment with a child to see if they have any learning difficulties or disabilities the great thing about working as a clinical psychologist is that you are in a very privileged position and are often told information that noone else in the family may know the difficulties are that it is emotionally very demanding and that you get to see what i call ‘the dark side’ of life some people go through their lives without ever really believing some of that stuff happens in our world as a psychologist you don’t get that luxury personally i love what i do and particularly love the variety of working with children it’s a job i recommend but realise that it isn’t the job for everyone in terms of what she said about seeing the dark side of life i think my view of the world has changed a bit sometimes i have to actively renorm myself on the 99 of children who dont have autism or the 98 of children who dont have developmental delay or the 95 of children who have never been in the care system or the 75 of children who dont have behaviour problems and i sure know the worst examples of what children have to live through in terms of abuse neglect family dysfunction and other adversity i guess it depends what you think of as most difficult i see young people who have selfharmed and those who have terrible histories of abuse but i actually find most of them really enjoyable and inspiring to work with though on occasion i do get bad dreams full of child protectiontype situations it can be downheartening when things go badly for the people you work with like their nice foster carer gets ill and they have to change placement or their alcoholic mum starts drinking again after some signs she might be comitted to changing her lifestyle or they are raped or mugged or something and it does make you aware of many grim realities that other people can shut out of their consciousness it can also be hard when you realise you need to stop trying to work with someone and make a child protection referral because they are harmful and unableunwilling to change this even though they seem to love their child or when you need to recommend that children are removed in expert witness work it is also tough that we increasingly have to defend ourselves form complaints made by people we are trying to help however for me the most difficult aspect of the job is when organisational politics or awkward individuals block rather than facilitate your ability to work whether that is a professional who constantly snipes at your practise in their correspondance or a service that complain about lack of input but dont acept anything that you offer or a colleague that is undermining rather than supportive in meetings etc all of these are issues i would take to supervision yep six years qualified and i still make use of that hour a month in a very similar way to when i was an ap though the sessions are less frequent and the discussions cover more management and systemic issues by proportion than clinical issues nowadays however despite a very tough caseload and intense work pressures i am currently really enjoying my work and suffering delusions of competencei guess that it takes good supervision and supportive colleagues and family to absorb some of that but it can be stressful if you let it get on top of you some people do seek out personal therapy and others choose to gradually change their work over time to avoid burnout i deliberately choose how i arrange certain clients over the working week to ensure that no one day is too overwhelming emotionally and i also choose winddown activities like swimming after work once a week but mostly i rely on having a very emotionally absorbent husband and best friendi know that my explanation of what i did in my job a much sanitised version with no confidential information and much focus on resilience to a gp i met at a party once led to the host asking me to please talk about something less sensitive as i had upset another guest a trainee told me this is something weve talked about a lot in our ppd sessions on training  about how careful we have to be in talking about our work sometimes because what has become normal to us can actually be quite horrific for people outside of mh work its useful sometimes though to get that horrified reaction to remind ourselves that what we deal with is not normal and there are lots of families out there who function perfectly well and lots of children who are not harmed abused neglected etc i find it particularly weird after a tough day on placement to go and pick my daughter up from a school where the majority of kids are clearly well nurtured and loved its a kind of reality check im lucky to have several friends who do similar work to me so we have an informal peer supervision type thing going at times which helps bluecat added her experince this is what i was doing five months into my first post after finishing training firstly what my job is  i am 05 into acute paediatrics based at a childrens hospital and 05 into a multidisciplinary camhs team this week is fairly typical although it doesnt really reflect the professional development aspects  we have monthly camhs training sessions for the four local camhs teams and threemonthly camhs away days for the wider camhs network additionally threemonthly
