general discussion baking dairy eggs pastries 4do baked goods including milk and eggs need to be refridgerated if i brushed them with cream before cooking to brown them does this also mean they require refridgerationtheonlydjorkaeff mar 31 2015 1156 pmi am freaking out a little bit i have been baking for a long time but this weekend i baked my parents some hot cross buns for the liquid i used milk and eggs and butter i brushed them twice with heavy cream as well during baking to ensure they browned up and were nice and crisp do they need to be refridgerated i mean i used dairy doesnt all dairy need to be refridgerated my family are out of phone reception i am hoping i have not poisoned them reply want to stay up to date with this post sign up now ›follow log in or sign up to

amabsolutely not cooking kills any bacteria in the ingredients dairy or not and provided you dont keep the baked goods too long they wont spoil indeed some of them go stale sooner if you put them in the fridge reply 1join the conversation sign up to comment on posts and users comments sign up now ›smaki apr 1 2015 0412 pmrefrigerate usa eggs and store room temp for fresh europeantype eggs depends on where the eggs come from note for young or elderly if raw much better if buy pasteurized eggs these days especially in the usa with crowded pens and egg washing going on when conventionally raised most storebought us eggs are not legal in europe for healthy adults the coddle process of usa raw eggs to harvest only yolks for fresh mayo is better than if not  while realize when eating raw egg yolks some say they must be organic pastured eggs yes if get the wrong raw egg it can kill you is best in the us to not consume any part of conventionally raised eggs raw as theyre much more likely to be contaminated with pathogens welcome theonlydjorkaeff to chow your profile does not say your location yet or would be more specific as john said cooking probably killed any bacteria my nurse grandma said to sterilize anything takes 10 minutes heated above boiling at 212°f and 20 minutes above is best she lived to be 97 and sometimes if hungry used their sterilizer at work to hard boil eggs with hospital coworkers here is one article with more information on consuming eggs why and precautionary advise if consume raw eggs in the future a most healthy way to eat egg yolks please see belowhttparticlesmercolacomsitesart by dr mercola if youre an american you probably store eggs in the refrigerator – and wouldnt think of doing it any other way yet the us is one of the only countries where chicken eggs are kept refrigerated in much of europe for instance eggs are often stored right on the counter at room temperature but then us eggs would be illegal in europe due to an eggwashing process that may actually make them more susceptible to contamination with bacteria like salmonella in the us eggs are refrigerated to help reduce salmonella risks if an egg is infected with salmonella the bacteria will multiply more quickly if the egg is stored at room temperature instead of in the refrigerator particularly if theyre stored for longer than 21 days see source1 below this is why in the us public health agencies advise keeping your eggs in the fridge and the truth is the way most eggs are raised in the us – in industrial concentrated animal feeding operations or cafos – the risk of salmonella contamination rises in cafos egglaying hens are often crammed into tiny quarters with less space to stand upon than the computer screen you are looking at disease is rampant and the birds are filthy — not because of their nature but because we have removed them from their natural habitat and compromised their innate resistance to disease eggs from such large flocks 30000 birds or more… and some actually house millions of hens and eggs from caged hens have many times more salmonella bacteria than eggs from smaller flocks organically fed and freeranging flocks theyre also more likely to be antibioticresistant strains due to the flocks routine exposure to such drugs it is because of these diseasepromoting practices that the us also employs egg washing – a technique thats actually banned in europe why are american eggs washed when egg washing is banned in much of europe when you have eggs from tens of thousands of chickens – or more  all under one roof theres a good chance theyre going to get feces and other contaminants on them the us solution rather than reducing the size of the flocks and ensuring better sanitation and access to the outdoors is to wash the eggs but this isnt as innocuous as it sounds as the eggs are scrubbed rinsed dried and spritzed with a chlorine mist its protective cuticle may be compromised this is a natural barrier that comes from the mother hen that lays the egg and it acts as a shield against bacteria it even contains antimicrobial properties us eggwashing strips this natural protectant from the egg which may actually make it more likely to become contaminated according to european union eu guidelinessuch damage may favor transshell contamination with bacteria and moisture loss and thereby increase the risk to consumers particularly if subsequent drying and storage conditions are not optimal industrial egg washing by the way is banned in much of europe not only because of potential damage to the eggs cuticles but also because it might allow for more sloppy eggproducing practices the chief executive of britains egg industry council told forbes see source2 belowin europe the understanding is that prohibiting the washing and cleaning of eggs actually encourages good husbandry on farms its in the farmers best interests then to produce the cleanest eggs possible as no one is going to buy their eggs if theyre dirty in the us of course youd have no way of knowing whether your brightwhite grocerystore eggs were covered in filth before they arrived in your kitchen plus about 10 percent of us eggs are treated with mineral or vegetable oil basically as a way to replace the protective cuticle thats just been washed off unfortunately since an eggshell contains approximately 7500 pores or openings once the natural cuticle has been removed whats put on your egg goes into your egg meaning whatever the eggshell comes into contact with can cross over this semipermeable membrane and end up in your scrambled eggs from chlorine to mineral oil to dish soap  to salmonella the other reason why the eu recommends constant room temperature egg storage european egg marketing regulations state that storing eggs in cold storage and then leaving them out at room temperature could lead to condensation which could promote the growth of bacteria on the shell that could probably get into the egg as well as io9 reported the eu therefore advises storing eggs at a constant nonrefrigerated temperature see source3 beloweu guidelines therefore stipulate that eggs should be transported and stored at as constant a temperature as possible – a temperature between 662 °f and 698°f in the winter and between 698°f and 734°f in the summer so despite what you may have heard eggs that are fresh and have an intact cuticle do not need to be refrigerated as long as you are going to consume them within a relatively short period of time in the us refrigeration of eggs became the cultural norm when mass production caused eggs to travel long distances and sit in storage for weeks to months before arriving at your superstore the general lack of cleanliness of cafos has increased the likelihood that your eggs have come into contact with pathogens amplifying the need for disinfection and refrigeration so if your eggs are very fresh and if their cuticle is intact you do not have to refrigerate them according to hilary thesmar director of the american egg boards egg safety center see source4 belowthe bottom line is shelf life the shelf life for an unrefrigerated egg is 7 to 10 days and for refrigerated its 30 to 45 days a good rule of thumb is one day at room temperature is equal to one week under refrigeration eggs purchased from grocery stores are typically already three weeks old or older usdacertified eggs must have a pack date on the carton and a sellby date realize that the eggs were often laid many days prior to the pack date most grocerystore eggs in the us should not be left unrefrigerated because theyve had their cuticles essentially washed off if your eggs are fresh from the organic farm with intact cuticles and will be consumed within a few days you can simply leave them on the counter or in a cool cupboard are us organic eggs washed organic flocks are typically much smaller than the massive commercial flocks typically by an order or two of magnitude where bacteria flourish which is part of the reason why eggs from truly organic freerange chickens are far less likely to contain dangerous bacteria such as salmonella their nutrient content is also much higher than commercially raised eggs which is most likely the result of the differences in diet between organic free ranging pastured hens and commercially farmed hens as far as washing detergents and other chemicals used for wet cleaning organic eggs must either be nonsynthetic or among the allowed synthetics on the national list of allowed nonagricultural substances which can include chlorine ozone hydrogen peroxide vinegar and others some farmers report rinsing eggs very quickly in water just to dislodge any debris and believe this is adequate others use a dry brushing process  no liquids at all  just a brush sandpaper or a loofah sponge since most organic egg producers are typically interested in producing highquality eggs many of them—especially small local farming operations—have implemented gentle washing methods that dont compromise the cuticle however you certainly cant tell by looking at them what type of washing process they may have gone through the only way to know if your eggs have been washed or oiled and using what agents is to ask the producer  and the only way to do that is to buy from small local farmers you have direct contact with locally raised eggs are usually best the key here is to buy your eggs locally this is typically even preferable to organic eggs from the grocery store about the only time i purchase eggs from the store is when i am traveling or for some reason i miss my local egg pickup finding highquality organic eggs locally is getting easier as virtually every rural area has individuals with chickens if you live in an urban area visiting the local health food stores is typically the quickest route to finding the highquality local egg sources farmers markets and food coops are another great way to meet the people who produce your food with facetoface contact you can get your questions answered and know exactly what youre buying better yet visit the farm  ask for a tour if they have nothing to hide they should be eager to show you their operation eggs are a highly nutritious food the issue of whether or not to refrigerate your eggs becomes a moot point if youve been scared into believing that eggs are bad for your health i want to address this briefly as there is a major misconception that you must avoid foods like eggs and saturated fat to protect your heart eggs are an incredible source of highquality protein and fat—nutrients that many are deficient in and i believe eggs are a nearly ideal fuel source for most of us the evidence clearly shows that eggs are one of the most healthful foods you can eat and can actually help prevent disease including heart disease for example previous studies have found that consumption of more than six eggs per week does not increase the risk of stroke and ischemic stroke see source5 beloweating two eggs a day does not adversely affect endothelial function an aggregate measure of cardiac risk in healthy adults supporting the view that dietary cholesterol may be less detrimental to cardiovascular health than previously thought see source6 belowproteins in cooked eggs are converted by gastrointestinal enzymes producing peptides that act as ace inhibitors common prescription medications for lowering blood pressure see source7 belowa survey of south carolina adults found no correlation of blood cholesterol levels with bad dietary habits such as use of red meat animal fats fried foods butter eggs whole milk bacon sausage and cheese see source8 belowas for how to eat your eggs for optimal health ideally the yolks should be consumed raw as the heat will damage many of the highly perishable nutrients in the yolk additionally the cholesterol in the yolk can be oxidized with high temperatures especially when it is in contact with the iron present in the whites and cooked as in scrambled eggs and such oxidation contributes to chronic inflammation in your body however if youre eating raw eggs they must be organic pastured eggs you do not want to consume conventionally raised eggs raw as theyre much more likely to be contaminated with pathogens the next best option to raw is to eat them softboiled or gently cooked sunny side up with very runny yolks one final caveat i would strongly encourage you to avoid all omega3 eggs as they typically come from chickens that are fed poorquality sources of omega3 fats that are already oxidized omega3 eggs are also more likely to perish faster than nonomega3 eggs sources of information quoted on io9com november 15 20131 epidemiol infect 1991 jun106 348996 2 forbes october 25 2012 3 io9com november

baked buns are fine until they go stale or mouldy and you can tell that very easily cookies can last weeks fruitcake can last years i generally refrigerate custard based items or things with a lot of fresh fruit after the first day as theyll go off faster as an aside  eggs can stay fresh for quite a long time at room temperature  where i live they are sold unrefrigerated which in the market in the summer is quite a high temperature pasturized dairy can last a while too depending on the temperature and level of fat cooler temperatures and higher fat lasts longer milk straight from the cow in warm temperatures without a method of chilling it does start to spoil fairly quickly and would traditionally be turned into buttercheeseyoghurt etc before that point reply 1
