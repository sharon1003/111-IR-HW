on this page you will find example of marijuana plant problems and the possible solutions to help your plant to get healthy again we want to point out that most of the problems people have like yellow leaves brown spots and curly leaves are because of a deficiency of nutrients a healthy marijuana plant always start with a good balanced nutrient supply we recommend the following fertilizer kit from advanced nutrients and if you haven’t download this free growing book because it will help you with many growing problems ok let’s go on to see what’s wrong with your plantsheat stresslook closely and you’ll see the brown leaf edges that are indicative of heat stress this damage looks alot like nutrient burn except it occurs only at the tops of the plants closest to the lamps there’s only one cure for this…get the heat away from the plants either by moving the lamps or moving the plants figure 1nutrient burnthere’s a good chance that this bud was subjected to nutrient solution burn these symptoms are seen when the ec concentration of hydroponic solutions is too high these symptoms also appear when strong nutrient solution is splashed onto the leaves under hot hid lamps causing the leaves to burn under the solution figure 2many hydroponic gardeners see this problem it’s the beginning of nutriet burn it indicates that the plants have all the nutrients they can possibly use and there’s a slight excess back off the concentration of the nutrient solution just a touch and the problem should disappear note that if the plants never get any worse than this here then the plants are probably just fine figure 3over fertilisingfigure 4 is definitely an over fertiliser problem the high level of nutrients accumulates in the leaves and causes them to dry out and burn up as shown here you must flush with clear clean water immediately to allow the roots to recover and prevent further damage the find the cause of the high nutrient levels figure 4over wateringthe plants in figure 5 were on a continuous drip system where nutrient solution is constantly being pumped into the medium this tends to keep the entire root system completely saturated a better way would be to periodically feed the plants say for 12 hour every 23 hours this would give the roots a chance to get needed air to them and prevent root rot and other problems don’t be throw off by the fact that the plants in figure 5 are sitting in still water this is actually an h2o2 solution used to try and correct the problem adding an airstone to the tub would also help add o2 to the solution figure 5ph problemboth of these leaves in figure 6 and figure 7 are from the same plant it could be over fertilisation but more likely it is due to the p h being off too high or too low a p h can lock up nutrients in the form of undisolvable salts and compounds some of which are actually toxic to the plants what then happens is the grower then tries to supplement the plants diet by adding more fertilisers throwing off the p h even more and locking up even more nutrients this type of problem is seen more often in soil mixes where inconsistent mixing of the medium’s components leads to “hot” spots there are products on the market to increase or decrease your ph level also a ph meter would be handy to control your ph levels all the time figure 6figure 7ozone damageozone damage typically found near the generator although a rare problem symptoms generally appear as a mg deficiency but the symptoms are localised to immediately around the generator figure 8 figure 8deficiencyroot stunting is characteristic of calcium deficiency acidity aluminium toxicity and copper toxicity some species may also show it when boron deficient the shortened roots become thickened the laterals become stubby peglike and the whole system often discolours brown or grey new shoots unopened young leaves distorted dead leaf tips pale green plant copper deficiency new shoots withered or dead petiole or stem collapse shoots stunted green plant calcium deficiency young leaves pale green or yellow rosetting or dead tip dieback dark green plant boron deficiency mobile elements are more likely to exhibit visual deficiencies in the older leaves because during demand these elements will be exported to the new growth nitrate – ammonium is found in both inorganic and organic forms in the plant and combines with carbon hydrogen oxygen and sometimes sulphur to form amino acids amino enzymes nucleic acids chlorophyll alkaloids and purine bases nitrogen rates high as molecular weight proteins in plant tissue plants need lots of n during vegging but it’s easy to overdo it added too much flush the soil with plain water soluble nitrogen especially nitrate is the form that’s the most quickly available to the roots while insoluble n like urea first needs to be broken down by microbes in the soil before the roots can absorb it avoid excessive ammonium nitrogen which can interfere with other nutrients too much n delays flowering plants should be allowed to become ndeficient late in flowering for best flavor nitrogen deficiencies plants will exhibit lack of vigor slow growth and will be weak and stunted quality and yield will be significantly reduced older leaves become yellow chlorotic from lack of chlorophyll deficient plants will exhibit uniform light green to yellow on older leaves these leaves may die and drop leaf margins will not curled up noticeably chlorosis will eventually spread throughout the plant stems petioles and lower leaf surfaces may turn purple figure 9as seen in figure 10 consumption of nitrogen n from the fan leaves during the final phase of flowing is 100 normal figure 10leaves are often dark green and in the early stages abundant with foliage if excess is severe leaves will dry and begin to fall off root system will remain under developed or deteriorate after time fruit and flower set will be inhibited or deformed with breakdown of vascular tissue restricting water uptake stress resistance is drastically diminished phosphorus is a component of certain enzymes and proteins adenosine triphosphate atp ribonucleic acids rna deoxyribonucleic acids dna and phytin atp is involved in various energy transfer reactions and rna and dna are components of genetic information figure 11 is severe phosphorus p deficiency during flowering fan leaves are dark green or redpurple and may turn yellow leaves may curl under go brown and die smallformed buds are another main symptom phosphorus deficiencies exhibit slow growing weak and stunted plants with dark green or purple pigmentation in older leaves and stems some deficiency during flowering is normal but too much shouldn’t be tolerated red petioles and stems are a normal genetic characteristic for many varieties plus it can also be a cosymptom of n k and mgdeficiencies so red stems are not a foolproof sign of pdeficiency too much p can lead to iron deficiency purpling accumulation of anthocyanin pigments causes an overall dark green color with a purple red or blue tint and is the common sign of phosphate deficiency some plant species and varieties respond to phosphate deficiency by yellowing instead of purpling purpling is natural to some healthy ornamentals figure 11figure 12 shows phosphorus p deficiency during vegatative growth many people mistaken this for a fungus but look for the damage to occur near the end of leave and leaves the color dull greyish with a very brittle texture figure 12this condition is rare and usually buffered by p h limitations excess phosphorus can interfere with the availability and stability of copper and zinc potassium is involved in maintaining the water status of the plant and the tugor pressure of it’s cells and the opening and closing of the stomata potassium is required in the accumulation and translocation of carbohydrates lack of potassium will reduce yield and quality older leaves are initially chlorotic but soon develop dark necrotic lesions dead tissue first apparent on the tips and margins of the leaves stem and branches may become weak and easily broken the plant may also stretch the plant will become susceptible to disease and toxicity in addition to appearing to look like iron deficiency the tips of the leaves curl and the edges burn and die potassium – too much sodium na displaces k causing a k deficiency sources of high salinity are baking soda sodium bicarbonate “p hup” too much manure and the use of watersoftening filters which should not be used if the problem is na flush the soil k can get locked up from too much ca or ammonium nitrogen and possibly cold weather figure 13figure 14usually not absorbed excessively by plants excess potassium can aggravate the uptake of magnesium manganese zinc and iron and effect the availability of calcium magnesium is a component of the chlorophyll molecule and serves as a cofactor in most enzymes magnesium deficiency will exhibit a yellowing which may turn brown and interveinal chlorosis beginning in the older leaves the older leaves will be the first to develop interveinal chlorosis starting at leaf margin or tip and progressing inward between the veins notice how the veins remain somewhat green though as can be seen in figure 15 notice how in figure 16 and 17 the leaves curl upwards like they’re praying they’re praying for mg the tips may also twist this can be quickly resolved by watering with 1 tablespoon epsom saltsgallon of water until you can correct nutrient lockout try foliar feeding that way the plants get all the nitrogen and mg they need the plants can be foliar feed at ½ teaspoonquart of epsom salts first powdered and dissolved in some hot water when mixing up soil use 2 teaspoon dolomite lime per gallon of soil if the starting water is above 200 ppm that is pretty hard water that will lock out mg with all of the calcium in the water either add a 14 teaspoon per gallon of epsom salts or lime both will effectively reduce the lockout or invest into a reverse osmosis water filter mg can get lockedup by too much ca cl or ammonium nitrogen don’t overdo mg or you’ll lock up other nutrients figure 15figure 16figure 17magnesium toxicity is rare and not generally exhibited visibly extreme high levels will antagonise other ions in the nutrient solution zinc plays a roll in the same enzyme functions as manganese and magnesium more than eighty enzymes contain tightly bound zinc essential for their function zinc participates in chlorophyll formation and helps prevent chlorophyll destruction carbonic anhydrite has been found to be specifically activated by zinc deficiencies appear as chlorosis in the interveinal areas of new leaves producing a banding appearance as seen in figure 18 this may be accompany reduction of leaf size and a shortening between internodes leaf margins are often distorted or wrinkled branch terminals of fruit will die back in severe cases also gets locked out due to high p h zn fe and mn deficiencies often occur together and are usually from a high p h don’t overdo the micronutrients lower the p h if that’s the problem so the nutrients become available foliar feed if the plant looks real bad use chelated zinc zinc deficiency produces “little leaf” in many species especially woody ones the younger leaves are distinctly smaller than normal zinc deficiency may also produce “rosetting” the stem fails to elongate behind the growing tip so that the terminal leaves become tightly bunched figure 18excess zinc is extremely toxic and will cause rapid death excess zinc interferes with iron causing chlorosis from iron deficiency excess will cause sensitive plants to become chlorotic immobile elements will show their first symptoms on younger leaves and progress to the whole plant sulphate is involved in protein synthesis and is part of the amino acids cystine and thiamine which are the building blocks of proteins it is active in the structure and metabolism in the plant it is essential for respiration and the synthesis and breakdown of fatty acids the initial symptoms are the yellowing of the entire leaf including veins usually starting with the younger leaves leaf tips may yellow and curl downward sulphur deficiencies are light green fruit or younger leaves with a lack of succulence elongated roots and woody stem although it’s hard to see in figure 19 the upper stems of this plant are purple although many varieties of cannabis do get purplish stems the trait generally extends the entire length of the plant’s stem and not just near the top as in this specimen figure 19leaf size will be reduced and overall growth will be stunted leaves yellowing or scorched at edges excess may cause early senescence calcium plays an important role in maintaining cell integrity and membrane permeability young leaves are affected first and become small and distorted or chlorotic with irregular margins spotting or necrotic areas bud development is inhibited blossom end rot and internal decay may also occur and root may be under developed or die back deficiency will cause root tip dieback leaf tip curl and marginal necrosis and chlorosis primarily in younger leaves symptoms young leaves develop chlorosis and distortion such as crinkling dwarfing developing a straplike shape shoots stop growing and thicken difficult to distinguish visually may precipitate with sulphur in solution and cause clouding or residue in tank excess calcium may produce deficiencies in magnesium and potassium iron is an important component of plant enzyme systems for electron transport to carry electrons during photosynthesis and terminal respiration it is a catalyst for chlorophyll production and is required for nitrate and sulphate reduction and assimilation pronounced inter veinal chlorosis similar to that caused by magnesium deficiency but on the younger leaves leaves exhibit chlorosis yellowing of the leaves mainly between the veins starting with the lower and middle leaves caused by factors that interfere with iron absorption of roots over irrigation excessive soluble salts inadequate drainage pests high substrate p h or nematodes this is easily corrected by adding an iron supplement with the next watering fe is unavailable to plants when the p h of the water or soil is too high if deficient lower the p h to about 65 for rockwool about 57 and check that you’re not adding too much p which can lock up fe use iron that’s chelated for maximum availability read your fertilizer’s ingredients – chelated iron might read something like “iron edta” to much fe without adding enough p can cause a pdeficiency note that when adding iron to the solution it is often necessary to not use fertilizer for that watering iron has a tendency of reacting with many of the components of fertilizer solutions and will cause nutrient lockup to occur read the labels of both the iron supplement and the fertiliser you are using before you attempt to combine the two figure 20excess accumulation is rare but could cause bronzing or tiny brown spots on leaf surface manganese is involved in the oxidation reduction process in the photosynthetic electron transport system biochemical research shows that this element plays a structural role in the chloroplast membrane system and also activates numerous enzymes inter veinal chlorosis of younger leaves necrotic lesions and leaf shredding are typical symptom of this deficiency high levels can cause uneven distribution of chlorophyll resulting in blotchy appearance restricted growth and failure to mature normally can also result mn gets locked out when the p h is too high and when there’s too much iron use chelated mn toxicity chlorosis or blotchy leaf tissue due to insufficient chlorophyll synthesis growth rate will slow and vigour will decline chloride is involved in the evolution of oxygen in the photosynthesis process and is essential for cell division in roots and leaves chlorine raises the cell osmotic pressure and affects stomata regulation and increases the hydration of plant tissue levels less than 140 ppm are safe for most plants chloride sensitive plants may experience tip or marginal leaf burn at concentrations above 20 ppm wilted chlorotic leaves become bronze in colour roots become stunted and thickened near tips plants with chlorine deficiencies will be pale and suffer wilting burning of leaf tip or margins bronzing yellowing and leaf splitting reduced leaf size and lower growth rate boron biochemical functions are yet uncertain but evidence suggests it is involved in the synthesis of one of the bases for nucleic acid rna uracil formation it may also be involved in some cellular activities such as division differentiation maturation and respiration it is associated with pollen germination plants deficient in boron exhibit brittle abnormal growth at shoot tips and one of the earliest symptoms is failure of root tips to elongate normally stem and root apical meristems often die root tips often become swollen and discoloured internal tissues may rot and become host to fungal disease leaves show various symptoms which include drying thickening distorting wilting and chlorotic or necrotic spotting yellowing of leaf tip followed by necrosis of the leaves beginning at tips or margins and progressing inward before leaves die and prematurely fall off some plants are especially sensitive to boron accumulation copper is a constituent of many enzymes and proteins assists in carbohydrate metabolism nitrogen fixation and in the process of oxygen reduction symptoms of deficiency are a reduced or stunted growth with a distortion of the younger leaves and growth tip dieback young leaves often become dark green and twisted they may die back or just exhibit necrotic spots growth and yield will be deficient as well copper is required in very small amounts and readily becomes toxic in solution culture if not carefully controlled excess values will induce iron deficiency root growth will be suppressed followed by symptoms of iron chlorosis stunting reduced branching abnormal darkening and thickening of roots molybdenum is a component of two major enzyme systems involved in the nitrate reeducates this is the process of conversion of nitrate to ammonium often inter veinal chlorosis which occurs first on older leaves then progressing to the entire plant developing severely twisted younger leaves which eventually die molybdenum deficiencies frequently resemble nitrogen with older leaves chlorotic with rolled margins and stunted growth excess may cause discolouration of leaves depending on plant species this condition is rare but could occur from accumulation by continuous application used by the plant in very small quantities excess mostly usually does not effect the plant however the consumption of high levels by grazing animals can pose problems so she might not be too good to smoke sodium seems to encourage crop yields and in specific cases it acts as an anti doting agent against various toxic salts it may act as a partial substitute for potassium deficiencies excess may cause plant toxicity or induce deficiencies of other elements if sodium predominates in the solution calcium and magnesium may be affected silicon usually exists in solution as silicic acid and is absorbed in this form it accumulates as hydrated amorphous silica most abundantly in walls of epidermal cells but also in primary and secondary walls of other cells it is largely available in soils and is found in water as well inadequate amounts of silicon can reduce tomato yields as much as 50 cause new leaves to be deformed and inhibit fruit set at this time toxicity symptoms are undetermined cobalt is essential to many beneficial bacteria that are involved in nitrogen fixation of legumes it is a component of vitamin b12 which is essential to most animals and possibly in plants reports suggest that it may be involved with enzymes needed to form aromatic compounds otherwise it is not understood fully as to its benefit to plant growth but it is considered essential to some animal
