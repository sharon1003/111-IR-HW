science  mathematics zoology what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow african and european follow 9 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer there are 47 species of swallow native to africa of those only two are actually named for the continent the west african swallow hirundo domicella and the south african swallow hirundo spilodera the south african swallows range only extends as far north as zaire and thus it is probably the nonmigratory bird often mentioned in these comparisons the european swallow hirundo rustica must beat its wings 18 times per second to remain airborne not 43 as is popularly believed comparing this with the average amplitude of their wing beat we come out to an average airspeed of about 11 meters per second approximately 24 miles an hour this is cruising speed mind you its possible that the birds could as much as double that for top speed the south african swallow is slightly more massive than the european swallow however its wing is also correspondigly larger although biometric data on the species is hard to come across and not easily electronically accessible it is reasonable to assume that this species has much the same unladen air velocity as the european species that is about 11 meters per second source shttpwwwstyleorgunladenswallowhaysoos2 · 1 decade ago4 0 comment askers rating arthur the swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter yet these are not strangers to our land soldier 1 are you suggesting coconuts migrate arthur not at all they could be carried soldier 1 what a swallow carrying a coconut arthur it could grip it by the husk soldier 1 its not a question of where he grips it its a simple question of weight ratios a five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut arthur well it doesnt matter will you go and tell your master that arthur from the court of camelot is here soldier 1 listen in order to maintain airspeed velocity a swallow needs to beat its wings fortythree times every second right arthur please soldier 1 am i right arthur im not interested soldier 2 it could be carried by an african swallow soldier 1 oh yeah an african swallow maybe but not a european swallow thats my point soldier 2 oh yeah i agree with that arthur will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at camelot soldier 1 but then of course a african swallows are nonmigratory soldier 2 oh yeah soldier 1 so they couldnt bring a coconut back anyway soldier 2 wait a minute supposing two swallows carried it together soldier 1 no theyd have to have it on a line soldier 2 well simple theyd just use a strand of creeper soldier 1 what held under the dorsal guiding feathers soldier 2 well why not thufir · 1 decade ago1 0 comment african or european source s mp fanhehe3301 · 1 decade ago1 0 comment fast enough to carry half a coconut nat man · 1 decade ago0 0 comment well it depends on if they are carrying a coconut with stringcosaxteacher · 1 decade ago0 0 comment are they carrying coconuts govinda505 · 1 decade ago1 0 comment me brain hurtsbigbob2 · 1 decade ago0 0 comment im not interested source s monte python deepthinker · 1 decade ago0 0 comment i dont know aahhhhhhhhhhhhiliketodoit · 1 decade ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these consolidate your student loans need a dui attorney try for your mba online masters of marketing online
