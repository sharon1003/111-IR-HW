new rules for dependent children soon to take force july 2 2014 by cic news as a result of recent regulatory amendments starting 1 august 2014 the canadian government will redefine who can immigrate to canada as a ‘dependent child’ from that date onward the definition of dependent children will be narrowed to individuals 19 years of age or younger currently the age cutoff for dependent children is 21 years of age this change has major ramifications for individuals applying for canadian immigration with their families who is a dependent child in the context of canadian immigration law a dependant child is not only the biological or adopted offspring of an applicant but must also meet certain criteria previously children could be considered dependant if they were either under the age of 22 and not married or in a commonlaw relationshipreliant on the financial support of their parent s before turning 22 and unable to support themselves due to a mental or physical condition or reliant on the financial support of their parent s and studying as a fulltime student since before 22 or since becoming a spouse or commonlaw partner what’s changed with the new definition of “dependant child” coming into force the government of canada will now reduce the age of dependency to 19 this means that after august 1 in order to be considered a dependent child for the purposes of immigration an individual must be under 19 years of age and be neither married nor in a commonlaw relationship it is important to note that children over 19 will no longer be considered dependents if they are participating in fulltime studies however children who are 19 years and older and unable to support themselves because they suffer from a mental or physical condition can still be considered dependant the processing fee for all dependant children will now be 150 government rationale economic stability is a major area of concern for canada as a result the immigration and refugee protection act is designed to maximize the benefits of immigration on the canadian economy attracting immigrants that have the greatest chances of achieving economic success in the labour force is thus a central goal the government of canada claims that after extensive research it has found that younger dependent children between ages 15 and 18 achieve more economic success and adapt more easily to the canadian labour market than those that are older between 19 and 21 dependent children account for a full onethird of immigrants admitted to canada each year such high numbers contribute in part to citizenship and immigration canada’s uphill battle in keeping immigration processing times as low as possible the department reasons that the upcoming changes will reduce processing times for visa officers who currently work long hours certifying claims of fulltime school enrollment for older dependent children fraudulent school attendance records are also common sources of problems that delay processing the changes take school enrollment out of the equation altogether thus simplifying the process for both applicants and visa officers applying for immigration with dependent children the changing definition of “dependent child” has significant consequences for prospective immigrants to canada if one or more of their children are no longer considered a dependent child and cannot accompany them many potential immigrants may choose not to come to canada however the regulations do not go into effect until august 1 so there is still time to benefit from the current rules individuals hoping to immigrate with children over the age of 19 must apply before this date in order to ensure that their children will be considered for immigration to canada it is important to note that this change will not be applied retroactively to applications submitted before august“one of the greatest benefits of becoming a canadian permanent resident is that not only do you get this coveted status but so do your dependents” said attorney david cohen “in just a few short weeks many families will learn that their young adult children are no longer able to join them on their canadian journey they will have to act fast to either submit their applications before the rules go into play or to explore other options for their loved ones to immigrate”it is important to note that there are over 60 canadian immigration programs and that children who are no longer classified as dependent may be eligible to immigrate through a different program in addition they may be eligible to come to canada as international students or temporary foreign workers however for many families the most straightforward option is to include any and all eligible individuals on a single immigration application to find out if you are eligible to immigrate through one of over 60 canadian immigration programs contact campbell cohen today
