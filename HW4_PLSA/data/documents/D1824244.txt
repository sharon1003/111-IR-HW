ronald kelly says february 12 2018 at 257 pm pros netflix price if you buy on deal bbc iplayer fast torrenting lots servers cybersec feature browser extensions cons doesn’t show location of servers cities onion over vpn very slow basically it is a vpn for everyday users good for streaming not recommended if you want to do something fishy…reply paul adler says february 2 2018 at 303 pm wow the comments here are really merciless my experience however has been positive so either these people here are shills or extremely unlucky furthermore web rtc leaks most likely mean you have some malware downloaded and has nothing to do with quality of service… if you are already compromised before connecting to a server how in the world you could become secure after connecting reply mario says november 20 2017 at 618 pm nord vpn’s connection used to break quite often now it’s getting better and this does not depend on the “pcability” of the user i’ve also experienced blackouts lasting even days and c’mon their windows client sucks looks like the work of a child their linux “client” is nothing else than openvpn that you must install configure and run by yourself but this being the work of someone else at least works reply bridgewo says august 23 2017 at 231 pm friendly customer care department and big advantage they have live chat available 247 because some main players have just tickets system and you have to wait for hours for a reply and then again and again tons of time for each reply speeds are just perfect near isp of course it depends on how far away the nearest server but from over 1100 you could find the best for you and it’s quite the only one which still works with us netflix reply tony says august 21 2017 at 408 pm between march and may this service was very good june rolled around and something changed the servers would just kill the data stream while remaining connected sometimes it would take hours other times minutes some days the service is unusable as the loss of data stream would be so frequent nothing was usable i have a ticket with nord over 120 entries long all i get is continuous change of techs who do not read the thread and request what has already been done the replies from tech are now averaging over a week between friends and family whom i recommended nord to 9 in all we are all experiencing the same problem this ranges from toronto hamilton niagara ontario oregon arizona florida and west virginia and all but one have open tickets nord says i’m the only one with this problem really even when i send them the ticket numbers of the others they insist i’m the only one i got a 3 day trial with hma 2 weeks ago and did not have a single loss of the data stream same with ipvanish last week so the problem is with nord afaic nord does not the will or expertise to fix this and last week refused to refund the unused part of the 2 years i paid for they have no phone number and refuse to call so you are stuck with chats which lead to a waste of time and their ticket system which they reply to when someone else in their tech team decides to reply 11 to date i have access to 3 different isp services and public wifi the data stream dies on all and on all my devices pc ipad iphone android phone android box and xbox i have been with 7 different vpn providers over the years this one has to be the worst so far i chose nord because they are away from the 14 eyes and the 1 month i took before signing up for 2 years was flawless replypresicl says november 16 2016 at 1056 am the correct coupon for 70 discount is  70offyear replystupidcache says august 21 2016 at 1233 pm you forgot to tell to the people that nordvpn is not useful for watching netxflix in linux almost you sacrifice a lot performance using a stupid vm smart play not available in linux is secure proxy service that helps to overcome geographical restrictions put on by several websites smart play reroutes the user’s requests through a server located at a place where access to such blocked websites is allowed this makes the websites think the user is physically present in such place thereby granting it the access reply leek says june 17 2016 at 128 pm i am active nord vpn user and also their beta tester so i can say that those guys know what they are doing nord is really safe also they put huge effort on netflix i’ve tested several vpns when was trying to access usa netflix many of them say the work with netflix but in reality only nord showed good result reply p p says june 16 2016 at 1020 am tor hides all your internet traffic by wrapping your connection into 3 different layers it’s like an onion where these layers are stripped as they pass through each node the only node where your browser activity is known is at the exit node by adding a vpn to the framework and using tor you can hide your traffic from being read by anyone with a tor  vpn you hide the traffic at the exit node as well making it impossible almost for anyone to see what you are up to replykurt c says june 16 2016 at 1019 am well if you are worried that your vpn will read your internet traffic then you should change your vpn that’s why there is a big deal about whether the vpn keeps logs or not the payment method it offers bitcoin instead of credit card so that no records can be linked back to you running a tor locally through your vpn is some issues for starters you will be running the basic ssl connection with all its disadvantages and passing of keys in addition to that your entry point will be known as you will be running everything through the vpn and all your internet traffic from the laptop pc smartphone and whatever will be passing through a single place the vpn server so it really doesn’t matter if you use a tor or a vpn your isp will know that you are trying to hide your ip address and internet activities on the other hand using a double vpn makes much more sense well if you don’t trust your vpn or the entry point of tor then using a double vpn can provide you some security but tor doesn’t hide your traffic beyond the basic ssl and since your internet traffic is passing through multiple vpn servers you are just creating a lot of latency for yourself a better way protecting your traffic from being read by your vpn is connecting to your destination with ssl through the vpn replyosborn says june 16 2016 at 1018 am as much as i love nord you shouldn’t really be using their tor vpn it’s better to use their double vpn along with tor instead of just using tor vpn what tor does is that it decrypts your vpn traffic and then encrypts it again before sending it over tor network using a double vpn means you add more security and 2 hops before it reaches tor reply normie says june 16 2016 at 1017 am i think their tor vpn is really useful and i have been using it for a while however the lack of information and documentations available for servers is a bit irritating i mean it would be good that the pushed routes are a bit more concerned about the ip address of the destination server instead of assuming that you want all your traffic to be pushed through 00001 route and then to the outside replyjjones says june 16 2016 at 1017 am i have been using nord vpn on linux and i am very happy with their service they now offer vpn clients for android and i os devices as well but previously they only offered it on windows but won’t have any problems in using nord vpn on any device by using the ovpn configuration file i am using their service on linux and really like it how they offer ca and tls certificates for download separately along with ovpn files this makes it easier for me to configure the service with linux network manager however one problem that i faced was that the zip file didn’t contain some of the servers they offered if they can fix this then nord vpn is a top notch service their customer support is also very good and the encryption levels are also decent they offer aes 256 encryption and rsa 4096 bit for key exchange which is pretty good considering it’s the strongest encryption out there if i am not wrong they only offer tcp 443 and udp 1194 ports but it also offers lzo compression which is a good sign i only wish they also provided lower encryption keys for mobile devices so that the battery doesn’t run out quickly the speeds are also decent but very inconsistent at times not all servers are quick at all times as some are fast but others are slow although they offer wide selection of servers i really don’t think their servers are top notch their performance can be seen during the holiday season as during christmas there was immense load on servers and i got very slow speeds however it really depends on your connection as well if you have a fast connection then it should not matter but if your internet connection isn’t lightening fast then you can face bottlenecks nord vpn is pretty big on preserving its users privacy as they claim to keep no logs of your internet activities this is a good sign and also that the company is based in panama making it free any kind of foreign jurisdiction also they accept bitcoin as payment which good for privacy you can pay for their anonymously one important note nord vpn offers its own tor over vpn service although having a double vpn does beef up your security but i wouldn’t advice to use the tor vpn offered by nord this is because your internet traffic will be decrypted before sending it over tor so it kinds of defeats the purpose of having double security replyfnsm says june 16 2016 at 1016 am nord vpn ticks all the right boxes of being the best vpn i am very happy with their service and would recommend it to anyone who is new to using a vpn reply manwithoutfear says june 16 2016 at 1016 am i recently bought nord vpn a week ago and the speeds are awesome previously i used pia private internet access for more than a year but there were many problems with it and i really didn’t like their user interface it was ugly to say the least i selected nord vpn because it’s cheaper than pia and it offers great servers options i can connect to any location of my choice and access different streaming services like if you want to watch netflix usa there are servers available for that and you can enjoy your favorite shows and movies in high quality the security and anonymity provided by nord vpn is also pretty good the protocols allow me to switch between high security to high performance streaming you can check out nord vpn using their 3 day free trial by contacting their customer support if i remember correctly i signed up for their service but didn’t pay yet i then wrote an email to their customer support and they activated my 3 day free trial reply yana says

dont know how they can be most recommended logless vpn for god sick – they leak your ipv6 – no switch kill for internet connection — but worst of all they leak your real ip— if you using windows 7 like me you are fuck up i was surfing all day and i normally do not turn off my pc but only switch it to sleep mode and even i set automatic reconnect and every time i turn my pc into sleep mode and then woke up my pc their official application showed me that i am “connected” with green status but in real i was not connected and all of time i was surfing under my real address replyadmin says february 1 2016 at 103 pm sad to hear thatwe recommend you to email them if you have any issues kind regards vpnrankscom replythe npv says april 21 2016 at 118 pm as a comment below mentioned you’re likely leaking web rtc requests which is caused by the browser not by nord vpn signed up with a 70 discount and was super easy the app is excellent and the speed is perfect anyone reading this research some more yourself nord is solid reply charlie marks says october 9 2015 at 1233 pm i currently have nordvpn installed although it is clearly stating that it is connected to russia isp 21318356210 it is is fact connecting to us 4555199109 new york discvovered this when amazon uk stated that it could not deliver to us checked ‘what is my ip address’ and yes it confirms new youk very bad this bewarereplyadmin says october 16 2015 at 627 am hello charliethank you for your feedback it is quite unfortunate that you face such issues with nord vpn why don’t you try emailing them kind regards vpnrankscom reply tech advisor says september 19 2015 at 246 am nord is very unstable and slow it is not unusual to have to reconnect 10 times a day and has hour long blackout periods the worst part is to get a new connection you often have to bounce from one location to another which is the antithesis of why we want vpn they also are crooks who do not honor their word and give a refund stay away there are much better service for close to the same price  reply henry says january 9 2015 at 1004 pm nord vpn claim to be offering 70 on their registration form they enter the code “70off” automatically i tried to register for what appears to be a great offer after clicking register it simply says “error coupon code “70off” is not valid use a valid coupon only” its their own code they inserted i then had to suffer what they claim to be “customer service” having a futile discussion with this imbesile with a purile attitude and contradictory statements molly joined the chat

their own decision reply joseph kerr says february 18 2016 at 321 am you sound like a real douche nord vpn is actually really stable and very easy to setup if you’re leaking your real ip then take two seconds to actually read up why and how to fix it it has nothing to do with nord vpn your system is most likely leaking web rtc requests which you’d know you have to fix if you’d taken two seconds to research reply jersey says july 31 2016 at 212 am i’ve used nord vpn for 8 months and have no issues the problems you’ve describe all sound like you have no idea how to use a pc they are not nord vpn issues you should simply stop using pcs since they’re obviously too hard for you to grasp use a public library from now on or ask someone to teach you pc basics reply pingback maillot france pas cher
