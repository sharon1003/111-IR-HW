entertainment6 june 2004  by bobafett1138 – see all my reviews martin campbell sure knows how to make entertaining movies after making no escape and golden eye he brings us yet another entertaining movie the mask of zorro he actually used to be one of my favorite directors after seeing those movies i just named but unfortunately he hasnt made anything good lately lets hope this change after completing zorro 2 that is currently being made the mask of zorro is just some good old fashioned fun with lots of spectacular moments good choreographed fight sequences a love story and a good old fashioned stereotype villain the story is told in a good way which i think is mainly thanks to campbells directing the pace is high and the combination between the action the characters and their relations romance and some of the comical moments is done very well unlike some other movies from the same genre there is some nice cinematography that help to create a good atmosphere along with the musical score from james horner the end fight is good and it has a spectacular big explosion in it thatll make you go wow great entertainment for the whole family 810 httpbobafett1138blogspotcom32 of
