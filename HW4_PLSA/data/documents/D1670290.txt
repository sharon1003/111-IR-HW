the staggering was all wrong and the flailing unacceptable bryan cranston turned from the video playback with a grin a few weeks before he had shot the last episode of “breaking bad” the amc series that gave him what he calls “the role that will undoubtedly be the first line of my obituary” now he was on the set of “godzilla” a warner bros remake in this scene cranston playing the top scientist at a tokyo nuclear facility was having an intense argument that’s interrupted by a seismic jolt behind him jumpsuitwearing extras had begun reeling about as if they were in a cheaply enjoyable fifties version of the story rather than in the expensively enjoyable version that warner bros hoped to produce “doesn’t work does it” he said the director gareth edwards an englishman working on his first studio film gave a rueful nod “what i tell the background guys when i direct” cranston said afterward referring to the television episodes he’s directed “is ‘don’t do it think it’ if you just think this guy’s a douche bag it will come through your eyes”on this june morning all the elements were in place for a proforma blockbuster a ninefigure budget the most awesome mutant lizard that computers could generate and a colossal monument to hubris soon to lie in ruins—the nuclear facility played by the sludgecontrol building of a wastewatertreatment plant near vancouver the afternoon’s filming would consist of cameracar shots of swarms of extras racing down an endless concrete corridor and cranston barking into a walkietalkie as he raced the other way the hollywood disaster film in sum yet one reason that the filmmakers cast cranston a threetime emmy winner on “breaking bad” was to distinguish this “godzilla” from a standard remake sue kroll the president of worldwide marketing for warner bros says “when nonfanboys see that bryan is in it they’ll hesitate and think that’s interesting—i wonder what he saw in the role” the actor has become the studios’ ancho chili the ingredient that adds distinction to any dish when ben affleck was preparing “argo” in 2011 he told his producer grant heslov that he wanted to hire cranston “yeah we should” heslov replied “we’re the only movie coming out next year that doesn’t have him in it”cranston serves projects as a oneman truth squad it begins with his appearance age has favored him with the craggy slabjawed countenance of a religious elder he smiles a lot—at fiftyseven he has responded to his late stardom with boyish ardor—but when he smiles “you’re completely confused” his wife robin dearden says “because the smile doesn’t go with that face”on “godzilla” cranston radiated vigilance in one scene his character joe brody walks briskly with an administrator named stan as the two scan a printout of seismic activity stan wonders whether it shows earthquakes but brody says “no no—earthquakes are random and jagged this is steady and increasing” between takes cranston tweaked the dichotomy to “random jagged” and “consistent increasing” to give it a scientist’s concision and to avoid the paradox of “steady and increasing” he persuaded edwards to shoot the moment not as a walkandtalk and a closeup but in one go “it’s an affirmation of what joe already knows” he pointed out—no spoilers but the movie is called “godzilla”—“so he wants to move ” then he surveyed the extras and murmured “there’s a guy reading a manual in the background—would that happen” noticing that edwards was beginning to resemble st sebastian cranston patted his shoulder and said “never mind never mind—i’m picky we’re good”cranston has time for such troubleshooting because he’s not one of those broody actors who wrap themselves in a navajo blanket and insist on being addressed only as mr wolverine he gets into character instantly and can produce wracking sobs on cue the secret he learned from a stint in soap operas is to hydrate days in advance nicolas winding refn who directed cranston as a seedy mechanic in “drive” says “bryan cranston can play anything anytime anywhere any way”on “action” as the next scene began cranston instantly became a preoccupied joe brody resisting stan’s attempts to stifle his concerns and keep the plant operating but when cranston was supposed to bark “i have operational authority” it came out as “i have control authority” without skipping a beat he continued “i am the secret santa to all these guys” and everyone cracked up cranston—a master of the blowntake button and the vibrator hidden in a costar’s drawer—uses anarchy strategically to keep his sets relaxed the first time he directed an episode of “breaking bad” he arrived wearing a beret and a monocle and carrying a horsewhip between takes now he played the bongos on the crew’s hard hats duckwalked dipped into a british chav accent and recited samuel l jackson’s “motherfuckin’ snakes on this motherfuckin’ plane” speech getting jackson’s indignant cadences just right meanwhile take by take joe brody shrugged stan off more and more touchily cranston had suggested that stan drag joe aside “in order to stop me at this point he’s got to physically stop me” he explained “and my reaction—that i wouldn’t feel right about letting him move me like i was a little boy—helps create a history and a mood” edwards told me “there’s a fine line between a great characterdriven movie and a throwaway popcorn flick and that little scene is one of my favorites because it helps us harken back to a seventiesmovie feel the layer of history bryan created—that joe and stan are good friends but their friendship is being severely tested—wasn’t at all on the page” he laughed “the problem with bryan is that he comes with a lot of ideas and you have to say ‘damn it’ and rethink everything because he’s always right”if you’re always right you may not always be in the right place in his trailer cranston told me that when he trumpeted a few recent offers to his wife the skeptical tilt of her head made him realize that he’d been indiscriminate he wanted to carve out time to pursue a deal he’d made with sony television to produce his own shows and also wanted to pick roles that forced him to stretch “you never want to repeat yourself” he told me “otherwise it’s just”—he named a wellknown actor—“doing his thing” he leaped to his feet raised an imaginary pistol and shouted “get down bam bam bam bam bam ” followed by “because right now you’re safest with me” and “he’s my son” he shrugged “you can write the dialogue before you see the film”so he’d constructed a grid in blue ballpoint the cranston project assessment scale on the left were rankings from very good to poor and across the top in decreasing order of importance were story script role director and cast a very good story was worth ten points a very good cast only two story and script count the most he said because “an actor can only raise the level of bad writing by a grade c writing and i don’t care if you’re meryl streep—you can only raise it to a b” after factoring in bonus points high salary  1 significant time away from family  –3 he’d pass on a project that scored less than 16 points consider one from 16 to 20 accept one from 21 to 25 and accept with alacrity one from 26 to 32 “ ‘argo’ was a twentyeight” he explained showing his addition “ben was a three as a director—he was ‘good’—and now he’s a four ‘argo’ says ‘godzilla’ was a twenty on the high end of ‘consider’ i was dubious but when i read the script i was surprised—you care about these people and you’ve got godzilla”after a thirteenhour day at the wastetreatment plant a day that had been smelly noisy and numbingly fluorescent cranston retained an expectant “where’s the afterparty” air “as they take the wig off i’ll put a hot towel on my face and wash the character away” he said “and it’s then for the first time that i’ll realize how tired i am remember the plate spinner on the ‘sullivan’ show i’m a plate spinner i used to think you could never have too many”for years cranston scrabbled after gueststar roles on crappy tv shows while making his living in commercials he played a bland smoothie with breadloaf hair who just happened to love shield deodorant soap arrow shirts coffeemate and excedrin a middleofthebellcurve guy who despite his initial skepticism was really sold on the product “now you can relieve inflamed hemorrhoidal tissue with the oxygen action of preparation h” he says “i had that everyman look—nonthreatening nondistracting no facial hair i fit in”as he was often the last person cast on a show or film his strategy was to play the opposite of what the ensemble already had drama is conflict after all when he auditioned for the father on “malcolm in the middle” the fox sitcom about a crew of unruly brothers he knew that the boys’ mother was bombastic fearless and insightful so he played the father as gentle timid and obtuse “it was a genius way to make an underwritten part work” linwood boomer the show’s creator says “by the third episode we realized we had to do a lot more writing for the guy”“malcolm” aired from 2000 to 2006 and established cranston as a television fixture if not a star yet even after he landed the lead in “breaking bad” in 2007 he framed his character walter white as an opposite—in this case the opposite of the man walter would become the show is about a fiftyyearold highschool chemistry teacher in albuquerque who after getting a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer secretly works with a former student the sweet yoyo jesse pinkman aaron paul to make enough crystal meth to leave a nest egg for his family walt’s extremely pure product becomes wildly successful but at great cost to everyone around him vince gilligan the show’s creator and executive producer had sold it to the amc network as “a man who goes from mr chips to scarface” and in the pilot walt tells his students that chemistry is “the study of change” but cranston quietly shifted the arc from goodmanbecomesbad to invisiblemanbecomesvivid in preproduction gilligan recalls cranston began to construct an ideal nebbish “bryan said ‘i think i should have a mustache and it should be light and thin and look like a dead caterpillar and i should be pale and a little doughier a hundred and eightysix pounds’ ”cranston explains “i wanted walt to have the body type of my dad who’s now eightynine like walt was a much older man when i was studying my dad taking on his posture and burdens—i didn’t tell him i was doing it—i noticed i was also taking on some of his characteristics the ‘aw jeez’ or an eye roll or”—he gave a skeptical grimace—“when jesse did something stupid”gilligan an amiable fatalistic virginian says “i had a very schematic understanding of walt in the early going i was thinking structurally we’d have a good man beset from all sides by remorseless fate” not only does walt have cancer an empty savings account and searing regrets about his career path but his son has cerebral palsy and his wife skyler is unexpectedly pregnant gilligan gave a wry smile “the truth is you have to be very schematic indeed to force someone into cooking crystal meth”instead cranston played the role so that walter’s lungcancer diagnosis catalyzes a gaudy midlife crisis—so that a luna moth breaks from the drabbest of cocoons across the show’s five seasons which depict a lively two years walt is increasingly inhabited by heisenberg his drugdealing pseudonym and alter ego—a figure cranston describes as “the emotionless brave risktaking imaginary friend who looks out for walt’s best interests” early in the first season when walt scurries out of his pontiac aztek to retrieve the drug dealer krazy8 who lies unconscious on a suburban corner in broad daylight he’s terrified of being seen and takes tiny nerdy steps his shoulders twitching with selfconsciousness there is a touch of hal the father cranston played on “malcolm in the middle” about him still—he might almost waggle his hands in panic for comic effect the first season of the show was particularly funny if darkly so and vince gilligan asked his colleagues whether he should submit it to the emmys as a drama or a comedy cartoon ida17646after undergoing chemotherapy walt shaves his head and grows a vandyke alphamale plumage that helps him play the bruiser by the end of the second season he rousts two wouldbe meth cooks from his territory with pure assurance a wide stance arms relaxed yet poised to strike and when he reveals his hidden powers to his wife in the famous “i am the one who knocks” speech he levels his hand at her like a gun “the more believable humanity of walter white—the discovery that he’s not a good man but an everyman—is due to bryan” gilligan said “the writers realized from his acting that walt isn’t cooking for his family he’s cooking for himself”by the fifth season having killed krazy8 and become responsible for at least a hundred and ninetyfour other deaths walt has no anxiety left his voice is low and commanding his manner brash—he’s eager to be seen he was cowed at first by his brotherinlaw hank schrader a bluff d e a agent who treats him with kindly contempt but soon enough he’s snarling at hank “i’m done explaining myself” and taunting him for misidentifying heisenberg “this genius of yours maybe he’s still out there” then he eliminates his boss a drug lord named gus fring giancarlo esposito by blowing his face off with a wheelchair bomb as walt takes on the role of the dominant dealer cranston has him unconsciously appropriate some of esposito’s coiled stillness “i wanted to plant a subliminal thing with the audience” he says “but it was bryan who modelled walt’s body language on gus’s—walt didn’t know what he was doing all he knew is that he felt more confident with his shoulders back”in movies unless you’re the star you’re going to play an archetype studios noticing the authority in cranston’s persona have often cast him as a colonel “saving private ryan” “john carter” “red tails” ben affleck who hired him to be the c i a’s version of a colonel in “argo” says “bryan is the boss you might actually like he’s not a general and he’s not a sergeant—he’s a colonel” yet cranston’s friend jason alexander who starred as george costanza on “seinfeld” says “bryan doesn’t play an idea particularly well those military roles that’s because his strongest card is complexity where you can’t figure out what he represents until he gradually reveals himself” a producer friend of cranston’s observes that he doesn’t stand out in such films as “total recall” where he chewed the scenery as a dictator “because he wasn’t reined in actors want to act but you need someone who will say ‘give me the take where he’s doing less’ ”a cable series a format that showcases accretive subtlety is where cranston could truly shine luckily cable’s golden age arrived just as he did “bryan had to grow into his weight as an actor” john o’hurley a close friend of cranston’s since the mideighties when they were both married to the same woman on the soap opera “loving” says “he became dangerous when he began letting his eyes go dead it’s the sign of a man with nothing to lose”in hollywood where everyone routinely calls everyone else a genius the praise cranston inspires is remarkably fervent it borders on envy not just of his talent but of his expansive approach to life “bryan would be the guy to be stuck on a desert island with” jane kaczmarek who played the mother on “malcolm in the middle” says “not only would he be great company but he’d build you a hut and find you some food” “breaking bad” ’s aaron paul says “he’s my mentor and hands down the greatest guy i’ll ever work with” and frankie muniz who played malcolm on “malcolm in the middle” says “i remember thinking man i want to be bryan when i’m older he was like the perfect hollywood movie dad he was almost too perfect”cranston’s warmth and his interest in helping young people are genuine he and his wife are mainstays of the national center for missing  exploited children they are also an aspect of the public work of being “bryan cranston” which of late has become an extremely demanding role when i walked around manhattan with the actor last fall he was unfailingly charming with the many many people who recognized him as walter white when one woman wanted her picture taken with him after he posed for one with her boyfriend he snarled “i’ll take a photo with him but you you disgust me” then he laughed and flung an arm around her“bryan’s really good at it” robin dearden says “but it takes him longer to shut that off than it does to get out of character—it usurps his energy overwhelms him when he comes home the last thing he wants is a woman’s chat”—she laughed “i try not to take it personally when he gets curt because one reason he gets exhausted is that after years of trying so hard to get anything he could he doesn’t have that gauge of ‘o k i’ve done enough now’ ”fame can blunt an actor’s acuity he can’t study people because they’re always studying him cranston says “i used to just watch people at malls to get out of that rut where there’s too much of you seeping into your roles where your character is ‘me but with a hat’ ” by way of example he cycled rapidly through robert de niro’s scowl jimmy stewart’s stammer and al pacino’s chesty roar “but now when i watch people working to get away from my bryanisms”—the tics taken from his father a saggingjaw move he does to demonstrate awe—“i have to wear dark glasses and ear buds and nod my head so people think i’m listening to music” he avoids dining out and has developed tricks for gliding around incognito feigning interest in his cell phone sitting near older people in airport lounges because they’re less likely to recognize him “i wouldn’t mind being a hermit when i’m not working” he told me playing other people allows cranston to be most vividly himself in late june he spent four hours in a basement sound studio on the dream works animation lot in glendale it was his first recording session for “kung fu panda 3” in which he’ll play a new character lee shen—the biological father of jack black’s po the first scenes went slowly as the director jennifer yuh nelson nudged cranston to make lee stern yet not uncaring and to sharpen the enmity between lee and mr ping the talkative goose who raised po late in the day cranston’s stomach growled and he said as lee “i’m still hungry i should have eaten that goose” warming to the idea he became a broadcaster “true hollywood confessions when ‘kung fu panda’ went horribly wrong” he bent down as cranston again to answer an imaginary phone call from the head of the studio “yes mr katzenberg” he whispered “no no—it wasn’t me it was jennifer she went crazy” he listened his eyes widening as if katzenberg were reading his thoughts “yes exactly like a drunken goose”one afternoon cranston set aside some time to check on his prostheses knb efx group the specialeffects studio that did the makeup for “breaking bad” had made him a skijump nose buddha earlobes and saggy cheeks tethered to a cleft chin the actor was going to play lyndon johnson in robert schenkkan’s “all the way” a show about johnson’s first year as president it opens this week in cambridge massachusetts preparing for a bid at broadway cranston was uncertain he was up to the challenge which thrilled him he’d been reading everything he could about johnson and listening to his oval office tapes but the physical appropriation would be his gateway in at knb in a room presided over by a maquette of doctor evil a technician dabbed on the appliqués and turned cranston to the mirror “aw jeez” cranston said delighted “i already have the thin lips the forehead lines and pinched brow and the receding hairline and hooded eyes so now imagine the hair back” he practiced working his lobes into place murmuring “now now it’s just a girl putting on earrings is all” cranston’s voice eased toward a texas hill country drawl breathy yet clenched so “now” came out as “na” “it’s scary” he said “but you try to trust that the more you absorb through osmosis the more he becomes a part of me and then suddenly”—he patted his belly—“oh there he is” he turned strode up too close and thumped me on the chest “na come on tad ya gonna hep me with this vote”the actors cranston looks to—spencer tracy jack lemmon rod steiger—make you forget you’re watching a performance you think of them not as stars but in specific roles the presentday actor he most admires is mark rylance a brit best known for his galvanic theatrical work he told me “he’s got a little more recklessness maybe it feels like if they told mark ‘oh your character enters masturbating full frontal’ he’d go ‘sure let’s try that tonight’ whereas if i’m honest i’d go ‘oh wow—really hmm’ ”if cranston has boundaries in his acting they’re not immediately apparent in the “malcolm in the middle” pilot he was introduced as a naked man whose wife was shaving his pelt of body hair actually gluedon yak hair “he was so relaxed we thought that there might be something wrong with him that he might be too into it” linwood boomer says the show’s writers tried to devise an indignity that would make cranston balk but he embraced them all from gyrating in the nude as the ballad “show and tell” played to being covered with thirty thousand live bees cranston always lets bees land on him mystified by his companions’ alarm but in this case he admits “one of them stung me right on the nutsack”robin dearden says “there are two things bryan owns that i wish i had he doesn’t worry and he’s not afraid and because he’s not afraid the bees don’t sting him his whole premise in life is ‘what have you got to lose’ i think that comes from his childhood he fell off the cliff they all went over and there really wasn’t any more to lose”a few months ago cranston gazed at his childhood home a small threebedroom ranch house in canoga park at the cheaper end of los angeles’s san fernando valley there were mounds of cigarette butts and trash bags by the door and a dead toyota in the yard “it’s bad it’s a shitty house now” he said turning to the street “me and my older brother kyle and the neighborhood boys would play baseball here”—a hedge marked the outfield wall—“and do the resin gag driving people crazy at night with resin on a string ‘squeak squeak squeak’ ” if they got bored they could ride the cranstons’ pet donkey tom cranston’s parents joe and peggy met in an acting class and cranston the middle of three children was born in 1956 he was a freckled kid with an impish squint whose nickname was sneaky pete “i was sly i guess always looking for shortcuts” he said “ ‘what do i need to do to get a c’ ” his father who’d been a boxer in his youth and who still settled disputes with his fists was a handsome gregarious man who appeared in shows such as “dragnet” and “my three sons” and drivein movies like “beginning of the end” in which he was devoured by locusts joe was always cooking up moneymaking schemes a trampoline park a night club attached to a bowling alley houses he’d flip for two hundred and fifty dollars down “we put in a pool one year” cranston said “and then my mother said we couldn’t afford the chemicals to swim in it so we just let the water stagnate” from the look of things—cranston shinnied up the back fence to take a peek—the water hadn’t been changed since his parents separated when he was twelve “my dad wanted desperately to be successful and he wasn’t and it just brought him to his knees” cranston said “he stole away some other guy’s wife” according to joe cranston the relationship began after he and the woman were separated from their spouses “it was a real love affair for them but    i remember lying to my friends saying ‘oh yeah—my dad comes home late at night he gets us up in the morning we play’ ” cartoon ida17696the family’s house was foreclosed on and bryan and kyle lived with their mother’s parents for a time while their mother and their younger sister amy moved in with their father’s mother it was a painful and confusing period peggy cranston brought the kids with her to divorce proceedings but didn’t explain that she and joe were getting divorced afterward she and the children lived with three boarders in a house that had one bathroom surviving on food stamps “my mother had a great zest for life but when my father rejected her it just destroyed her” cranston said “she became like blanche du bois with men she wallowed in anxiety depression and alcoholism and she lived in clutter” at cranston’s house now—a comfortable clapboard affair with a pool out back at the palmier end of the valley—he labels everything and expects his wife and daughter to put in at least an hour a week tidying up the elementary school down the street was a refuge in fifth grade cranston got the lead role of professor flipnoodle in the school play “the time machine” one of his lines was “president lincoln will finish writing the gettysburg address when he returns to the white house” instead he said “to the white front” a local chain store “boom life stopped” he recalled “every single person was laughing at me there were i’m not exaggerating men kneeling in the aisles helpless with laughter” kyle cranston says “it was very embarrassing for bryan and for our parents but i thought it was hilarious” “it was awful ” cranston continued “the experience probably had something to do with me pushing away from performing for a long time” in high school he was the top cadet in the l a p d law enforcement explorers program and he thought he might become a cop the cranston children didn’t see their father for ten years “my recollection is of a single mom and two older brothers who were my dads” amy cranston says joe cranston told me in his apartment “the family fell apart everything fell apart” he shaded his eyes then flicked his hand away “i like to omit that period of my life” joe lives in studio city a few miles from bryan and has fourteen prospective screenplays ready to go a number of them are tailormade for his son to star in most recently a fourteenmilliondollar action project called “g r a b”cranston who gently resists his father’s blandishments said “i try to remember the good stuff—him coaching my little league team or putting up the christmas lights together” standing on the street in front of his old house he took a last squint “someone else’s life now” he said evenly then strode to his audi“in writers’ rooms being nerds we talk in terms of characters’ superpowers” vince gilligan says “on the face of it you’d think walt’s superpower is his scientific genius but in our minds walt’s superpower is his ability to effortlessly lie to everyone and the person he’s best at lying to is himself” walt’s lies are a reagent that leaches candor and trust from every relationship in the third episode of the final eight skyler assures her sister marie schrader and marie’s husband hank that walt’s out of the meth game marie cries “how can we believe anything you say there’s no telling where the lies begin and end”the series is a meditation on performance hank pretends that he doesn’t have p t s d skyler pretends to be a ditz to make the i r s drop its criminal pursuit of her old boss jesse growls threats at his dealers over the phone then looks to walt for approval walt has just challenged jesse in one of the show’s touchstone speeches to play the role he cast him for “what does the blowfish do jesse what does the blowfish do    the blowfish puffs himself up” jesse was supposed to be killed off during the first season and then gilligan recognized that aaron paul’s jesse and cranston’s walt met like flint and steel but the warmth of jesse and walt’s fatherson bond is also laced with violence suspicion and on walt’s part a searing contempt for jesse’s gullibility it isn’t walt’s horrific treatment of his wife that gradually alienates viewers it’s the ruthless duplicity of his actions toward jesse—his beloved son the patsy the progress of walter’s deceptive skill has a symphonic rise and fall early in the series when skyler accuses him one night of keeping a secret cell phone he makes all the rookie mistakes “a second cell phone” he says eyes wide and mouth agape the next morning compounding the error he revisits the topic as he spins a threadbare yarn his hands fly up to flap skyler’s doubts away which only confirms her suspicions walt soon gets wise to this tell and begins stuffing his hands in his pockets when he lies—except when he’s lying to himself in the third season he walks away from meth and informs gus that an appeal to vanity won’t get him to return “you believe i have some proprietary kind of selfishness about my own formula” he says almost sneering “some sort of”—hand flap—“overweening pride i suppose that you think simply”—hand flap—“overwhelms me” yep in the middle episodes of these final eight when walt tells whoppers to skyler about how he got soaked in gasoline or his urgent need to fix a soda machine where he’s hidden a pistol his hands again flap wildly that’s because he’s tried to suppress heisenberg—and cranston says because “walt is shot through with adrenaline and having to invent excuses on the fly human behavior never follows a smooth line” when walt has time to plan as when he makes a “confession” tape in which he blackheartedly names hank as the real criminal mastermind his hands stay relaxed heisenberg is back in charge gilligan says “walter white is the best actor in the world of ‘breaking bad’ if you saw that confession tape you’d think this d e a asshole really ran a number on the poor guy sitting on the edge of the bed” yet because walt’s superpower has been revealed no one believes him even when he’s telling the truth in this past sunday’s episode walt begs jesse to recall all the ways he’s protected him over the years pleading “don’t you know me by now” jesse replies “i know you’re a lying evil scumbag that’s what i know” this occurs while jesse is flimflamming walt into disclosing where he buried his money in the desert “the student has become the teacher” gilligan says even people who worked on the show lost their faith in walt melissa bernstein a coproducer says “to the rest of us it felt like by the middle of the series walt had crossed over had made too many bad choices but bryan never let go of walt—he felt so strongly that there were pure motives there” cranston hopes that “breaking bad” will earn a place in the canon of american tragedies and argues that the show will be tragic only if the audience believes to the end that walt can still reverse his course in the second season he told gilligan “i really think walt’s doing it for his family” and gilligan replied “no i think he’s actually kind of selfish” gilligan says “it dawned on me slowly that i was telling the actor he’s mistaken about his own character—and that my stupidity was jeopardizing the whole show you don’t have to be freud to know that hitler thought of himself as a wonderful guy”smiling tightly cranston says “i was able to keep that conversation at bay” the actor can’t let himself know things that he knows and so for a long time cranston has been lying to himself that the monster he carries in his belly is a wonderful dad for two years cranston went to los angeles valley college where he earned an associate’s degree in police science—and discovered when he took acting as an elective that it awakened a longslumbering curiosity after graduating he left on a motorcycle trip around the country with his brother kyle it was 1976 and they were influenced as much by the tv show “then came bronson” with its harleydavidsonriding hero as by “on the road” they worked at cafés and carnivals to cover food and gas and slept behind schools and churches meandering through more than forty states in two years in daytona beach they sold hawaiian tropic suntan oil by day and acted at the daytona playhouse by night one evening as the king was dying in “the king and i” cranston playing the retainer kralahome felt the undercoat of vaseline on his eyelids melting into his eyes “the tears start to flow and i hear gasps in the first ten rows they are thinking oh my god this guy is so into his role it was a total accident but i got so much praise and i realized that in acting—unlike in high school—if you show vulnerability you become attractive it’s like you’ve suddenly got a grenade power was at hand”when cranston was twentyone he and kyle took refuge from a heavy rain under a picnic shelter off the blue ridge parkway in virginia the storm lasted six days one afternoon having exhausted the timekilling powers of gin rummy and pushups cranston began reading “hedda gabler” when he looked up it was dark instantly he says “i understood that this is what i should be doing with my life i came up with this motto ‘find something you love and hopefully become good at’—as opposed to ‘find something you’re good at and hopefully fall in love with’ ”he moved back to los angeles with his girlfriend an actress named mickey middleton and began taking acting classes he and middleton married in 1979 and divorced two years later if he felt too comfortable in a class or too in thrall to its teacher he’d move on he studied meisner and improv tried est   smalland psychotherapy and scientology and even worked as a comedian to conquer his fear of doing standup “it was like putting together a bouquet” he says after a few years he began getting gueststar shots on tv shows such as “murder she wrote” and “matlock” where the job was to wear an illfitting sports jacket and either get killed just after saying something like “all right sissy—cool it” or get caught just after saying something like “there’s no way you can prove any of this” cranston shotgunned postcards out to casting directors to alert them to these appearances “i knew ninetynine per cent of them wouldn’t watch but my face and name would get in front of them and it would plant the subliminal message ‘he works a lot this guy’ ” he kept at it for more than a decade without appreciable progress in the eighties his characters sent their loot to a swiss bank account and in the nineties to the cayman islands the best thing about the guest spots was that in 1986 on a dudeswithahelicopter show called “airwolf” he struck up a lunchtime friendship with a funny and engaging costar robin dearden they were married in 1989 and their daughter taylor was born in 1993 though cranston was making a good living from commercials he felt close to creative despair early in their marriage he told dearden “i feel i’m stuck on the junior varsity” so she gave him a gift of private sessions with the selfhelp guru breck costin who suggested that he focus on process not outcome cranston says “it incrementally came to me that when i audition i’m not trying to get a job but to give them something my acting the victory is not ‘did i beat that other guy out’ but ‘did i present that character as believably as i could’ that was the turning point”in the midnineties he gained some notice on “seinfeld” in the recurring role of tim whatley a smarmy “dentist to the stars” and in 1996 he landed a guest spot as a homeless guy on “diagnosis murder” starring dick van dyke watching the episode now you can see cranston rising above the material as when he instructs van dyke how to go undercover as a vagrant walk like your feet hurt lose the smile van dyke says “i told bryan ‘i haven’t seen anyone that good on the show’ and then i told everyone i could about this guy” joe cranston recalls with perhaps a touch of exaggeration that van dyke “took me by the shoulders and said ‘your son is the greatest actor of all time’ ”cranston often credits luck with his elevation to the varsity in 1998 he got to play the astronaut buzz aldrin on the hbo miniseries “from the earth to the moon” when another actor showed up too fat for the spacesuit he landed the role on “malcolm in the middle” two days before production began jane kaczmarek says “after all the hairy fat guys didn’t work out” and gilligan cast him in “breaking bad” because he recalled an episode of “the xfiles” he’d written in 1998 in which cranston played a redneck roofer—a part he’d got largely because he auditioned wearing drumstick sideburns and a bushy mustache which he’d grown to play a redneck mechanic in an indie film called “last chance” cartoon ida17721yet luck is the residue of design and devotion cranston wrote and directed “last chance” which starred robin dearden as a birthday gift to her and he made his “xfiles” role menacing yet memorably sympathetic giving his racist roofer the trembling hands of someone who’d been picked on in school cranston had three emmy nominations for “malcolm” and each time he took out sly “for your consideration” ads promoting his work “it’s a game and i know the game” he explains “the whole idea is to put yourself in a position to be recognized for your work so opportunities increase false humility or even laziness could prevent that”on “breaking bad” cranston tried to keep the set free of emotional clutter his philosophy was “let’s save the drama for in front of the cameras” in an industry where actors average a blowup a day he had just one in five years after the writers countermanded the blocking that the actors had worked out for a scene “it was disrespectful—it was an encroachment into my world” he says but all he did in response was state his position firmly and take a long walk he wrote postmortem emails to the other actors after each season  this year was great but we can still do better  hosted an annual bowling party for the crew and made sure everyone showed up to publicize the show at the television critics association conference dean norris who played hank says “bryan set the example on set in the talkingpillow scene”—when walt’s extended family gathers to encourage him to undergo chemo—“he cried every single time even when the camera was on one of the rest of us but he also set the example for how to be a professional the work ethic i was more ‘ah fuck this’ and he told me ‘you can’t be the “ah fuck this” guy they’re paying you a lot of money so you need to play your role and be a member of the “breaking bad” team you need to grow up’ ”after the third season cranston told gilligan he wanted to be one of the show’s producers “i wanted it for future credibility” the actor says “it is important to me to come across as the leader—i like the power the empowerment” gilligan who viewed producers’ titles as a writers’ prerogative was resistant cranston explained all that he did “i am a liaison to the actors and the crew i travel and give interview after interview—i am a promoting machine i am the face of the show” gilligan looked into it and discovered he says that “in large part it was bryan who was keeping the ship from foundering” so he acquiesced—just as he had also reluctantly when cranston came to him after the first season and asked to direct an episode “bryan was very much the dad of this series” gilligan says “even i looked to him as the dad”for all his geniality cranston has a barbed side one day he got a call from a nurse at his mother’s assistedliving facility informing him that his mother who had alzheimer’s had taken up with an equally senescent man and that they’d “formalized” their relationship “i know it must concern you greatly to imagine your mother with someone other than your father” she said cranston whose parents had been married a total of seven times said that it did greatly “what if she gets pregnant”anna gunn who played walt’s wife grew close to cranston and they’d often banter between takes she recalls “in the second season as things got tense between walt and skyler bryan said some harsh things that made me go ‘wow’ ” after their characters’ new baby holly was born cranston would often suggest that walt be closer to her “he’d be holding the baby and he’d go ‘yes that’s right holly yes your mother is cold and doesn’t care’ ” gunn says “because it was a very male set where all the men were siding with walt the humor would just hit me in the stomach so i took bryan aside feeling a bit like a little girl and said ‘i get hurt because i’m so much my character’s advocate’ and he said ‘i am so sorry my humor can be cutting and i sometimes forget how vulnerable you can be’ ”cranston says matteroffactly “i often find myself in a pickle and having to apologize because that’s what risktakers have to do in a regular workplace you’re not supposed to pat someone on the ass in our world if you pat someone on the ass or say something crazy you’re rewarded for it you’re supposed to get into the character’s deepest feelings” so he grew fatherly toward his screen children and possessive of his screen wife when skyler began sleeping with her boss ted beneke cranston says “i felt jealousy and resentment and anger i treated chris cousins”—who played ted—“horribly good actor and good man but i didn’t like him when he arrived in makeup i’d say ‘oh boy— here’s the asshole’ ”at the end of the second season walt feels that he is losing jesse his true son to jesse’s girlfriend jane one night walt finds the couple in jesse’s bed passed out from using heroin—and then jane vomits and starts to choke “breaking bad” scripts are unusually dense with stage directions and the script dictated that walt having realized “it serves him better if she keeps choking ” decides not to help her which prompts “a look of horror of fear and revulsion” the scene was intended as a milepost in walt’s moral decay in an earlier version rejected by amc as too much of a leap walt pushes jane onto her back to make her choke vince gilligan says “what you see on film is walt’s surprise alarm then fear then the realization of opportunity then sadness and selfloathing and then acceptance and a hardening of resolve—all in a few seconds but great as it was on camera there was some heat that came off bryan in the room something powerful and elusive—almost as if he put it across on the infrared band”cranston says he prepared “by thinking about the proandcon list the way walt would—about how if jane dies jesse stays alive but in acting you open yourself and in one of the takes as i was thinking about how it was someone’s daughter lying there i was suddenly looking down at my own daughter’s face taylor popped in and it made me gasp”“i gave bryan a hug afterward” anna gunn says “and he just grabbed me and held on crying” it took him nearly fifteen minutes to stop “it got him in a place he didn’t expect a dark place”the lines blurred for everyone when walt turned his heisenberg face on skyler gunn almost couldn’t stand it “it was like something came over the sun and something would drop in my stomach and i’d feel so alone and scared and angry” she says “i don’t know where he goes and i don’t want to know” rian johnson the director of three of the series’ strongest episodes including the one that airs this sunday which gilligan calls the show’s best says “when you talk to bryan and he’s thinking about a scene his face gets that heisenberg look he says he achieves it just by letting his face go blank but it bores into you and i found myself stammering”cranston fixed me with his blank stare to demonstrate that his face is naturally “mean” and the experience was like a cold walk in the uncanny valley jason alexander who’s received the heisenberg from cranston at the poker table defined the feeling “it can be particularly chilling when someone who gives you such joy turns off the source of it it makes you think wait—which one is real”cranston runs for exercise and every so often he’ll be jogging along and realize that his face is contorted with anger—“rage blasting out of my body a rush of toxins and rage” his sister amy says “he gets a lot of hostility out by running and it’s always tied back to childhood or his father” running releases what remains from acting “part of me—of any human being—is really dark” cranston told me in his living room “and this with walt is how i work through my issues it’s much easier for me to allow the character to explode than it is for bryan to open up” he sat thinking “i wouldn’t consider myself closed or open i’m   ” he treaded water a moment “i’m ‘on lunch break back in an hour’ ”as “breaking bad” ’s fourth season wound down gilligan recalls “bryan came to me and said ‘you really want to end the show’ ” cranston believed that they had two seasons left in them but gilligan fearing he’d run out of story had decided on one “it was like ‘say it ain’t so joe’ ” gilligan told me “i felt i was betraying him” cranston admits “i didn’t want to let go of the greatest experience of my professional life” at a party after the final episode wrapped he had the “breaking bad” logo tattooed on the inside of his right ring finger the interplay between the show’s two fathers kept the story moving generally gilligan was the architect and cranston the builder but it got complicated gilligan who says fear is his creative engine would bang his head against a wall when he was blocked and at times found himself envying walt’s freedom “there’s a neurotic wish fulfillment in a cancer diagnosis how liberating it would be how it would make your daily worries go away” and cranston was building at times from his own blueprints heisenberg is who he might have turned into if he’d become a cop in the final season when cranston suggested that walt start womanizing—“if you’re a conquering hero you grab a wench and say ‘you’re having sex with me’ ”—gilligan wisely let the idea die when the script had walt acknowledge that he’d shot his partner mike needlessly cranston held up production for an hour because he believed the line would turn walt into a putz and trivialize mike’s death as the sun set over the rio grande cranston finally uttered the line but in a dazed way that made walt not quite responsible for it the last creative debate took place over the first episode of the final eight walt realizing that his brotherinlaw is on to him goes to his house to suss him out after a violent confrontation in which hank punches him in the face he demonstrates what a good liar he’d make on the stand “i’m a dying man who runs a car wash—my right hand to god that is all i am” bewildered and heartsick hank replies “i don’t even know who i’m talking to” walt says “if that’s true—if you don’t know who i am    then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly”the scene was written for walt to unleash his powers gilligan says “we wanted the showmanship of having heisenberg come out” but cranston who was directing the episode argued “walter knows this discovery has crushed hank and he doesn’t want to crush him anymore” he and gilligan finally arrived at a way to play the scene when hank suggests a reconciliation—why doesn’t walt bring skyler and the kids over and they’ll all talk—walt flashes a menacing hint of heisenberg “i said ‘that’s not going to happen’ ” cranston told me and “i let my eyes go dead” but the “tread lightly” speech ended up being mostly a dying man’s plea to his brotherinlaw to remember the relationship that they once had the idea was that walt having outfoxed hank now genuinely pities him and seeks his pity in return but dean norris says “when bryan played it so walt was really listening to hank it was so much scarier—you could see walt contemplating what it was like to have become a monster and almost weeping it was badass and scary and sad all at the same time and i wanted to reach out and give him a hug bryan’s so transparent in his eyes that people still root for that guy one of the most evil monsters out there”your conclusion about that scene and about the final eight depends on whether you believe that walt can keep heisenberg at bay or whether you suspect that heisenberg is using walt as a decoy even as the character’s mortality comes knocking cranston somehow keeps both narratives—the triumph of the brave cold dad and of the fearful warm one—alive the walter that he leaves us with gilligan says “isn’t freshwater and he isn’t seawater the man is purely brackish” ♦
