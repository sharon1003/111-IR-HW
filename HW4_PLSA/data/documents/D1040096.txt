presidential elections were held in syria on 3 june 2014 it was the first multicandidate election in decades since the baath party came to power in a coup in late april 2014 bashar alassad announced he would run for a third term in syrias first multicandidate direct presidential election as a result of the ongoing syrian civil war since march 2011 syria has the largest refugee population in the world and voting for refugees in certain foreign countries began at syrian embassies several days before voting took place in syria itself 1 domestic and foreignbased syrian opposition groups boycotted the election 1 2 and the vote did not take place in large parts of syria under rebel control 3 the areas under kurdish militia control also did not allow voting due to the refusal of the government to recognize their regional autonomy though some people still traveled to the government–controlled areas to vote 4some rebel groups vowed to disrupt the elections in any way possible including bombing and shelling polling stations and governmentcontrolled areas 5 6 7 8 another statement issued by the ajnad alsham islamic union the sham corps the army of mujahedeen and the islamic front said they would not target voters but warned people to stay at home in case the syrian government did there were 50 reported deaths from the shelling by the rebels 9bashar alassad was sworn in for his third sevenyear term on july 16 2014 in the presidential palace in damascus 10 the gulf cooperation council the european union and the united states dismissed the election as illegitimate 11 12 13 14 members of this coalition have been condemned by supporters of assad for supposedly precipitating the civil war through what they claim is the invasion of syria which is illegal under international law the un charter and for providing material and financial support for the terrorist groups  15 16 17 18 19 20 attempts to hold an election under the circumstances of an ongoing civil war were criticized by un secretary general ban kimoon 21 and it was widely reported that the elections lacked independent election monitoring 22 however an international delegation from more than 30

andor ethnic grounds the ukbased syrian observatory for human rights states that the war has claimed over 150000 lives 25 one third of the countrys population of 23 million 26 some 7 million have been displaced with 25 million as refugees in foreign countries 27a spokesperson for the united nations secretary general ban kimoon warned that amid the ongoing syrian civil war and largescale displacement of syrian citizens such elections are incompatible with the letter and spirit of the geneva communiqué and would damage prospects of a political solution with the opposition we will nonetheless continue to search and build upon any opening to a solution to the tragedy in syria 21 28 syrian rebels and opposition parties refused to attend the peace conference the ultimate goal of the geneva communiqué unless assad was removed from power and barred from any future leadership position the peace talks had failed before they ever began because what was intended to be a negotiation became only an ultimatum the derailment of the peace talks is in stark contrast to the stated goals of the un towards resolving the conflict 29 30refugees  editthe 25 million refugees and their ability to vote has resulted in several controversies surrounding this election hundreds of thousands of refugees who did not leave syria officially via border posts have been excluded from voting

refugeesqatar saudi arabia turkey hosted syrian refugeesunited arab emirates united kingdom united states electoral system  editthe new constitution adopted following the syrian constitutional referendum 2012 has changed the nature of the presidential election from a referendum to a multicandidate electoral ballot as a result this election marks the first time that candidates can challenge the incumbent president the first nominally democratic election in syrias history a law adopted by the syrian parliament in early 2014 restricts candidacy to individuals who have lived in syria for the past ten years thereby preventing exiled people from running 37on 8 april syrian information minister omran zoabi announced that candidates will be able to submit their applications during the last ten days of april zoabi insisted that despite the ongoing civil war that the election would proceed on schedule and wouldnt be delayed for any reason zoabi also claimed that the overwhelming majority of syrians wished to see incumbent president bashar alassad reelected 37 zoabi also claimed that government military operations would continue despite the election 38eligibility criteria

president leader of baath party hassan abdullah alnouri from the national initiative for administration and change in syria a 54yearold mp from damascus maher abd alhafiz hajjar formerly from the peoples will party a 43yearold mp from aleppo this party is led by veteran opposition leader qadri jamil who supported the initial protests in 2011 but then described calls for the overthrow of the government as  unrealistic and useless  jamil was a member of the committee that drafted the new constitution of syria in 2011 however peoples will won just two of 250 mps in the 2012 parliamentary election with their allies from the syrian social nationalist party won a further four jamil was nominated deputy prime minister by president assad in june 2012 but was removed in october 2013 the small number of mps from the party indicates that most of his nominations must have come from either independents or mps from the ruling national progressive front a statement from the peoples will party on 27 april distanced the party from hajjar claiming that hajjar was no longer a member of either the peoples will party or the popular front for liberation and change instead the statement claimed that hajjar represented only himself 44the other 21 candidates that did not meet the criteria were 45sawsan omar alhaddad born in latakia governorate in 1963 womansameer ahmad moalla born in

for bashar alassad is correct to the nearest single voter similarly the proportion for niacs comes out at 0042999938 and for the independent party at 0031999985 but whilst gelmans argument provides strong evidence that the published counts were fabricated he admits that it does not preclude the theory that those numbers could have been generated retrospectively and unprofessionally from valid
