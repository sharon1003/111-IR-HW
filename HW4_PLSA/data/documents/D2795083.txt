recruiting organisation for the army the acf is a youth organisation only about 25 of cadets join the army and do so because they want to the acf is sponsored and helped by the army because it does some military training and uses army equipment and accommodation military training is a good way of developing the person is it all military training no all acf cadets follow a basic military training syllabus throughout their time in the acf it forms about half of what they do in the acf they also do many other activities such as service to their community the duke of edinburghs award scheme adventurous training sports and a variety of hobbies such as being in our very own world famous bandwhat qualifications will i gain from training its up to you you can gain several recognised qualifications through acf training and activities such as a btec nvq in public service essentials of first aid st john ambulance and public first aid certificates duke of edinburghs bronze silver or gold awards and others from courses run by the army but the biggest gain is in your own development achieved through the training and experience that the acf gives you is shooting included yes the acf takes part in target shooting it is a very popular sport with cadets very thorough training is given in the safe handling of weapons before any cadet is allowed to shoot and all shooting is done under close and strict supervision of trained and qualified instructors on acf or army ranges cadets never handle weapons except under the supervision of trained adult instructors it is a very good way of teaching the need for care and safety and for encouraging a sense of responsibility in teenagers also if you are interested you will be able to take part in shooting competitions for the county such as the cadet small arms competition when can i leave the acf anytime  there are no restrictions as to how long you have to be a member for all that we ask for is your uniform and any other kit that you may have borrowed to be brought back to us as soon as possible to enable us to distribute it to other new cadets becoming a leader the acf is not part of the army there is no callup liability it isnt the ta nor is it designed to make you or anyone else join the army in fact the acf is a youth organisation sponsored by the ministry of defence which offers young people and the adult leaders as well many opportunities to try exciting and adventurous activities which you maybe never thought aboutthe army cadet force is directly dependent on the commitment of its volunteer adult leaders some of whom are excadets themselves and live and work in the local community as an adult leader you will need to put a lot in to the acf  but you will get a lot out will i get paid for being an adult instructor in the acf the short answer is yes but no one joins for the money you will get paid at rates of pay similar to those of the territorial army for up to 28 days per year however it is not something any acf adult instructor focus on and most do many more days for the enjoyment of it the real rewards are seeing cadets turn into promising young men and women who will make a positive contribution to society would i get paid any expenses allowances for out of pocket travelling expenses are available as an adult instructor in the acf would i be liable for military call up in the event of a national emergency no adult instructors are not liable for military duty before becoming an acf adult instructor will i have to undergo any security vetting yes because you will be working with young people we have to check that you do not have anything which would bar you from contact with children this process is now carried out by all organistions working with young people and takes a short while during your initial induction period do i need any specialist skills or previous experience to become an adult instructor with the acf no the acf will teach you all you need to know about the military skills and about working with and developing young people what is the time commitment the commitment is as much as you want to make it but clearly there are responsibilities that go along with being in charge of cadets and if you dont turn up they dont get the chance to train most detachments meet twice a week there are frequent weekends away and you will be expected to attend the annual camp which is two weeks outdoor activity usually in the summer months can i gain any qualifications in the acf yes as well as in house qualifications the acf also offers the opportunity to gain widely recognised qualifications such as nvqs btecs and the duke of edinburghs award training its volunteers is part of the acfs core business and it is very aware of what it can add and makes sure it does add to the cvs of its adult instructors will i have to buy any uniform no all your uniform will be provided as will all the equipment you need to lead and train cadets are there any particular professions you are short of the acf is particularly keen to attract people who can bring the skills of their civilian life to benefit cadets such as chefs mechanics it and people with skills in management do i need to have some military background to become an adult instructor in the acf not at all acf adult instructors are youth workers first and foremost we can teach you all the
