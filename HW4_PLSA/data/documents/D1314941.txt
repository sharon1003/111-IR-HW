and links are provided as starting points for readers who must make up their own minds about how much security they need and whether particular offerings will suit their needs for information about the law and technology of government surveillance in the united states check out effs surveillance selfdefense project1 do not reveal personal information inadvertently you may be shedding personal details including email addresses and other contact information without even knowing it unless you properly configure your web browser in your browsers setup options or preferences menus you may wish to use a pseudonym instead of your real name and not enter an email address nor provide other personally identifiable information that you dont wish to share when visiting a site you trust you can choose to give them your info in forms on their site there is no need for your browser to potentially make this information available to all comers also be on the lookout for systemwide internet defaults programs on your computer some examples include windows internet control panel and mac oss configuration manager and the thirdparty mac utility named internet config while they are useful for various things like keeping multiple web browers and other internet tools consistent in how the treat downloaded files and such they should probably also be anonymized just like your browser itself if they contain any fields for personal information households with children may have an additional security problem  have you set clear rules for your kids so that they know not to reveal personal information unless you ok it on a sitebysite basis2 turn on cookie notices in your web browser andor use cookie management software or infomediaries cookies are tidbits of information that web sites store on your computer temporarily or moreorless permanently in many cases cookies are useful and inocuous they may be passwords and user ids so that you do not have to keep retyping them every time you load a new page at the site that issued the cookie other cookies however can be used for data mining purposes to track your motions through a web site the time you spend there what links you click on and other details that the company wants to record usually for marketing purposes most cookies can only be read by the party that created them however some companies that manage online banner advertising are in essence cookie sharing rings they can track which pages you load which ads you click on etc and share this information with all of their client web sites who may number in the hundreds even thousands some examples of these cookie sharing rings are double click ad cast and link exchange for a demonstration of how they work see httpprivacynettrackbrowsers are starting to allow user control over cookies netscape for example allows you to see a notice when a site tries to write a cookie file to your hard drive and gives you some information about it allowing you to decide whether or not to accept it be on the lookout for cookies the function of which is not apparent which go to other sites than the one you are trying to load or which are not temporary it also allows you to automatically block all cookies that are being sent to third parties or to block all cookies entirely but this will make some sites inoperable internet explorer has a cookie management interface in addition to netscapelike features allowing you to selectively enable or disable cookies on a sitebysite basis even to allow cookies for a site generally but delete a specific cookie you are suspicious about with internet explorer you can also turn on cookies for a site temporarily then disable them when you no longer need them eg at an online bookstore that requires cookies to process an order but whom you dont want to track what books you are looking at what links you are following etc the rest of the time turning on cookie warnings will cause alert boxes to pop up but after some practice you may learn to hit decline so fast that you hardly notice them any more the idea is to only enable cookies on sites that require them and whom you trust you may also wish to try out alternative browsers like mozilla windows mac linux opera windows mac linux konqueror linux and i cab mac which may offer better cookie management you can also use cookie management software and services one example is the internet junkbuster proxy  httpwwwjunkbusterscomhtenijbhtml  it runs on win9598nt and unixlinux no mac version and can selectively block cookies for you and banner ads to boot inter mute  httpwwwintermutecom does likewise and more  blocks popup windows etc  only runs under windows another windowsonly solution is ad subtract  httpwwwadsubtractcom  a comparable product linux solaris windows is guide scope  httpwwwguidescopecomhome a javabased solution called muffin  httpmuffindoitorg  is also available while it will run on mac windows and unix systems it is definitely for power users as it is complicated to set up and operate effectively another recent option linux mac windows is the  httpwwwwebwashercom  which has advanced cookie filtering capabilities especially with the secludeit and secretmaker plugins available at the same site one more windows is cookie pal  httpwwwkburracomcpalhtml  and yet another windows is  httpwwwthelimitsoftcomcookiehtml  there are also numerous cookie eater applications some which run on a schedule or in the background that delete cookie files for you as with turning off cookies entirely you may have trouble accessing sites that require certain cookies though in most cases the worst that will happen is that youll have to reenter a login id and password you thought were saved eating the cookies periodically still permits sites to track what youre doing for a short time ie the time between successive deletion of your cookie file but thwarts attempts to discern and record your actions over time yet another option is to use an infomediary some are homeuse software products others may be networkbased services such as seige softs siege surfer  httpwwwsiegesoftcomhtmltutorialasp  zero knowledge systems freedom  httpwwwfreedomnet  among others these productsservices act as a proxy or shield between you and sites you visit and can completely disguise to web sites where you are coming from and who you are and intercept all cookies most are windowsonly at this point though orangatango  httpwwworangatangocom  and safe weband  httpwwwsafewebcom  also offer such services that are webbased and not platformdependent warning do not confuse honest infomediaries with identity managmenet services like microsofts passport service or novells digital me while you may gain some temporary convenience at sites that support them youll lose essential privacy because these services are not there to serve you but to serve marketing purposes by collecting a vast array of information about you and selling it the best solution doesnt exist yet full cookie management abilities built into the browsers themselves only increased user pressure on microsoft netscape and other browser makers can make this happen users should ultimately be able to reject cookies on a wholedomain basis reject all thirdparty cookies by default reject all cookies that are not essential for the transaction at hand receive notice of exactly what a cookie is intended for and be able to set default behaviors and permissions rather than have to interact with cookies on a pagebypage basis this just isnt possible yet you may wish to contact the company that makes your browser software and demand these essential features in the next version3 keep a clean email address when mailing to unknown parties posting to newsgroups mailing lists chat rooms and other public spaces on the net or publishing a web page that mentions your email address it is best to do this from a side account some pseudonymous or simply alternate address and to use your main or preferred address only on small membersonly lists and with known trusted individuals addresses that are posted even as part of message headers in public spaces can be easily discovered by spammers online junk mailers and added to their list of targets if your public throw away address gets spammed enough to become annoying you can simply kill it off and start a new one your friends boss etc will still know your real address you can use a free advertisingsupported email service provider like yahoo mail or hotmail for such side accounts it is best to use a real internet service provider for your main account and to examine their privacy policies and terms of service as some freemail services may have poor privacy track records you may find it works best to use an email package that allows mulitiple user ids and addresses aka personalities aliases so that you do not have to switch between multiple programs to manange and use more than one email address though you may have to use a web browser rather than an email program to read your mail in your throw away accounts  many freemail providers do not allow pop or imap connections if you are required to give an email address to use a site but will not be required to check your mail for some kind of access code they send you you can use someuserexamplecom examplecom is a nonexistent site set up by the internet standards to be used as an example that will never accidentally coincide with anyones real email address which is always a danger if you just make up one off the top of your head 4 dont reveal personal details to strangers or justmet friends the speed of internet communication is oftenmirroredin rapid online acquaintanceships and friendships but it is important to realize that you dont really know who these people are or what they are like in real life a thousand miles away you dont have friendsoffriends or other references about this person be also wary of facetoface meetings if you and your new efriend wish to meet in person do it in a public place bringing a friend along can also be a good idea one neednt be paranoid but one should not be an easy mark either some personal information you might wish to withhold until you know someone much better would include your full name place of employment phone number and street address among more obvious things like credit card numbers etc needless to say such information should not be put on personal home pages if you have a work home page it may well have work contact information on it but you neednt reveal this page to everyone you meet in a chat room for this and other reasons many people maintain two personal home pages a workrelated one and an off duty version in the commercial sector too beware fastmet friends a commonsocial engineeringform of industrial espionage is to befriend someone online just long enough to get them to reveal insider information5 realize you may be monitored at work avoid sending highly personal email to mailing lists and keep sensitive files on your home computer in most us states and many if not most countries employees have little if any privacy protection from monitoring by employers when discussing sensitive matters in email or other online media be certainwith whom you are communicating if you replied to a mailing list post check the headers  is your reply going to the person you think it is or to the whole list also be aware that an increasing number of employers are monitoring and recording employee web usage as well as email this could compromise home banking passwords and other sensitive information keep private data and private net usageprivate at home see this cnn  idg article on snoopware which may not be limited to your officehttpwwwcnncom2001techptech1107snoopwareidg6 beware sites that offer some sort of reward or prize in exchange for yourcontact information or other personal details theres a very high probability that they are gathering this information for direct marketing purposes in many cases your name and address are worth much more to them because they can sell it to other marketers who can do the same in turn than what you are supposedly getting from them be especially wary of sweepstakes and contests you probably wont win but the marketer sure will if you give them your information7 do not reply to spammers for any reason spam or unsolicited bulk email is something you are probably already familiar with and tired of if you get a spammed advertisment certainly dont take the sender up on whatever offer they are making but also dont bother replying with remove in the subject line or whatever probably bogus unsubscribe instructions youve been given this simply confirms that your address is being read by a real person and youll find yourself on dozens more spammers lists in no time if you open the message watch your outgoing mail queue to make sure that a return receipt message was not generated to be sent back to the spammer automatically it is best to queue your mail and send manually rather than send immediately so that you can see whats about to go out before its actually sent you should also turn off your mailers automatic honoring of return receipt requests if any if you have a good internet service provider you may be able to forward copies of spam email to the system administrators who can route a complaint to the isp of the spammer or if you know a lot about mail headers and dns tools you can probably contact these isps yourself to complain about the spammer if you are getting spammed a lot there are a variety of filters and antispam services available including spam hater  httpwwwcixcouknetservicesspamspamhaterhtm  for windows userstag  httpalcorconcordiacatopicsemailautoprocmailspam  for experienced unix users spam bouncer  httpwwwspambouncerorg  for experienced unix users works well with tagbright mail  httpwwwbrightmailcom  for isps spam cop  httpspamcopnet  for anyone more information on fighting spam is available at elsops antispam page  httpwwwelsopcomwrcnospamhtm  maximum downforces infonlinks page  httpwwwmaximumdownforcecomhotlinkshtml whews antispam campaign  httpwwwwhewcomspammers  many of these are difficult to use for novices and some require unix expertise others are services that deal with isps only not end users8 be conscious of web security never submit a credit card number or other highly sensitive personal information without first making sure your connection is secure encrypted in netscape look for an closed lock windows or unbroken key mac icon at the bottom of the browser window in internet explorer look for a closed lock icon at the bottom windows or near the top mac of the browser window in any browser look at the url web address line  a secure connection will begin https intead of http if you are at page that asks for such information but shows http try adding the s yourself and hitting enter to reload the page for netscape or ie in another browser use whatever method is required by your browser to reload the page at the new url if you get an error message that the page or site does not exist this probably means that the company is so clueless  and careless with your information and your money  that they dont even have web security take your business elsewhere your browser itself gives away information about you if your ip address can be tied to your identity this is most commonly true of dsl and broadband users rather than modem users who are a dwindling minority for a demo of how much detail is automatically given out about your system by your browser see httpprivacynetanalyze  also be on the lookout for spyware  software that may be included with applications you install games utilities whatever the purpose of which is to silently spy on your online habits and other details and report it back to the company whose product you are using one ms windows solution for disabling spyware is the adaware program shareware from httpwwwlavasoftde  which can remove spyware from your computer it is based on a large collaboratively maintained database of information about spyware linux and mac products of this sort are likely to appear soon java javascript and active x can also be used for spyware purposes support for these scripting languages can be disabled in your browsers configuration options aka preferences settings or properties it is safest to surf with them turned off and only turn them on when a site you trust and want to use requires them if you dont know if your browser supports these languages or dont know if they are turned on you can use browser spy to find out along with a lot of other information about your web browsing software httpgemaldkbrowserspyanother form of spyware consists of webbugs which typically manifest themselves as invisible or nearly invisible image files tied to cookies and javascripts that track your web usage see httpwwwgooglecomsearchhlenqwebbugs22webbugs22 for more information on webbugs see also this webbug faq httpwwwnthelpcomoetestwebbugfaqhtm for more details dealing with webbugs when they are embedded in an otherwise legitimate page is thorny as there isnt a surefire way to distinguish between webbugs and runofthemill image files but see the privacy foundations bugnosis webbug detector  httpwwwbugnosisorg  windows msie only when webbugs are loaded into popup pages the solution is to close the popups usually a small page with an ad though some of them are micropages that you can barely see a few may even use javascript tricks to keep you from closing them if this happens close all other browser windows then you should be able to close the bug window another tip for defeating webbugs is to reject any cookies from doubleclick ad cast link exchange and other ad exchange networks cookie sharing rings and any other cookies that are not from the site you are currently visiting most thirdparty cookies are basically webbugs lastly on this topic be aware that htmlcapable email programs and usenet newsreaders make webbugs work in your email and newsgroups if your mailer or newsreader has an option to turn off cookie support you should certainly do so there is hardly any imaginable legitimate use for a cookie in an email or a newsgroup posting9 be conscious of home computer security on the other side of the coin your own computer may be a trouble spot for internet security if you have a dsl line broadband cable modem or other connection to the internet that is up and running 24 hours including t1 at the office without a firewall or natunlike a modemandphoneline connection be sure to turn your computer off when you are not using it most home pcs have pitifully poor security compared to the unix workstations that power most commercial web sites system crackers search for vulnerable unattended dslconnected home computers and can invade them with surprising ease rifiling through files looking for credit card numbers or other sensitive data or even taking over the computer and quietly using it for their own purposes such as lauching attacks on other computers elsewhere  attacks you could initially be blamed for firewall hardware and software is another option that can protect you from these kinds of attacks available at any computer store freeware and shareware implementations may be available at sites like httpwwwsharewarecom or httpwwwdownloadcom10 examine privacy policies and seals when you are considering whether or not to do business with a web site there are other factors than a secure connection you have to consider that are equally important to web security does the site provide offline contact information including a postal address does the site have a prominentlyposted privacy policy if so what does it say just because they call it a privacy policy doesnt mean it will protect you  read it for yourself many are little more than disclaimers saying that you have no privacy so read them carefully if the policy sounds ok to you do you have a reason to believe it have you ever heard of this company what is their reputation and are they backing up their privacy statement with a seal program such as truste httpwwwtrusteorg or bbbonline httpwwwbbbonlineorg while imperfect such programs hold web sites to at least some minimal baseline standards and may revoke with much fanfare the approvalseal licenses of badacting companies that do not keep their word if you see a seal is it real check with the sealissuing site to make sure the seal isnt a fake and examine terms carefully especially if you are subscribing to a service rather than buying a product look out for autorebilling scams and hidden fees11 remember that you decide what information about yourself to reveal when why and to whom dont give out personallyidentifiable information too easily just as you might think twice about giving some clerk at the mall your home address and phone number keep in mind that simply because a site asks for or demands personal information from you does not mean you have to give it you do have to give accurate billing information if you are buying something of course but if you are registering with a free site that is a little too nosy for you there is no law in most places against providing them with pseudonymous information however it would probably be polite to use obviously fake addresses such as 123 no such street nowhere dc 01010 if they are generating mailings based on this information  presumably in accordance with the terms of their privacy policy  they can probably weed such addresses out and not waste the postage on them definitely do not use someone elses real address however if you are required to agree to terms of service before using the free service be sure those terms do not include a requirement that you provide correct information unless the penalty is simply not being allowed to use the service any more and youre willing to pay that price if they figure out you are not providing them with your actual personallyidentifiable information12 use encryptionlast but certainly not least there are other privacy threats besides abusive marketers nosy bosses spammers and scammers some of the threats include industrial espionage government surveillance identity theft disgruntled former associates and system crackers relatively easytouse email and file encryption software is available for free such as pretty good privacy pgp available at httpwwwpgpiorg  which runs on almost all computers and even integrates seamlessly with most major email software good encryption uses very robust secret codes that are difficult if not impossible to crack to protect your data you can also use specialized services some free some pay that go beyond infomediary services including running all connections through a securely encrypted tunnel anonymous dialup even anonymous web publishing another type of product is ssh tunnelling port forwarding packages such as fsecure ssh  httpwwwfsecurecomproductsssh  and secure crt  httpwwwvandykecomproductssecurecrt  hopefully some day soon good encryption and computer security will simply be included in all isp services and operating systems but for now you have to actively seek out good service providers and addon products for more information on protecting your online privacy eff privacy archive  httpwwwefforgprivacyprotecting yourself online book
