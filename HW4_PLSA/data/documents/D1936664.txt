jan 11independent educational evaluations it’s a testy businessby steve c imber ph d and candace cortiella special education advisor blog add commentsby jess q what is an iee a the language regarding iees is found in the regulations implementing idea specifically the right to an iee is defined as“a parent has the right to an independent educational evaluation at the public expense if the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the public agency however the public agency may initiate a hearing under reg 300506 of this subpart to show that its evaluation is appropriate if the final decision is that the evaluation is appropriate the parent still has the right to an independent educational evaluation but not at the public expense” 34 cfr part 300503 b“whenever an independent evaluation is at the public expense the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained including the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner must be the same as the criteria which the public agency uses when it initiates an evaluation” 34 cfr 300503 eq why would a parent wish to obtain an iee a several reasons that parents often seek to obtain an iee include a belief that their child has an undiagnosed disability or conversely that their child does not have a disability a belief that the school’s evaluation was inadequate lacks thoroughness disagreement about such issues aswhether a child should continue to receive special education servicesthe specific nature of the disability such as other health impaired v emotional disturbancethe type of services offered such as inclusion v selfcontainedthe qualifications of the school’s evaluators such as experience with evaluating a particular disability such as asperger syndromea child’s present level of performance andor annual goalsthe relative progress accomplished toward the goals q what can an iee include a an iee can include an evaluation of educational testing psychological testing a social history a speech and language evaluation an occupational therapy evaluation a physical therapy evaluation andor a functional behavioral assessment when the child’s areas of suspected ability call for such evaluations q who chooses the evaluator to conduct an iee a a parent can request information from the district about where an iee may be obtained districts may provide parents with a list of qualified evaluators so long as the list is responsive to the childs needs and the list is exhaustive osep letters fields 1989 thorne 1990 rambo 1990 imber 1992 when a district fails to list all qualified evaluators within a given geographic area the parent may choose qualified evaluators who are not listed a district has the right to insure that independent evaluators are minimally as qualified as its own evaluators for example if a district only employs masters level special educators to conduct educational evaluators it could refuse to pay for a an iee if the independent evaluator had completed only a bachelors degree in special education q can school districts limit the cost of an iee a a district can establish policies for reasonable cost requirements based upon maximum allowable charges for specific tests however the determination of fees cannot merely be a simple averaging of usual fees charged in the area by professionals who are qualified to perform the testing nor can the determination of cost be used to eliminate certain evaluators policies on fees can be used to limit unreasonably excessive costs osep letter to kirby 1989 q can school districts limit the timeframe to obtain an iee a the district also has the right to establish reasonable time limits when an iee may be obtained at the public expense so if a parent wishes to obtain an iee at public expense more than two years after the district has completed its own evaluation the district might argue successfully that undue time has elapsed however special circumstances might mitigate that argument osep letter to thorne 1990 q can a state or school district impose policies that limit a parent’s unfettered right to an iee a states and districts can always include language in their regulations that provides more protection for children with disabilities and their parents usually their legal guardians than the federal regulations provide however states and school districts may not diminish the rights of children with disabilities and their parents as afforded through federal regulations for example during the 1980s the texas education agency tea developed a policy that permitted school districts to ascertain a parent’s disagreement with its evaluation and to then permit districts to correct shortcomings within the district’s evaluation prior to allowing a parent to obtain an iee the u s department of education’s office of special education programs osep instructed the tea to cease and desist imposing this policy as a precondition to an iee letters to gray 1988 kirby 1989 gramm 1990 tweet similarly when wisconsin imposed a policy restricting parents from obtaining an iee at public expense if the evaluator was not certified by its department of instruction did not have extensive experience working within public schools excluding independent evaluators who had testified on behalf of a child with disabilities in a due process hearing or who held a membership in an advocacy organization osep determined that such policies were unnecessarily restrictive letter to petska 2001 do …be sure to obtain review and understand your state and district

hearing is initiated by the district some districts may unreasonably delay authorizing for the payment of an iee parents may need the assistance of an advocate or an attorney who practices special education law in such cases feel that you need to provide the district with specific reasons why you are seeking an iee while districts can inquire about the nature of your disagreement it cannot unreasonably delay if the parents do not provide information about the nature with the disagreement with the district’s evaluation anticipate that the recommendations of an iee will be implemented by the school while the school must consider the results and recommendations of an iee the district is not required to utilize the information or adopt the recommendations steve c imber ph d is president
