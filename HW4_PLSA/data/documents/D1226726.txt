maskot  getty images convection ovens are the norm in most commercial kitchens and they are becoming popular in home kitchens but how does the home cook use this tool effectively what is a convection oven convection ovens may be gas or electric the difference between a convection oven and a traditional oven radial or thermal is that the convection oven has the added bonus of a fan the fan circulates the hot air resulting in more even cooking browning and crisping even browning makes food look and taste better and it keeps meats juicier baked products remain moist and get the most out of convection heating you will produce some of the best cakes bread pies and muffins to come out of your kitchen theres no need to rotate pans like cookie sheets halfway through the bake because of the even heat distribution unless you forget about them its hard to burn cookies or even get a crunchy bottom convection shortens cooking times by about 25 percent overall convection ovens offer a winwin situation for the best foods and the quickest cooking convection oven operation many current stove models have an optional convection feature this means that you can use the oven in the traditional manner or turn on the convection option at will the majority of recipes however are written with traditional ovens in mind tip all ovens vary so be sure to read the owners manual for your particular convection oven for traditional recipes cooking time is generally 25 percent less when cooking an uncovered recipe start checking for doneness about threequarters of the way through the recommended cooking time for example for a recipe that calls for a 40minute bake you should check it at 30 minutes if you dont want the hassle of trying to figure out the reduced cooking time simply reduce the oven temperature 25 f about 15 c and use the original cooking time of course this defeats the benefit of the faster cooking time but it takes less brainwork some convection ovens automatically reduce the temperature by 25 degrees for instance if you choose convection bake and set it to the 350 called for in the recipe the oven will adjust and warm to 325 f if you want a true 350 f you will need to set it to 375 and this allows you to bake at the quicker time again your owners manual is key to understanding the particular model you own your recipes in a convection oven if your recipe calls for covering the food such as casseroles or dutch oven dishes you will most likely need the traditional amount of baking time so no adjustment should be necessary if convection is optional on your oven its probably best to not even bother using it just use the conventional method center your baking vessel on the oven rack so air can circulate freely and evenly around the food shallow roasting pans or cookie sheets are recommended meat roasts and poultry should be placed on a vrack over a shallow pan when food is cooked uncovered in a convection oven it browns faster this does not necessarily mean it is done be sure to use a meat thermometer or the recommended testing method in the recipe instructions rather than going by outward appearances if you are using parchment paper in your pan you will most likely need to weight down the corners with pie weights so the fan doesnt blow the paper over the food silpat or silicone liners are recommended in lieu of parchment paper overall you will find that you prefer some foods on traditional bake and some on convection bake it will take some experimentation for your favorite dishes but once you get it you will be very happy this is the best part of having the option and why its worth looking into when shopping for a new oven
