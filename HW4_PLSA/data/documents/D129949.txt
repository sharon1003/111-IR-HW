gti trim lines the average savings for the 2018 volkswagen golf gti s dsg is 923 below the msrp our msrp includes the destination fee why does the true car manufacturers suggested retail price msrp not match the msrp found on most other websites we think most sites dont truly care about price and believe that not disclosing destination fees or shipping charges upfront creates confusion over hidden fees when at the dealership why else would many car manufacturer or leading research websites not include destination fee charges in the display of the msrp until youve indicated that you want to buy that car for us its simple because the destination charge is always found on the window sticker of a new car and is a fee that generally is not negotiable true car includes the value in the

reasonably priced read more updated on october 10 2016give me more performance options and not just 10 horsepowerwilliam » pa » 2016 volkswagen golf gti purchased april 2016  verified the gti is a well developed car that does almost everything very one could expect from a car that is at a price point which makes it a smart choice this car seems to be worth much more than its cost of entry and for that im glad it exists i would love to have had the means to purchase a porsche which i once did but i dont and so this makes the gti a purchase that gets me close albeit a little pedestrian in style having said that i am a substance over style purchaser so i am happy with my choice i would still want more power from this car without having to move up to the r give me more performance options and not just 10 horsepower dont get me wrong i really appreciate the other features offered in the sport package but could have liked a bump of 30 horsepower and 30 pound feet of torque to go with it at this point ill have to upgrade with a chip to achieve this level of performance all things being equal though i love the mk 7 with pp and lp i did change out the poor oem tires on purchase
