disinfection byproducts in drinking water is inconsistent objectives we assessed longterm exposure to trihalomethanes thms the most prevalent group of chlorination byproducts to evaluate the association with colorectal cancer methods a multicenter case–control study was conducted in spain and italy in 2008–2013 hospitalbased incident cases and populationbased spain and hospitalbased italy controls were interviewed to ascertain residential histories type of water consumed in each residence frequency and duration of showeringbathing and major recognized risk factors for colorectal cancer we estimated adjusted odds ratios or for colorectal cancer in association with quartiles of estimated average lifetime thm concentrations in each participant’s residential tap water microgramsliter from age 18 to 2 years before the interview and estimated average lifetime thm ingestion from drinking residential tap water microgramsday results we analyzed 2047 cases and 3718 controls median values ranges for average lifetime residential tap water concentrations of total thms chloroform and brominated thms were 30 0–174 17 0–63 and 9 0–145 μgl respectively total thm concentration in residential tap water was not associated with colorectal cancer or  092 95 ci 066 128 for highest vs lowest quartile but chloroform concentrations were inversely associated or  031 95 ci 024 041 for highest vs lowest quartile brominated thm concentrations showed a positive association among men in the highest versus the lowest quartile or  143 95 ci 083 246 patterns of association were similar for estimated average thm ingestion through residential water consumption conclusions we did not find clear evidence of an association between detailed estimates of lifetime total thm exposure and colorectal cancer in our large case–control study population negative associations with chloroform concentrations and ingestion suggest differences among specific thms but these findings should be confirmed in other study populations introduction colorectal cancer represents nearly 10 of global cancer incidence with increasing rates over the last decades  bosman et al 2014  intake of total energy red and processed meat and alcoholic drinks together with physical inactivity body fat abdominal fat and adultattained height are established risk factors  bosman et al 2014 world cancer research fund wcrf and american institute for cancer research aicr et al 2011  suggested protective factors include consumption of dietary fiber and high fruit and vegetable consumption  wcrf and aicr et al 2011 bradbury et al 2014  among others however part of the burden of disease remains unexplained by the abovementioned risk factors human and animal studies suggest that carcinogens in drinking water may be associated with colorectal cancer risk  rahman et al 2010  disinfection byproducts dbps are chemicals resulting from disinfection processes that are widespread in drinking water trihalomethanes thms are among the most prevalent dbps and are highly volatile and skin permeable exposure occurs through inhalation dermal absorption and ingestion  ashley et al 2005 gordon et al 2006  the four thms in drinking water that are regulated in the united states european union and other countries are chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform these chemicals display different physicochemical and toxicological properties chloroform is highly volatile whereas the other three compounds from now on referred to as brominated thms are more lipophilic and genotoxic  plewa et al 2008  metabolism of dbps is mediated by enzymes from the cytochrome p450 cyp and glutathione s transferase gst families in a hospitalbased case–control study polymorphisms in cyp2e1 gstt1 and gstz1 were found to modify associations between bladder cancer and dbp exposure  cantor et al 2010  animal studies have suggested an association between dbp exposure and colorectal cancer preneoplastic lesions have been produced in the intestines of rodents administered dbps via drinking water in chronic bioassays  de angelo et al 2002 mc dorman et al 2003  however some studies have shown that chloroform may inhibit gastrointestinal carcinogenecity in rodents  daniel et al 1989 1991  human epidemiological evidence is mixed case–control  bove et al 2007 cragle et al 1985 hildesheim et al 1998 king et al 2000 young et al 1987 and cohort  doyle et al 1997 koivusalo et al 1997 studies including incident cases of colorectal cancer and quantitative estimates of exposure to dbps such as trihalomethanes or related surrogates have produced contradictory results see table s1 three studies reported positive associations with colon cancer  cragle et al 1985 doyle et al 1997 king et al 2000  and three studies reported null associations  hildesheim et al 1998 koivusalo et al 1997 young et al 1987  similarly two studies reported positive associations with rectal cancer  bove et al 2007 hildesheim et al 1998  and three reported null associations  doyle et al 1997 king et al 2000 koivusalo et al 1997  the exposure assessments differed with five studies evaluating thms  bove et al 2007 doyle et al 1997 hildesheim et al 1998 king et al 2000 young et al 1987 and one each evaluating years living in households with chlorinated water  cragle et al 1985 and water mutagenicity  koivusalo et al 1997  the inconsistency of human epidemiological evidence might be partly attributable to exposure misclassification including a lack of evaluation of different routes of exposure and uncontrolled confounders here we examined the association between thm exposure and colorectal cancer in a large multicenter case–control study considering specific thm components and exposure activities involving dermal contact inhalation and ingestion methods study design and population spain we conducted a multicase–control study from september 2007 to november 2013 in nine provinces of spain mccspain project including colorectal prostate breast and gastroesophageal cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases and a common pool of populationbased controls  castañovinyals et al 2015  cases included in the present analysis were histologically confirmed incident colorectal cancer patients  international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems 10th revision icd10 c18 c19 c20 d010 d011 d012 cases were interviewed as soon as possible after diagnosis median of 58 days and were identified through active searches including periodic visits to hospital departments ie gastroenterology oncology general surgery radiotherapy and pathology minimal losses occurred from cases dying before being contacted 05 of potentially eligible cases controls were frequency matched to cases by sex age ± 5 years and area of residence ensuring that in each area there was at least one control of the same sex and 5year interval for each case controls were selected from the general population in each study area and were identified from the lists of randomly selected family practitioners in primary assistance centers sharing the catchment area of the participating hospital this procedure ensured the identification of controls from the general population and from the same study base as cases through the social security records health coverage is universal in spain with the advantage that the telephone contacts by the study personnel on behalf of the family practitioner increased the response rate compared with other procedures  castañovinyals et al 2011  for each control needed five potential participants of similar age sex and hospital catchment area were randomly selected from the general practitioner lists if contact was not made with the first person on the list after five tries at different times of day or if heshe refused to participate the next person on the list was approached  castañovinyals et al 2011  the frequency matching was done separately for each study area considering the age and sex distribution of the total number of cases recruited thus the final number of controls in the present analysis is greater than the number of cases because the controls were matched to different cancer sites italy we conducted a case–control study of colorectal cancer in three provinces of italy milan pordenone udine between january 2008 and july 2010 hiwate project  nieuwenhuijsen et al 2009  cases were histologically confirmed incident colorectal cancer patients icd10 c18 c19 c20 who were interviewed as soon as possible after diagnosis median of 28 days and were identified through active searches including periodic visits to hospital departments ie gastroenterology oncology general surgery radiotherapy and pathology controls were frequency matched to cases by sex age ± 5 years and area of residence with a casecontrol ratio of 1 controls were identified from patients admitted to the same network of hospitals as cases for a wide spectrum of acute nonneoplastic conditions unrelated to tobacco and alcohol consumption longterm diet modification and other factors likely related to colorectal cancer overall 52 of controls had acute surgical conditions 15 had orthopedic disorders 12 had dental ear nose and throat diseases and 21 had miscellaneous other conditions in both countries study participants were 20–85 years old had resided in the hospital catchment area for ≥ 6 months before recruitment and were able to answer the epidemiological questionnaire participant hospitals 17 in spain 10 in italy were the reference centers for oncologic diseases in each study area the study protocol was approved by the ethics review boards of the participating centers and all participants signed an informed consent before recruitment data collection and response rates trained interviewers administered questionnaires to collect personal information on sociodemographic factors lifestyle smoking alcohol consumption physical activity etc  anthropometrics height weight residential history type of water consumed in each residence municipal bottled other frequency of showering bathing and hand dishwashing occupation medication medical history and family history of cancer amount of water ingested was ascertained as the number of glasses per day consumed on average by an adult at home at the workplace and in other places bottled water municipal water water from other sources coffee tea and herbal drinks were considered separately a final section evaluating the quality of the interview was completed by the interviewer dietary habits were collected through semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires that were selfadministered in spain and administered by an interviewer in italy sample size was fixed by the primary scientific objectives of the mccspain study  castañovinyals et al 2015  before any analysis we used data from the literature on total thm distribution  villanueva et al 2012 to calculate using the program granmo 712  marrugat et al 1998  that the statistical power was 100 assuming a difference of 4 μgl between cases and controls based on current preliminary data and accepting an alpha risk of 005 in a twosided contrast response rates were calculated as follows subjects interviewed were in the numerator and all subjects including refusals were in the denominator the average response rates were 68 in spain and 95 in italy among cases and 53 in spain and 95 in italy among controls in total 2371 cases 1905 in spain 466 in italy and 4159 controls 3590 in spain 569 in italy were interviewed trihalomethane levels in the study areas we used trihalomethanes as a surrogate of dbps we collected routine thm measurements chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform and historical information on water sources surfaceground proportion and treatment in the drinking water supplied to the study areas back to 1940 through a structured questionnaire aimed at water utilities and local and health authorities routine monitoring data were provided by the sinac sistema de información nacional en aguas de consumo in spain 2004–2010 and by the regional environmental health agency milan and the local health authority pordenoneudine in italy availability of thm measurements differed among study areas with the longest record starting in 1979 in total 275 water zones in spain and 370 in italy were included estimation of longterm trihalomethane levels in drinking water annual average levels were calculated for the four thms separately at the water zone level that is to say at the minimum geographic unit with homogeneous water source treatment and quality corresponding to municipality in most cases cases and controls lived on average in three residences during the exposure window therefore cases and controls from an area had different and multiple water zones assigned years without measurements were assigned the average of all available measurements in the water zone if the water source and treatment did not change over the years trihalomethane concentrations in surface water are usually higher than in ground sources  villanueva et al 2003  and we used surface water percentage as a weight to backextrapolate thm concentrations when water sources changed assuming that concentrations increased proportionately to the percentage of surface water the same assumptions were used for the four thms and were applied uniformly in all water zones hypochlorite was the main disinfectant used in all of the study areas alternative or complementary treatments identified in the study areas included permanganate chlorine dioxide and ozonation water zones with thm measurements and changes in treatment over the years were used to estimate the change percentage in the four thms separately after introducing such treatments these percentages were applied as a weight to backextrapolate concentrations of the four thms separately in areas with changes in these specific treatments for years when measurements were unavailable before chlorination started thm concentrations were assumed to be zero the years when chlorination started varied widely among study areas ranging from before 1940 asturias barcelona cantabria to 2005 a small municipality in valencia using these procedures we estimated annual average thm levels by water zone back to 1940 in areas covering 83 of study personyears ranging from 67 león to 95 gipuzkoa individual exposures in the study population average thm concentrations in residential tap water trihalomethane concentrations microgramsliter considering the four thms separately and subjects’ personal data were linked by year and water zone of residence to obtain annual concentrations in the residences where subjects lived from age 18 to 2 years before the interview henceforth referred to as “lifetime” the average concentration in all residences with thm estimates was then calculated average thm ingestion the average thm ingestion microgramsday was estimated by calculating the average residential thm concentration assuming a zero level in residences consuming bottled water based on a report by fontribera et al 2010 and 03 03 08 and 18 μgl for chloroforom bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform respectively in residences consuming private well water these wellwater values were averages of 56 observations from water zones with chlorinated ground water in different areas gipuzkoa barcelona valencia and navarra because we assumed that private well water was likely to be chlorinated municipal thm concentration was assigned to the years living in residences with municipal water consumption we averaged the thm concentration calculated using this procedure in residences from age 18 to 2 years before the interview and multiplied by the amount of water consumed at home litersday assuming 200 m lglass we used total water consumed at the residence municipal bottled private well because we did not have the specific amount by residence and these habits may have changed over a participant’s life showering and bathing thm exposure we evaluated thm exposure through showering and bathing microgramsliter × minutesday in terms of the average duration of showers and baths minutesweek and the average thm concentration in residential tap water genotyping blood or saliva samples were collected in all spanish areas for dna analysis the response rate among those included in the present analysis was 93 and dna was obtained from 3579 blood and 926 saliva samples owing to budget restrictions genotyping was performed in a random sample of subjects except in the murcia area where genotyping was not conducted covering 71 of the spanish participants genomewide genotyping was performed using a customized version of the infinium human exome bead chip kit v11 illumina a total of 5363 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps of interest to the mcc study were added to the chip for a total of 248264 markers the genotype calling was performed using the gen train 20 algorithm genome studio

and composition of trihalomethanes differed between study areas  figure 1  the median concentrations overall were 295 174 and 90 μgl for residential total thms chloroform and brominated thms respectively area median concentration of total thms ranged from 1 μgl udinepordone italy to 86 μgl barcelona brominated thms were highest in murcia and barcelona with medians of 65 and 64 μgl respectively and chloroform was highest in madrid median 28 μgl differences in ingested thms among areas were less pronounced than concentrations of thms in drinking water because the areas with higher thm concentrations usually had higher proportions of bottled water consumption the spearman correlation coefficients between total thms versus chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform were 068 087 077 and 064 respectively between total brominated thms and bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform the spearman correlation coefficients were 096 098 and 090 respectively these correlations varied among study areas total thm–chloroform correlation was  084 in all areas except barcelona –032 the distribution densities of average

table s3 however a majority of cases 69 were colon cancers and the number of cases of rectal cancer were particularly small among women leading to imprecise estimates discussion we estimated longterm exposure to four trihalomethanes in drinking water in a large multicenter case–control study of colorectal cancer including areas with contrasting thm concentrations and evaluating different routes of exposure in accord with some experimental evidence chloroform concentrations were inversely associated with colorectal cancer in men and women a positive association with colorectal cancer was only identified in the highest exposure category of brominated thm concentrations among men similar associations were found for colon and rectal cancer analyzed separately evidence of dbp carcinogenicity

intestinal tract to the effects of mx on preneoplastic or neoplastic development despite the elevated mx genotoxicity observed in the gastrointestinal gi tract  steffensen et al 1999  specific evidence on gastrointestinal carcinogenicity has shown that chloroform inhibits chemically induced tumors  daniel et al 1989 and nuclear anomalies  daniel et al 1991 in rodents exposed to gi carcinogens more recently chloroform was identified as the active component of an herbal drug used to treat cancer  zhang et al 2014 yu et al 2007  and the chloroform fraction of a traditional drug used in asia has shown antitumor activity  habib and karim 2011  although the mechanisms are not known a possible explanation would involve selectively destroying the initiated cells  reddy et al 1992 through apoptosis and supression of proliferation  zhang et al 2014  finally the association with chloroform should be cautiously interpreted and remains to be confirmed approximately 11 of the study population had exposures above the maximum contaminant levels for total thms in spain 100 μgl the maximum concentration observed was 174 μgl and most of these high exposures were clustered in the area of barcelona 97 followed by murcia 3 in italy all study subjects were below the regulatory limits 30 μgl specific thms are not regulated in italy or in spain  diario oficial boletín oficial del estado boe 2003 gazzetta ufficiale della repubblica italiana guri 2001  the highest exposure categories defined in previous studies were ≥ 75 μgl  king et al 2000  ≥ 464 μgl  hildesheim et al 1998 and  40 μgl  young et al 1987  all of which were included in the range of our study the case–control study by bove et al 2007 which included only men showed a median chloroform concentration 176 μgl similar to our median concentration 17 μgl our exposure periods are comparable to those of previous studies which covered either lifetime  hildesheim et al 1998 young et al 1987 or 40 years before the interview  king et al 2000  however the present study evaluated populations with higher concentrations of brominated thms than did previous case–control or cohort studies evaluating colorectal cancer only one case–control study evaluated associations for brominated thms  bove et al 2007  and it showed positive associations with rectal cancer our results are not consistent with those of a cohort study conducted by doyle et al 1997 in which the predominant thm was chloroform geometric mean 461 μgl in surface water 82 from total thms and associations were estimated for this substance they reported a positive association for colon cancer relative risk rr  168 95 ci 111 253 and a null association for rectal cancer rr  107 95 ci 060 193 for the highest exposure category 14–287 μgl to our knowledge this is the first epidemiological study reporting a negative association with chloroform however king et al 2000 reported negative associations for some categories of total thm exposure among women without a clear dose–response our findings showing different associations for specific thms lead us to speculate that the use of total thms without considering different dbp compositions could at least partly explain the heterogeneous results obtained in previous studies finally the gut microbiota may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis because chlorinated water has been shown to alter the enteric environment in mice  sasada et al 2015  this finding has received recent attention and evidence is limited whereas negative associations with chloroform were found for both men and women a positive association with brominated and total thms was found among men at the high end of the exposure range where there are few observations and precision is low similarly previous studies have found inconsistent differences between men and women regarding colorectal cancer associated with thm exposure  king et al 2000  although associations were minimally modified by introducing covariables in the models data not shown residual confounding cannot be ruled out exposure measurement error is a concern in cancer studies given the long exposure windows and limited historical thm measurements in the present study we applied different strategies to minimize measurement error for the exposures subjects included in the models had exposure estimates covering a major portion of the exposure window ≥ 70 because the quality of the interview is related to measurement error  villanueva et al 2009  we only analyzed subjects with reliable interviews finally inability to account for thm exposure outside the home may have introduced error in the ingestion estimates for thms although most of the total water consumption occurred at home 74 we cannot rule out uncontrolled confounding by other water contaminants however longterm assessment of exposure to nitrate has been conducted following methods comparable to those used for trihalomethane exposure assessment  espejoherrera et al 2016  lifetime average nitrate concentrations in the residence ranged approximately from 3 to 20 mgl and pearson correlation coefficients between longterm nitrate and thm concentrations were 003 range –076 to 045 for total thms –041 range –056 to 032 for chloroform and 015 –072 to 056 for brominated thms overall minimum–maximum per area to explore potential confounding by nitrate we adjusted our main model additionally for nitrate the point estimates varied minimally data not shown ruling out a major confounding effect of nitrate selection bias might be a concern particularly in spain where response rates were lower than those in italy the high response rate in italy reflects traditionally high compliance of subjects approached for interview in the study’s hospitalbased case–control network in addition controls were populationbased in spain but hospitalbased in italy explaining the lower response rates among controls in spain however we assume that the probability of participation is independent from the exposure and we do not expect an impact on the results from response rates study participants in spain are part of a larger study in which a common pool of controls is shared for different cancer sites colorectal breast prostate stomach lymphocytic chronic leukemia leading to a larger number of controls than of cases and to slightly different age and sex distributions metabolism of dbps is mediated by enzymes from the gst and cyp families  de marini et al 1997 pegram et al 1997 raucy et al 1993  in a previous study we examined interactions between thm exposure and polymorphisms in two of the three genes that modified associations between thms and bladder cancer  cantor et al 2010  we found associations with polymorphisms in cyp2e1 that were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons we did not find indications that polymorphisms in gstz modified the effects of exposure to brominated thms although we evaluated gene–environment interactions in a large study the analysis was limited by dichotomization of exposure and our power to detect modest interactions after controlling for multiple comparisons remains limited conclusions associations with colorectal cancer differed for estimated exposures to chloroform versus brominated thms in residential drinking water in our case–control study our findings suggest a protective effect of chloroform whereas a positive association with brominated thms was observed among men at the extreme tail of the exposure distribution where the results may have been driven by a small number of observations overall these results require confirmation references ashley dl blount bc singer pc depaz e wilkes c gordon s et al 2005 changes in blood trihalomethane concentrations resulting
