elements the roman baths in bath the water which bubbles up from the ground at bath falls as rain on the nearby mendip hills it percolates down through limestone aquifers to a depth of between 2700 and 4300 metres 8900 and 14100 ft where geothermal energy raises the water temperature to between 69 and 96 °c 1562 and 2048 °f under pressure the heated water rises to the surface along fissures and faults in the limestone this process is similar to an artificial one known as enhanced geothermal system which also makes use of the high pressures and temperatures below the earths crust hot water at a temperature of 46 °c 1148 °f rises here at the rate of 1170000 litres 257364 imp gal every day 2 from a geological fault the pennyquick fault in 1983 a new spa water borehole was sunk providing a clean and safe supply of spa water for drinking in the pump room 3history  editthe statue of king bladud overlooking the kings bath carries the date of 1699 but its inclusion in earlier pictures shows that it is much older than this 4the first shrine at the site of the hot springs was built by celts 5 and was dedicated to the goddess sulis whom the romans identified with minerva geoffrey of monmouth in his largely fictional historia regum britanniae describes how in 836 bc the spring was discovered by the british king bladud who built the first moorish baths 6 early in the 18th century geoffreys obscure legend was given great prominence as a royal endorsement of the waters qualities with the embellishment that the spring had cured bladud and his herd of pigs of leprosy through wallowing in the warm mud 7how the romans used the building  editthe name sulis continued to be used after the roman invasion leading to the towns roman name of aquae sulis the waters of sulis the temple was constructed in 60–70 ad and the bathing complex was gradually built up over the next 300 years 8 during the roman occupation of britain and possibly on the instructions of emperor claudius 9 engineers drove oak piles to provide a stable foundation into the mud and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead in the 2nd century it was enclosed within a wooden barrelvaulted building 5 and included the caldarium hot bath tepidarium lukewarm bath and frigidarium cold bath 10 after the roman withdrawal from britain in the first decade of the 5th century these fell into disrepair and were eventually lost due to silting up 11 and flooding 12 the anglosaxon chronicle suggests the original roman baths were destroyed in the 6th century 13about 130 curse tablets have been found many of the curses related to thefts of clothes whilst the victim was bathing 14redevelopment  editthe great bath — the entire structure above the level of the pillar bases is a later construction the baths have been modified on several occasions including the 12th century when john of tours built a curative bath over the kings spring reservoir and the 16th century when the city corporation built a new bath queens bath to the south of the spring 15 the spring is now housed in 18thcentury buildings designed by architects john wood the elder and john wood the younger father and son visitors drank the waters in the grand pump room a neoclassical salon which remains in use both for taking the waters and for social functions victorian expansion of the baths complex followed the neoclassical tradition established by the woods in 1810 the hot springs failed and william smith opened up the hot bath spring to the bottom where he found that the spring had not failed but had flowed into a new channel smith restored the water to its original course and the baths filled in less time than before 16the visitor entrance is via an 1897 concert hall by j m brydon it is an eastward continuation of the grand pump room with a glassdomed centre and singlestorey radiused corner 17 the grand pump room was begun in 1789 by thomas baldwin he resigned in 1791 and john palmer continued the scheme until its completion in 1799 15 the elevation on to abbey church yard has a centre piece of four engaged corinthian columns with entablatures and pediment it has been designated by historic england as a grade i listed building 18 the north colonnade was also designed by thomas baldwin 19 the south colonnade is similar but had an upper floor added in the late 19th century 20 the museum and queens bath including the bridge spanning york street to the city laundry were by charles edward davis in 1889 it comprises a southward extension to the grand pump room in which some remains of the c17 queens bath are merged 21museum  editthe museum houses artifacts from the roman period including objects that were thrown into the sacred spring presumably as offerings to the goddess these include more than 12000 roman currency coins which is the largest collective votive deposit known from britain 22 a gilt bronze head of the goddess sulis minerva which was discovered nearby in 1727 is displayed 23 an audio guide is available in 12 languages gorgons head from the temple pediment the bath roman temple stood on a podium more than two metres above the surrounding courtyard approached by a flight of steps on the approach there were four large fluted corinthian columns supporting a frieze and decorated pediment above the pediment parts of which are displayed in the museum is the triangular ornamental section 26 feet 79 m wide and 8 feet 24 m from the apex to the bottom 24 above the pillars on the front of the building it featured the powerful central image of the gorgon ’s head glowering down from a height of 15 metres 49 ft on all who approached the temple the great head itself has snakes entwined within its beard wings above its ears beetling brows and a heavy moustache 25 although there is some controversy about what this really represents as gorgons are usually female 26 an alternative interpretation sees the central head as the image of a water god such as oceanus 27 and yet another as a celtic sun god 10 in early 2010 various stones on the pediment were conserved and rearranged 28also on display are the remains of the elaborate hypocaust heating system which served the sweat rooms in 2016 planning permission was received for a new learning centre aimed at schoolchildren and linked to the baths by a tunnel funding is being sought from the heritage lottery fund and if successful it is hoped the centre will open in 2019 29 30conservation  editstatues on the terrace the late 19th century carvings of roman emperors and governors of roman britain on the terrace overlooking the great bath are particularly susceptible to the effect of acid rain and are being protected with a wash of a sacrificial shelter coat every few years 31 exhibits within the temple precincts are susceptible to warm air which had the effect of drawing corrosive salts out of the roman stonework to help reduce this a new ventilation system was installed in 2006 32in 2009 a grant of £90000 was made to bath and north east somerset council to contribute towards the cost of redeveloping displays and improving access to the roman baths 33 by the department for culture media and sport wolfson fund which was established to promote improvements in museums and galleries in england 34water safety  editbath was charged with responsibility for the hot springs in a royal charter of 1591 granted by elizabeth i this duty has now passed to bath and north east somerset council who carry out monitoring of pressure temperature and flow rates the thermal waters contain sodium calcium chloride and sulphate ions in high concentrations 35the water that flows through the roman baths is considered unsafe for bathing partly due to its having passed through the stillfunctioning original lead pipes and up until world war ii it was advertised on the basis of the radioactivity it contained however the more significant danger is now considered to be infectious diseases in october 1978 a young girl swimming with the bath dolphins a local swimming club in the restored roman bath contracted meningitis and died 36 leading to the closure of the bath for several years 37 tests showed that naegleria fowleri an extremely dangerous diseasecausing amoeba was in the water 38 the newly constructed thermae bath spa nearby designed by nicholas grimshaw and partners and the refurbished cross bath allow modernday bathers to experience the waters via a series of more recently drilled boreholes gallery  editbath abbey west front roman baths and pump
