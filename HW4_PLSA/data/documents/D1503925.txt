bands i work with “people don’t buy records because of what it represents to you people buy records because of what it represents to them” i’ve had guys in bands saying “i wouldn’t say that” but i

emotions fenced off it can be an emotional strain it means the whole writing session is at a distance i like someone who can spill their guts in a way it’s like counselling fb it’s hard to get a whole band to spill the beans you can usually work out quickly which members are interested in making sure the song emotionally resonates writing with a lot of people in the room can be tricky but a lot of

everyone’s level if an ar guy calls you up and says “we need a song” you need to know what was the last thing they brought out does the band need to progress and mature have your own understanding of
