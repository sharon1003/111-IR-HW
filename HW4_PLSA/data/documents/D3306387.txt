evans et al described it as “ the world’s largest preindustrial settlement complex” that also boasted a most sophisticated watermanagement system many scholars agree that the “age of angkor” began around 802 ce when a brahmin priest declared the hindu ruler jayavarman ii a devarāja or universal godking the religious significance of this is explained in the following excerpt from brittanica the devarāja cult grew out of both hindu and indigenous traditions it taught that the king was a divine universal ruler a manifestation of the hindu god śiva whose divine essence was represented by the linga or lingam a phallic idol housed in a special mountain temple the safeguarding of the linga became bound up with the security of the kingdom and the great temple architecture of the khmer period

jayavarman ii conquered the areas of cambodia into laos and united the khmer people of southeast asia and founded the khmer empire subsequently a grand celebration and ceremony took place on the phnom kulen plateau of a beautiful mountain range in the siem reap province at the ceremony jayavarman ii became the universal monarch or godking and he declared independence from “java” scholars are divided as to whether java meant the island or the neighboring cham people he placed the new capital in the area of what is now roluos and he named it hariharalaya after the hindu god shiva king

base of phnom kulen mountain until recently one of the most perplexing historic mysteries pertained to how the khmer people could have built this enormous temple in only 37 years initially experts mapped out a visible route that was 54 miles from the quarry to the site however recently etsuo uchida and ichita shimoda from waseda university in japan studied satellite images they could detect canals and roads that the jungles had swallowed up this allowed the team to establish a new route that was only 22 miles from the quarry khmer workers hauled somewhere between 5 million and 10 million blocks from the quarry site to build the main temple it was resplendent with more than 1860 carved apsara or heavenly nymphs and hundreds of meters of elaborate bas reliefs depicting the hindu legends and scenes from contemporary life other temples dating to his king suryavarman ii reign include banteay samre thommanon chau say tevoda and east of the capital the huge beng mealea complex unknown new discoveries in 2015 news emerged about a study called the great angkor project which was led by the university of sydney professor roland fletcher and dr damian evans the project utilized airborne laser scanning and ground penetrating radar with focused excavations they made some interesting discoveries about the monument the temple complex turned out to be larger than once thought additionally the scanning detected an immense structure not previously seen the researchers call the patterned structure the “rectilinear spirals” these consist of an area that has more than 1500 x 600 meters that flank the south side of the temple exactly what this structure was and its purpose are complete mysteries and “has as yet no known equivalent in the angkorian world” evans  fletcher 2015 the team also found a group of towers that had been buried on the west side they theorize that the builders may have had a shrine that they used during the construction phase possibly once the construction was over the builders took down the towers and buried them nearby end of the khmer after king suryavarman died around 1150 ce subsequent rulers continued to build temples some examples are angkor thom preah khan ta prohm and banteay chmar the decline of angkorian architecture seems to have been in conjunction with the khmer conversion to buddhism this took place around the first half of the 14th century angkor wat emerged in the golden period of the khmer empire the building survived through declining power and the total transition to another religion devotees never lost their vigor for the splendid temple which has since become theravada buddhist the central shrine that once housed a statue of vishnu was converted and vishnu was removed and replaced with statues of buddha today more than 100000 people still inhabit the archaeological park additionally buddhist worshippers continue to use the temple as a center of worship while millions of people flock from all over the world to see the most
