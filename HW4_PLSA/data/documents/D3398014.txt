broadway how to maintain your chill when youre starring in hamilton by clay skipper december 7 2015whats hot in the rap game right now history of course—and linmanuel miranda jonathan groff and daveed diggs told gq how their lives have changed now that theyre in the years biggest broadway show a shortlist of some of the names that matter in the rap game right now looks something like this kanye west drake nicki minaj fetty wap and alexander hamilton yup hamilton—or as the smashhit broadway musical named after him puts it the tendollar founding father without a father when linmanuel mirandas hiphopera about hamilton hit the richard rodgers theater in august it exploded into the brightly burning and constantly soldout star it is today the obamas have been twice because when a musical is this powerful this moving and has a transcendent moment this big the free world can wait after all its a free world we may never have had without hamilton and the burning revolutionary spirit of his contemporaries hamilton has done right by those revolutionaries recreating hamiltons story in the form of a musical masterpiece thats groundshaking in its own right we named the hamilton gang among gq s 2015 breakouts and called up linmanuel miranda who wrote and created the show and plays alexander hamilton daveed diggs who plays both lafayette in act i and thomas jefferson in act ii and jonathan groff king george iii to talk about why this play has blown up like it has what its like to play a rapping founding father and how your life changes when you become a very big deal very quickly this interview has been edited and condensed some notsobreaking news this thing is a big deal do you remember the moment when you realized that when it crossed the threshold into fullblown phenomenon linmanuel miranda there was a moment when we’d announced our last extension at the public theater where it played before it went on broadway oskar eustis who has been around the public a long time—he’s the guy who runs the public theater—walked in and said “you crashed our phone” that’s when i realized oh this is another thing this is not a typical theatrical experience phones at the public have never crashed before jonathan groff when we had supreme court justice kennedy in the audience who helped pass gay marriage and is creating legislation that is changing our lives and our kids’ lives and our kids’ kids’ lives that was pretty epic that he’s at hamilton like he’s at a musical miranda my joke is that the internet is just generating mad libs of people to show up and last night was the mad libiest of all steve martin of course a hero of anyone with a pulse harry belafonte spike lee nick cannon emily blunt and john krasinski selena gomez—it was like the internet came to the show last night do you get recognized in public now or invited to things has your life changed on that level as well trending this very secondculture diddy opens up about biggies death and the secret project hes working on with jayznewsandpolitics the great lie of conservatism miranda the fervor of it is getting a little crazier it’s a little like “you don’t understand i’m listening to the soundtrack right now” i get a lot of people holding their i phones up to me being like “this is actually what i’m listening to now and now i’m seeing you on the street”daveed diggs one day i was running to the gym and i got lost i’m in the bronx somewhere and this like seventeenyearold kid is crossing the street i’m running past him and he dropped his stuff on the ground “oh my god you’re thomas jefferson”  laughs i was like “that’s the first time anyone’s ever said that to me but yeah i am” and then you know he took a bunch of selfies and we talked for a little while the guy who runs the public theater walked in and said “you crashed our phone” that’s when i realized oh this is another thing this is not a typical theatrical experience daveed you have a rap background did you ever imagine you’d be doing musical theater diggs no man i mean i’d been an actor i majored in theater i did plays but musicals were not my thing and so now doing a thing where i get to use that skill set that i’m very comfortable with and that i’ve spent years cultivating to be rapping in a musical on broadway is just—that sentence doesn’t make any sense in my brain i know busta rhymes is a big fan of the show miranda yeah i mean one of the really amazing things is when you get to sort of cross the threshold into friendship of people you grew up idolizing the first broadway play that miranda wrote in the heights for all its accolades never really crossed over into the hiphop community the venn diagrams of musical theater and hiphop just weren’t meeting at that point and with this show to get a text from busta after the bet cypher saying “you bodied that shit”—you know that’s i’m framing that like i’m framing a text message diggs that’s the other great thing about what lin has done here—the writing is so good even by rappers’ standards five nine came to the show queen latifah was at the show mc hammer’s been twice who’s a personal hero of mine but real people from the hiphop community are coming and they’re always always really impressed by the bars and it’s great it wasn’t sort of dumbed down it’s funny that you had to come all the way to broadway for people to realize what a good rapper you are diggs yeah the fact that i got to do the hamilton bet cypher is a totally crazy thing because i’ve watched the bet cyphers since it started i’ve seen every one i study them because i’m a rapper it’s what you do you wait for that every year and i certainly dreamed and fantasized about being in one but you could have never told me that i would have to be in a musical—in a broadway musical—in order for that to happen miranda the show is a valentine to a lot of things it’s a valentine to history and to new york and to immigrants—but above all i think it’s a valentine to hiphop and sort of the founders in that world equating them with our founding fathers so to get respect from the people i revere in that world is really sort of the real joy my aunt and uncle who are mennonites came to see it my uncle was like it’s this and fiddler on the roof best shows i’ve ever seen the show appeals to a wide range of people who would never otherwise go to a broadway show to a lot of people it made broadway “cool” did you foresee that happening miranda there are people who only listen to broadway musicals there are people who only listen to hiphop and then most of us listen to a little of everything to me hiphop and musical theater both share the fact that they’re adaptable they can absorb styles and flip them for the storytelling i think what hamilton’s tapping into is the silent majority of people who like lots of different kinds of shit a lot of us go to tumblr and read like a jay z parks and recreation fan tumblr or go and see people make manga versions of shakespeare most of us just like good shit groff my aunt and uncle who are mennonites came to see it they’re literal dairy farmers from the fields of pennsylvania and they were blown away and i was like “did you follow like the rap and stuff” and they were like “totally we got all of it” and my uncle was like “it’s this and fiddler on the roof best shows i’ve ever seen” i was like there you go miranda and i think what people are responding to about hamilton is that it’s a musical but it’s not hermetically sealed it has a lot of influences from the rest of your life in it i think that’s what people are responding to just seeing themselves in the show seeing themselves reflected tell me about when you first heard about the idea of this show telling a founding father story through hiphop you had to be like what the hell groff i said yes to doing it without having heard or seen any of it i was friends with lin and director tommy kail and they were like “will you come and do this thing for two months this guy brian d’arcy james who originally played king george iii has to leave” and i was like “yeah sure it’ll be fun to do a play in new york and these guys are really nice” and i saw the show and i was like what i’m gonna be in that thing diggs when it was described to me i thought it was a terrible idea but i had known lin for a long time and i know how great he is so i of course was going to be a part of it and then as soon as i got sent the script and some of his rough drafts of the songs all of a sudden it made perfect sense but when your description of something is “somebody’s writing a bunch of raps for founding fathers…” it sounds like a joke potentially not a bad joke it could be a pretty good joke but i don’t know if that’s something i would ever think that i would spend like three years of my life working on and how do you manage to not take what it’s become for granted from becoming the new normal miranda the thing that keeps you humble in the face of it is we have to make the show from scratch every night if you go to a fivestar restaurant you’re not interested in what the reviewer ate you’re interested in having a good experience that night we have the ingredients we have the best chefs in town and we’ve gotta cook it congratulations on the mac arthur grant there must be tremendous pressure that comes with the “genius” label miranda i choose to take that mac arthur fellow as a vote of confidence from the universe that’s the only way i can think of it if i think of it as pressure then you know it’s actually antithetical to what they want to do their aim is to say “we love you here’s some money keep going” and i’m going to take that money and keep goingplease tell me that your family and close friends tease you about it now though like “oh the genius forgot to pick up the milk at the grocery store”miranda well what immediately happened was everyone started texting my wife just being like “why is he the one who got the genius grant everyone knows you’re the smarter one in the relationship”  laughsin terms of the sentiment expressed by a lot of the characters in this show—why are we here what do we do with the time we’re given—those are questions i really wrestle with on a daytoday basis i think we all do you had a great quote about seeing phantom of the opera “oh shit it’s about an ugly songwriter who wants to impose his will on the world and i related to that” do you feel like youre doing that now miranda what imposing my will on the world  laughsi mean you have right miranda it’s hard to make a musical feel personal honestly and hamilton ’s about as naked as i’ve got i don’t mean that in like i’m like hamilton i didn’t come from another country i’ve had a pretty blessed life but in terms of the sentiment expressed by a lot of the characters in this show—why are we here what do we do with the time we’re given—those are questions i really wrestle with on a daytoday basis i think we all do what are we supposed to do with the time we have on this earth and when we see someone like a hamilton who did three lifetimes’ worth in such a short amount of time it makes us reckon with what we’re doing busta had an amazing quote when he saw the show he said “you see the show and you feel like i’m not doing enough” and that’s how i felt when i read the book of hamilton’s life and i think that that’s a nice feeling to put into the world of like what are we doing  laughs with the time we have what is it about this play thats resonating so deeply with people who see it diggs the first time i did a workshop of it chris jackson was playing george washington and it changed everything the first time i heard him sing as george washington because he was so clearly george washington so all of a sudden this guy that i know really well we’ve been freestyling together for years and i know his family i know his kids i know his wife—this is george washington a regular person who looks like people who i know who has many successes and many failures and is not a perfect human being but is a great great man all of a sudden i have a real connection to this founding father who’s been the dude on the money for so long or like you know some shit about a cherry tree having this living breathing real passionate and supremely virtuosic human being be the standin for what that person is in my brain—and that’s forever now any time i think about george washington it’s chris jackson and if something similar to that is happening for people who come see the show the effect really is profound because that gives me a type of ownership over the history of this country that i didn’t have before hamilton linmanuel miranda broadway music more stories like this onestar wars the force awakens will feature music
