tier 1 means that the government is in compliance with the u s governments minimum standards of the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of 2000 to eliminate trafficking 4 the minimum standards as listed in section 108 of the legislation are 1 the government of the country should prohibit severe forms of trafficking in persons and punish acts of such trafficking 2 for the knowing commission of any act of sex trafficking involving force fraud coercion or in which the victim of sex trafficking is a child incapable of giving meaningful consent or of trafficking which includes rape or kidnapping or which causes a death the government of the country should prescribe punishment commensurate with that for grave crimes such as forcible sexual assault 3 for the knowing commission of any act of a severe form of trafficking in persons the government of the country should prescribe punishment that is sufficiently stringent to deter and that adequately reflects the heinous nature of the offense 4 the government of the country should make serious and sustained efforts to eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons 5 6the u s is working to eliminate human trafficking in the u s and worldwide each year the department of state releases data compiled on the state of human trafficking in many different countries including the u s in accordance with the trafficking victim protection act of 2000s standards see below 5 in addition it also releases data on trafficking cases under federal prosecution and estimates of those trafficked however the report also cautions that the data may not be representative of the number of individuals actually trafficked due to both the lack of cohesion between many states and agencies battling human trafficking and the inability to account for undiscovered victims 7 below is a compilation of data from a variety of u s agencies and the united nations attorney general  editaccording to the attorney generals 2001  clarification needed report an estimated 14000 people are trafficked into the united states each year although again because trafficking is illegal accurate statistics are difficult to compile 82011 department of justice report  editthe findings of the u s department of justices 2011 report “characteristics of suspected human trafficking incidents 20082010” include from 2008 to 2010 federal antitrafficking task forces opened 2515 suspected cases of human trafficking82 of suspected incidents were classified as sex trafficking and nearly half of these involved victims under the age of 18 approximately 10 of the incidents were classified as labor trafficking83 of victims in confirmed sextrafficking incidents were identified as u s citizens while most confirmed labortrafficking victims were identified as undocumented immigrants 67 or legal immigrants 2825 of the confirmed victims received a  t visa  part of a federal program designed to aid victims of trafficking while the findings represent the government’s best estimate the authors caution that “the data described in this report reflect the information that was available to and entered by these state and local law enforcement agencies” and such data systems are still being established and are likely not recording all incidents 92011 department of state report  editaccording to the department of state the u s was identified as a tier 1 country with unspecified federal agencies charging 181 individuals with trafficking other humans and obtaining 141 convictions in 103 human trafficking prosecutions of the prosecutions reported by the department of state 32 were labor trafficking cases and 71 were sex trafficking cases 10immigration and customs enforcement  editduring 2009 ice initiated 566 cases these investigations led to 388 criminal arrests more than double the number of arrests from the previous fiscal year resulting in 148 indictments and 165 convictions 11human smuggling and trafficking center  editthe human smuggling and trafficking center is an interagency intelligence center that gathers information on illicit travel—including that of trafficking the center also coordinates with foreign agencies and diplomats to monitor and fight trafficking on an international basis with the enactment of tvpra 2008 the hstc was also charged with the responsibility of compiling a comprehensive interagency database on persons identified as victims of human trafficking 11prevalence  editgeographic distribution of forced laborers  editaccording to the 2011 department of state report victims are largely from thailand india mexico philippines haiti honduras el salvador and the dominican republic though u s citizens have also been victims of human trafficking 10 relevant to people being trafficked from other countries  vulnerabilities are increasingly found in visa programs for legally documented students and temporary workers who typically fill labor needs in the hospitality landscaping construction food service and agricultural industries 12human trafficking occurred consistently in highpopulation areas that serve as hubs for international travel and that have large immigrant populations in the study higher numbers of reported cases were found in california new york texas and florida this is consistent with the u s department of justice report that the largest concentrations of survivors of human trafficking were located in california oklahoma new york and texas 13 according to the national human trafficking resource center nhtrc roughly 979000 of the human trafficking cases reported by state are from california making it the most affected area in the united states 14criticism  editaccording to a 2007 washington post expose entitled human trafficking evokes outrage little evidence human trafficking into the united states is essentially nonexistent 15however there are more victims than those who have applied for and been granted certification first certification requires that the victim be willing to cooperate with a police investigation following a police raid some victims just want to go home some victims don’t want to cooperate with police and are deported and some victims are afraid to testify against vicious traffickers the application for certification requires support from law enforcement if the victim is not seen as useful for a case or if the police dont want to pursue a case they have no support to stay in the u s and will not be counted as victims of trafficking nevertheless the number of identified victims or convicted traffickers is far less than the official estimate by the u s state department that as many 14500–17500 individuals are trafficked into the united states every year 16 a recent analysis by the justice departments bureau of justice statistics showed a gap between the claimed number of victims and the number of confirmed cases of victimization 17a gap between the alleged number of victims and the number of confirmed cases also characterizes the situation worldwide the u s department of state recently reported that 04 percent of the estimated victims of trafficking internationally had been officially identified 18 the state department report provided no source for the number of either estimated or identified victims some critics like markon in the washington post note that all such estimates are deeply flawed 19types  editresearch conducted by university of california at berkeley on behalf of the antitrafficking organization free the slaves found that about 46 of people in slavery in the united states are forced into prostitution the u s department of justice prosecuted 360 defendants for human trafficking from 2001 to 2007 and gained 238 convictions 20from january 2007 through september 2008 there were 1229 alleged cases of human trafficking nationally 1018 of them nearly 83 percent were sex trafficking cases sex trafficking has a close relationship with migrant smuggling operations headed by mexican eastern european and asian crime organizations 21 domestic servitude claims 27 of people in slavery in the u s agriculture 10 and other occupations 17 13 22sex trafficking  editmain article sex trafficking in the united states louise slaughter testifies at a ways  means human resources subcommittee hearing on october 23 2013 louise testified in strong support of a bill she has cosponsored with rep erik paulsen rmn that address the high rate of children in foster care being recruited into sex trafficking within the united states 10445204615the u s department of health  human services estimated that between 240000 and 325000 children are at risk for sexual exploitation each year children who are considered runaways are at particular risk of prostitution or of being trafficked into the sex industry of the 1682900 children who were considered runaways for a period of time in 1999 71 were considered at risk for prostitution 20 1700 of those reported actually engaging in sexual activity in exchange for money david finkelhor a university of new hampshire professor who is director of the crimes against children research center said i wouldnt put any stock in these figures as indicators of what is going on today 23commercial sexual exploitation of children  editsee also commercial sexual exploitation of children § united states in 2003 1400 minors were arrested for prostitution 14 of whom were younger than 14 years old a study conducted by the international labor union indicated that boys are at a higher risk of being trafficked into agricultural work the drug trade and petty crime girls were at a higher risk of being forced into the sex industry and domestic work in 2004 the department of labor found 1087 minors employed in situations that violated hazardous occupation standards the same year 5480 children were employed violating child labor laws due to the secretive nature of trafficking it is difficult to piece together an accurate picture of how widespread the problem is 20in 2001 the university of pennsylvania school of social work released a study on csec conducted in 17 cities across the united states while they did not interview any of the adolescent subjects of the inquiry they estimated through secondary response that as many as 300000 american youth may be at risk of commercial sexual exploitation at any time 24 the center for court innovation in new york city had used respondent driven sampling rds social network analysis capturerecapture and markov based probability estimates in 2008 to generate a prevalence estimate for new york city alone and found that there were approximately 3800 children that were identified as commercial sexual exploitation victims researchers said this was an underestimate of the actual number as isolated subgroups outside their sampling methodology exist and could not be estimated 25 an article by the village voice that reviewed arrest records in 37 large us cities over 10 years found only 827 cases a year had been reported to police departments 26especially vulnerable are homeless and runaways the national runaway switchboard said in 2009 that onethird of runaway youths in america will be lured into prostitution within 48 hours on the streets 27 this view of adolescent prostitution in the united states as primarily driven by pimpexploiters and other sex traffickers was challenged by snrgnyc in their 2008 new york city study which interviewed over 300 underage prostitutes and found that only 10 reported having pimps a 2012 study done in atlantic city new jersey by the same group incorporated an extended qualitative ethnographic component that looked specifically at the relationship between pimps and adolescents engaged with street based sex markets 28 29 this study found the percentage of adolescents who had pimps to be only 14 and that those relationships were typically far more complex mutual and companionate than has been reported by social service providers notforprofits and much of the news media 30the new york state office of children and family services estimated in 2007 that new york city is home to more than 2000 sexually exploited children under 18 at least 85 percent of these youths statewide have had some contact with the child welfare system mostly through abuse or neglect proceedings in new york city 75 percent have been in foster care 31 mishi faruqee who is in charge of juvenile justice issues for the correctional association of new york questioned the reliability of the estimate “we believe that number is really an undercount 32 this is confirmed by snrgnycs new york city population estimate of 2008 which was 3946 super bowls  editexterior of

victims of human trafficking during super bowl xlix authorities led a sting operation called national day of johns and arrested almost 600 people and rescued 68 victims 33labor trafficking  editmain article labor trafficking in the united states according to the national human rights center in berkeley california there are currently about 10000 forced laborers in the u s around onethird of whom are domestic servants and some portion of whom are children in reality this number could be far higher due to the difficulty in getting exact numbers of victims due to the secretive nature of human trafficking the u s government only keeps a count of survivors defined as victims of severe instances of human trafficking who have been assisted by the government in acquiring immigration benefits 13 research at san diego state university estimates that there are 24 million victims of human trafficking among illegal mexican immigrants 34 research by the urban institute says that law enforcement agencies do not prioritize labor trafficking cases were reluctant to help victims obtain authorization to legally remain in the united states and felt there was not enough evidence to corroborate victim statements 35in 2014 the national human trafficking resource center reported 990 cases of forced labor trafficking in the us including 172 which also involved sex trafficking the most common types of labor trafficking included domestic work traveling sales crews agriculturefarms restaurantfood service health  beauty services begging retail landscaping hospitality construction carnivals elder care forestry manufacturing and housekeeping 36agriculture  editin the agriculture sector the most common victims of trafficking are u s citizens and legal permanent residents undocumented immigrants and foreign nationals with temporary h2a visas 37h2a visa is a certification program which is the employers contracting people from other countries but first the employers must try to recruit u s workers before looking abroad 38 in attempts towards seeking employees once they are hired they may encounter some difficulties such as1 may not be able to join a union or face legal challenges2 requirements that farmers may not meet because of the program 38h2a visas are temporary visas that allow people from other countries to work in the united states with some benefits contractors need to provide to them examples include “farmers are required to these workers with housing and pay for transportation to the job pay them at least threequarters of the season at a higher rate than the average paid rate of that work” 38 yet the circumstances of the law states for free housing “prevailing practice in the area and occupation of intended employment” 38 for farmers who are working and have families means that they are not guaranteed housing situations farm workers being controlled greatly their lives are vulnerable in fears that they may be deported back to their homeland 38due to the nature of agricultural work as being seasonal and transient the ability of employers to exploit these workers is high such exploitation may take the form of threats of violence and playing on vulnerabilities ie immigration status in some cases workers are held in a state of perpetual debt to the crew leaders who impose mandatory transportation housing and communication fees upon the workers which are high in relation to pay received therefore further indebting the worker crew leaders may also provide workers with h2a visas and transportation to the place of work from a home country part of the h2a visa is that it does not provide an adequate choosing of their employment how much would they be paid for their work or even the hours are not negotiable undocumented people who come without any visas have a greater chance of choosing of where they wish to work and decide to leave the employment if they wish and have a better chance of not being exploited 39in 2010 the company global horizons was indicted on charges of trafficking over 200 thai workers with the program bonded labor it was guaranteed that the workers were going to receive a visa that would allow them to live and work in the united states upon arrival the company made a false statement to lure the workers and having a higher recruitment the fees that were imposed to the farm workers were so high that the debt was impossible to pay with the employment they were given many were living in poor housing conditions up to a dozen living per homethreats and even physical assaults 40domestic labor  editdomestic servitude is the forced employment of someone as a maid or nanny and victims are often migrant women who come from lowwage communities in their home countries 41 domestic workers perform duties such as cleaning cooking and childcare in their employers home domestic workers are commonly us citizens undocumented workers or foreign nationals most commonly holding one of the following visa types a3 g5nato7 or b1 42 the most common victims of this type of trafficking are women similar means of control to agricultural work are common additionally a lack of legislation regarding the duties and protection of these workers facilitates their exploitation employers commonly use the workers lack of knowledge of the language or legal system as a means of control and intimidation this is also commonly paired with various forms of abuse andor passport revocation many domestic workers are brought to the united states on a promise of a better life or an education 43 traffickers are usually married couples from the same country of origin as the trafficked person 44 and are usually not involved in organized criminal networks 45 making it more difficult to identify instances of this type of trafficking perpetrators of domestic servitude are often wellrespected members of their communities and lead otherwise normal lives 45 areas with large middleclass and uppermiddleclass populations are commonly the destinations of this type of trafficking 41the associated press reports based on interviews in california and egypt that trafficking of children for domestic labor in the u s includes an extension of an illegal but common practice in africa families in remote villages send their daughters to work in cities for extra money and the opportunity to escape a deadend life some girls work for free on the understanding that they at least will be better fed in the home of their employer this custom has led to the spread of trafficking as welltodo africans accustomed to employing children immigrate into the u s 46legally employed domestic workers are distinct from illegally employed domestic servants while legally employed domestic house workers are fairly compensated for their work in accordance with national wage laws domestic servants are typically forced to work extremely long hours for little to no monetary compensation and psychological and physical means are employed to limit their mobility and freedom 41 in addition deportation threats are often used to discourage internationally trafficked persons from seeking help 41traveling sales crew  edittraveling sales crews have the highest rate of calls to human trafficking hotlines after domestic labor counting from january 2008 to february 2015 the mobile nature makes it easier for traffickers to control their victims sleeping arrangements and food and to alienate them from outside contact traffickers may withhold food or threaten to abandon their victims in unfamiliar locations without money if they do not comply unlike other professions members of traveling sales crews are considered independent contractors even if they do not have any autonomy in their life outside of work as independent contractors they are not overseen by several laws meant to prevent abuse such as title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 victims often incur debt from their traffickers and enter into a form of debt slavery 47malinda’s traveling sales crew protection act  editwisconsin state senator jon erpenbach malinda’s traveling sales crew protection act 48 is a wisconsin law that gives traveling sales crew members similar employment rights as parttime workers in wisconsin are currently guaranteed by state law it also requires all crews to register with the department of agriculture trade and consumer protection before going door to door in state communities by registering members of the crew alerts for members with outstanding warrants in other states can be identified and criminals detained 49 it is the only law in the united states that regulates traveling sales crews 47 wisconsin governor james e doyle says the intent of the law is to stop companies from putting workers in dangerous and unfair conditions the bill was passed in a form that applies only to sales workers who travel in groups of two or more 50 it was authored by jon erpenbach 49 southwestern advantagelobbied against the bill arguing that their independent contractor business model nurtured the entrepreneurial spirit 51 52 during the hearings former southwestern student dealers testified on both sides of the issue 53human trafficking among the latin american community  editaccording to polaris hotline statistics people from latin america makes up almost one third of the population of victims of human traffic in the united states 54 most victims are from mexico haiti honduras el salvador and the dominican republic 54 nearly 29 percent of victims enter the us through the mexicounited states border by human smuggling while majority come with work visas 55vulnerabilities and recruitment  editthere are some circumstances or vulnerabilities that have led some latin americans to a higher susceptibility to victimization and human trafficking the relationship between “push” factors that result in poverty ie unemployment natural disasters drug abuse etc and “pull” factors ie risky job opportunities deceitful romantic relationships the american dream that is fueled by mass media etc encourages latin americans to accept risky job proposition in the us once the victims fall for deceitful labor recruiters traffickers exploit vulnerabilities to keep victims under their control such as language barrier and illiteracy fear of deportation due to lack of documentation isolation from family friends and the public unfamiliarity with surroundings and with the laws indebtedness drug dependence and physical and psychological abuse deportation can often leave trafficked victims at the mercy of their traffickers once again or it may cause harm to their families through either punishment by the traffickers or a loss of remittances that the traffickers had been sending to the family 56 furthermore when natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes strike latin american countries traffickers often capitalize on impoverished families who can’t afford to support their kids in 2013 three years after a 70magnitude earthquake devastated haiti the united states government estimated that between 150000 and 500000 children in haiti were involved in domestic servitude 57coyotaje  editwith the increase in u s border security undocumented latino immigrants have increasingly turned to smugglers to lead them through mexico and across the u smexican border the colloquial term coyotaje refers to human smuggling along the mexicounited states border the term used to imply that the relationship between the smuggler and the migrant ended once the they arrived in the us 58 however it has become increasingly commonplace for coyotes to coerce migrants into exploitative labor arrangements upon reaching their destination in the u s frequently a different one from that which they paid to be smuggled to 58 these smuggling routes have become more dangerous and therefore costlier making some smugglers sell undocumented migrants into situations of forced labor or prostitution to recover their costs 58 illegal immigrants transiting mexico often fail to report abuses committed against them by criminals or officials in their home countries or along their journey because of fears of deportation unaccompanied minors are sometimes sold into prostitution by the trafficker and their families are falsely led to believe that they died during transit 58labor trafficking  editagriculture  editaccording to cases reported to polarisoperated hotlines survivors of this type of labor trafficking are disproportionately latino male migrant workers mostly from mexico and central america on seasonal h2a visas despite the h2a program requirement that employers supply workers with suitable housing traffickers have also been known to subject victims to squalid living conditions often denying them even necessities such as beds and indoor toilets 54 this type of labor trafficking occurs in places from orange orchards to corn fields but some crops such as tobacco require much more intensive labor to harvest making them more susceptible to forced labor or exploitation by far the most common method of control in agriculture as in many other types is economic abuse including wage theft improper deductions and payment at piece rates rather than hourly rates 54restaurants  editdata from polaris has indicated that foreign national men and women from mexico and central america tend to be equally victimized victims can be confined at the restaurant around the clock or be isolated in a nearby home provided by the traffickers 54domestic workers  edithaving a legal work visa is not necessarily a protection against abuse the urban institute estimated 82 of cases of domestic worker trafficking it reviewed had come to the us on legal visas 59 labor trafficking victims in domestic work commonly work 1218 hours a day some as much as 247 for little to no pay they may experience extreme isolation and confinement from the outside world sexual harassment high levels of monitoring debt bondage extreme wage theft confiscation of critical documents such as passports and restricted access to food and medical care 54construction  editmost of labor trafficking survivors in construction are men from mexico and the northern triangle el salvador honduras and guatemala most of whom have h2b visas or are undocumented workers can enter their exploitative situations through formal job offers and misrepresented visa contracts in some cases workers may be charged illegal and exorbitant recruitment fees which may be a method of control to keep workers in abusive situations recruitment may also begin through an abusive migration journey or through wordofmouth referrals 54sex trafficking  editmost of the victims that suffer from sex trafficking come from mexico central america the caribbean and only 11 come from the united states severe brutality and abuse are the tactics used to control the victims over half who are only minors 54 it generally grosses a profit of 32 billion every year 96 of the potential victims are female from either mexico or central america and 63  of the victims are minors because the traffickers in the cantinas are eager to target young girls 54bars and cantinas  editwoman and girls from ages 1429 from the area demographics of mexico and central america are often victimized by bars and cantinas 60 the latina woman and girls who are targeted by trafficker’s lack economic needs english fluency and legal status which makes the process easier for traffickers to manipulate them 54escort services  editlatin american women and girls that are smuggled into the united states are also often exposed to the world of commercial sex trade better known as “escort services” there are two ways in which the operation can proceed one is described as “outcall” where the traffickers deliver victims to the buyer’s hotel room or even their homes and the second option is “incall” which is when the customers cycle in and out of a hotel room while the trafficker extends the victims stay many of these interactions between the buyers the traffickers and victims took place on the website backpagecom where latinas had their own category the website has been closed since january 2017 54latino brothels  editbrothels catering exclusively to latino males referred to as latino residential brothels are a major vehicle for sex trafficking with the victims being almost exclusively women and children from latin america 61 62 63 trafficking of u s citizens within the u s occurs as well they typically own informal underground businesses in urban suburban and rural areas structural factors  editpoverty  editpoverty can lead to increased trafficking in many different ways poverty affects the notion of individual choice and often drives families to make decisions out of desperation and lack of education 64 poverty in some countries may influence parents to send their children to work in another urban country with a more stable economy such as the u s without the knowledge that the child is then forced into slave labor or prostitution furthermore once this kidnapping and trafficking of the child occurs the victim often accepts their situation and limits efforts to escape their imprisonment oftentimes they wind up alone in a country where they do not speak the language making it difficult to seek aid 65 in addition victims often accept their positions because they feel that this is the only way that they may send some remittances to their family and their enslaved situations may in some cases still be better than their original impoverished and desperate state 64globalization  editthe rate of human trafficking has directly increased in correlation with globalization 66 globalization has increased crossborder trade and the demand for cheap labor however migration policies of the u s and other countries have not changed with the level of demand for cheap labor thus forcing people illegally to immigrate 64 illegal immigration then creates ideal conditions for organized criminal operations to form trafficking circles 64 with increased trade of foreign goods to rural areas import competition in the rural markets has also forced people in poor areas to migrate to industrialized economies for better livelihoods their desperate positions often make them subject to exploitation and trafficking into different forms of forced labor to support that economy 64 lastly the technological advances that go hand in hand with globalization have facilitated the ease with which organized crime circles may conduct trafficking operations 64prostitution  editsome feminists such as carole pateman believe that exploitation is in both prostitution and sex trafficking 67 they believe that even if the women agreed to be a sex worker in a foreign country that the worker was still trafficked because of the preceding conditions that lead her to believe that sex work was the only viable work option 67 other feminists such as kamala kempadoo on the other hand believe that prostitution is a form of labor just like any other migrant labor however due to the criminalization of prostitution prostitutes are then subject to coercion and exploitation and subsequent trafficking 56 in the usa each year 80000 women are arrested for prostitution current debates about modifications to trafficking victims protection act of 2000 policy are based about these two arguments in providing aid for victims of sex trafficking the government must take a stand on whether or not they believe the sex industry and sex trafficking are inherently linked 64 these people involved in prostitution have an 80 higher chance of sexually transmitted infections and many never can afford to seek treatment this results in serious infections lifelong diseases and sometimes even death 68fear of government corruption  editeven though the u s offers protection for trafficking victims few victims seek the governments aid due to fear of corruption fear of deportation or fear of reprisals with their family 69 victims of trafficking may be citizens of countries with corrupt governments that actually aid trafficking 69 where victims home countries lack reliable police systems trafficking victims are hesitant to reach out to the law for aid jessa dillow crisp was of many victims of human trafficking who had encountered the police in her town to be corruptive and involved in the trafficking 70antitrafficking laws and policies  editthis section needs additional

the drug enforcement administration the immigration and customs enforcement the united states department of justice civil rights division and criminal section and other federal agencies victims of trafficking and violence protection act  editthe victims of trafficking and violence protection act of 2000 allowed for greater statutory maximum sentences for traffickers provided resources for protection of and assistance for victims of trafficking and created avenues for interagency cooperation it also allows many trafficking victims to remain in the u s and apply for permanent residency under a t1 visa 71 previously trafficked individuals who were often in the country illegally were treated as criminals according to the section on severe forms of trafficking in persons the definition extends to include any commercial sex act  in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age 72 this means that any minor engaged in prostitution is a victim of human trafficking regardless of citizenship or whether or not movement has taken place 73the law defines trafficking as the prohibition against any individual who provides or obtains labor or services for peonage slavery involuntary servitude or forced labor the law distinguishes trafficking where victims are coerced into entering the u s from smuggling where migrants enter the country without authorization 74 the act also attempted to encourage efforts to prevent human trafficking internationally by creating annual country reports on trafficking and tying financial nonhumanitarian assistance to foreign countries to real efforts in addressing human trafficking the benefits of the law however are dependent on the survivors cooperation with prosecuting the perpetrators this can be complicated if the victim fears retribution from their trafficker or has a fear of authority that remains from their country of origin 13the original tvpa of 2000 has been reauthorized three times the
