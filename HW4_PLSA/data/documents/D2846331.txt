what is a valueproposition posted on 23 january 2013 by tom g — 11 comments ↓‘valueproposition’ is a term muchbandiedabout in businessmodels and the like yet what exactly is it a tweet by alex osterwalder pointed me to an article by steve blank on ‘ how to build a billiondollar startup ‘ which included this brief section on the role of the product or service is it a problem or a need i’ve now come to believe that the value proposition in a business model value proposition is the fancy name for your product or service fits into either one of two categories — it solves a problem and gets a job done for a consumer or a company accounting software elevators airconditioning electricity tablet computers electric toothbrushes airplanes email software etc  — or it fulfills a fundamental human social need friendship dating sex entertainment art communication blogs confession networking gambling religion etc all fair enough useful advice indeed but wait a moment what was that throwaway comment there…the value proposition in a business model value proposition is the fancy name for your product or service…no no no fundamentally completely absolutely wrong that view of ‘valueproposition’ is exactly what not to door rather what steve says above is how we’d usually frame it in classic pushmarketing – where to be blunt the role of the supposed ‘valueproposition’ is often to hide the fact that the proposed product or service doesn’t have much real value…in pushmarketing we start from the proposition and then look for the value we start from the product or service – something that we know we can make or do and therefore want to be able to sell to make it supposedlysaleable we hunt around for something that could be called a ‘value’ especially one that could differentiate this product or service from all those others that look just about exactly the same because they’re things that people know how to make or do hence the idea that the ‘valueproposition’ consists of terms such as cheaper  faster  better  new at least as seen ‘ insideout ‘ from the organisation’s perspective to ‘the market’ it’s called ‘push’ because we use the supposedvalue to push our product or service at people and it’s clear simple easy to understand easily measurable and all the rest so we see it absolutely everywhere – but it doesn’t work well for anyone in many cases all it really manages to do is create ‘a race to the bottom’ where noone wins oops…by contrast in pullmarketing we start from the value and then look for the proposition value first then proposition that’s why it’s correctly called a ‘valueproposition’ for example as steve blank does explain well in the second half of that quote above two key categories of value are problem and perceivedneed  chris potts summarised it nicely in the following tweet valueproposition listen to music wherever you want with no discs tapes etc product eg i pod to be pedantic chris’ ‘valueproposition’ there is more the ‘problem’ or ‘need’ the driver that links between value and valueproposition we’ll come back to that in a moment it’s called ‘pull’ because we use the connection to a broader meaning of value to pull people into mutual conversation with us and thence from that conversation identify an appropriate product or service for their problem or need it’s not as simple as ‘push’ partly because what we need to deliver may vary quite a lot from one person to another partly because we need the empathy to work with an ‘outsidein’ perspective rather than from a literally selfcentred ‘insideout’ view and partly because we have to juggle two different meanings of ‘value’ – the ‘vertical’ connection to vision and values which creates the pull and the ‘horizontal’ flow of value that satisfies the need yet when it’s done well the power of pull provides for everyone’s needs – and everyone wins let’s use enterprise canvas to look at this first to simplify things we assert that ‘everything is a service’ – a product is thus a kind of ‘protoservice’ a means through which to deliver a selfservice in the most basic view in enterprise canvas a service is a means to an end that sits somewhere on a vertical axis between desiredends – what we want the service to deliver or help to deliver – and realisedends – what the service can or has actually delivered we’d typically apply a ‘five whys’ to identify the overall vision and concomitant values for this service to me the vision has three distinct components that are shared by everyone in the effective sharedenterprisethe what or withwhat – something that identifies for the content or focus for this enterprisethe how – some kind of action on that content or focusthe why – a qualifier that validates and bridges between content and action various values fall out of the vision – and they provide the reason for people to connect with each other across the enterprise the value that forms the startpoint for the valueproposition to use the ted example “ideas worth spreading” the whole point is that these are not just ideas that are being spread around these are ideas that are worth spreading or to use chris’ example above the real driver is more like good music everywhere anywhere which then leads ‘downward’ more towards the practicaldetail of ‘how’ and ‘withwhat’ tomusic i can carry with meadd a bit more detail my own choice of music i can carry with me without hassleexpand on ‘without hassle’ preferably something small that i can easily carry anywhere and doesn’t need the clutter of discs or tapes which brings us to chris’ specific ‘valueproposition request ‘ to which an example response – the proposition in the ‘valueproposition’ is as chris says the i pod starting from the vision and the value the service presents – proposes – an offer which would satisfy a need in relation to that value that’s why we talk about ‘valueflow’ because it’s a flow or sequence of exchanges that in some way delivers something ‘of value’ for everyone in relation to that value hence in visual form and if we expand this view outward as a valuechain or valueweb at each stage in the sequence of exchanges the respective players establish the connection of sharedvision and values and then explore the proposition that the serviceprovider offers to satisfy a problem or perceivedneed in relation to the vision and values the connection of values provides the ‘pull’ towards the valueproposition this happens in distinct stagesbefore transaction establish the valueconnection – the effective definition of what value ‘is’ in this contextbefore transaction explore the relevance of the valueproposition – how and to what extent relative to those values this product or service will satisfy the overall problem or perceivedneedduring transaction deliver the product or service in accordance with the proposed deliveredvalue – such as specified in a servicelevel agreement – again relative to those specified or implied sharedvaluesafter transaction evaluate satisfaction in relation to the offer or ‘promise’ and ultimately in relation to those sharedvaluesafter transaction resolve any required valuebalance – such as via payment etc to summarise those overall relationships in a bit more detail the valueweb isn’t solely about the horizontal supplychain that’s just the how and withwhat of the transactional relationship that’s the visible part of value sure yet it’s actually held together through a more vertical connection of why – the reason or purpose for the relationship between the players to exist valueproposition provides the link between why how and withwhat incidentally this is the key reason behind a perhapssubtle yet important difference between business model canvas – focussed on the core businessmodel – and enterprise canvas – designed more for wholeofenterprise architecture in business model canvas the value proposition cell provides the central spine for the whole businessmodel yet it provides us with no means to distinguish between value horizontal and values vertical nor to distinguish between the valuemetrics for a product or service versus the product or service itself – they’re all conflated together into the one ‘valueproposition’ which in effect forces us into steve blank’s assertion that “value proposition is the fancy name for your product or service” – and in turn all but traps us into a pushmarketing model for products and services which rarely works well in enterprise canvas though we draw explicit distinctions between those different concernsvalueproposition proposes value – it establishes the connection to vertical sharedvalues as a shared story and identifies the horizontal problem or need to be satisfied by the providervaluecreation creates value – it delivers horizontal value against the identified and agreed problem or need – typically in the form of products andor services – and in relation to the sharedvaluesvaluegovernance governs value – verifies that value has been delivered in accordance with the problem or need and the sharedvalues or story to the satisfaction of all parties in that story together these three cells form the central spine of businessmodel much as with the single value proposition cell in business model canvas yet whilst they’re strongly interdependent and in some ways act as one they deal with distinct and different aspects of the overall valueflow in the businessmodel and in practice they’re often enacted by different people or entities too it also makes it much easier to understand how to design a ‘pull’based businessmodel rather than default back to the inherentlyineffective ‘push’ so overall it’s definitely useful to be able to separateout the different subthemes in this way this threeway distinction also makes it simpler to understand the different interactions that happen – often with different parties – in the different stages of the valueflow and since any given service in an enterprise is both a provider of some services and also a consumer of other services it does make more sense to lay this out in symmetrical form – another subtleyetimportant difference from business model canvas if we turn this sidewayson with the ‘inside’ spine on the left and the ‘outwardfacing’ elements on the right we can then also describe the overall sequence and structure and drivers of the interactions and subflows that make up the overall story of the businessmodel again each of those central cells or in this diagram above the lefthand cells manages a different part of the businessmodel storyvalueproposition guides and drives the why for the service’s activitiesvaluecreation presents the how and withwhat of the service and its products linked back to that whyvaluegovernance links and verifies the withwhat the how and the why always striving to reduce the gap and tension between desiredends and realisedends in short valueproposition is not “the fancy name for your product or service” yes they’re closely related but they do need to be understood as separate and distinct and if you do allow them to blur together
