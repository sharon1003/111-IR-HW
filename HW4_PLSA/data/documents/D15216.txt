programs or local areas of jurisdiction for purposes of medicare level iii codes were also referred to as local codes local codes were established when an insurer preferred that suppliers use a local code to identify a service for which there is no level i or level ii code rather than use a miscellaneous or not otherwise classified code the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa required cms to adopt standards for coding systems that are used for reporting health care transactions we published in the federal register on august 17 2000 65 fr 50312 regulations to implement this part of the hipaa legislation these regulations provided for the elimination of level iii local codes by october 2002 at which time the level i and level ii code sets could be used the elimination of local codes was postponed as a result of section 532 a of bipa which continued the use of local codes through december 31 2003 source httpwwwcmshhsgovmed hcpcsgen info free 28 day trial
