trade deficits why do they move exchange rates economics0trade balances deficits and fx © forexop you have probably read a lot about balance of payments and trade deficits in the financial press but these reports often do not explain how and why these things affect currencies a country’s balance of payments bo p is the record of its financial transactions with the outside world what does it mean when a country has a trade deficit and what does it mean for the currency inputs to understand this it helps to think of countries simply as entities that earn and spend just like a business there is no need to worry about what is going on inside because the balance of payments only records transaction into and out of the country not what is going on within when a country is importing more than it exports this means it has a balance of trade deficit in other words it is consuming more than it is producing why does this matter for the currency to pay for imported goods and services importers have to sell the domestic currency in the foreign exchange market to pay for them this is money being spent or leaving the country to pay for something the balance of trade records these inflows and outflows the rule that trade deficits are bad for currencies and surpluses are good is over simplistic just like a person or a business a country cannot go on spending more than it earns forever however the rule that deficits are bad for currencies and surpluses are good is over simplistic the borrowing may be good risk because it is adding value to the economy or bad risk because it is not and that determines how the currency markets will react why do trade deficits occur just like businesses economies sometimes need to borrow to grow let us look at a toy example to explain this in more detail table 1 shows the balance of trade over five years for a fictitious emerging economy in year 1 the country imports 200b worth of goods and exports 400b it has a trade surplus in the following year it imports 350b and exports 200b so in that year it has a trade deficit by year 5 the trade deficit is 520b the total deficit  trade gap over 5 years stands at 1370b this is the total balance of trade what does this mean it means the country has spent 1370b more than it has earned over this period the amount 1370b represents wealth that has left the country over the five years and is now in the hands of foreign investors governments and corporations it will be in cash bonds or other assets denominated in the currency economists call this the capital account table 1year 1 2 3 4 5imports

the country albeit with a lower exchange rate this is not the case transactions in the fx market would simply change ownership from one foreign owner to another the amount above 1370b is money spent by this country and the only way it can come back is through foreign trade or investment gains for example suppose in year 1 a big corporate had invested 1b in an overseas company by year 5 that company has become more profitable and is now worth 25b the country’s balance of payments would look like this table 2balance of payments current account b imports 2170exports 800trade balance

1346b this money has left the county so foreign investors must now own this amount of the country’s capital the gain of 24b is wealth earned abroad and will come back through the fx market into the country’s private sector coffers it therefore offsets the capital account by the same amount are trade deficits always bad for a currency what happens to the currency will depend on how foreign investors view this economy if the deficit has grown because businesses are buying raw materials to grow the economy to add value to their produce and to build infrastructure it can be a positive in this case investors will be rushing to buy bonds and stocks in the country’s currency because the country is investing wisely in future growth it is a good risk investing in growth foreign investors are funding the imbalance temporarily while the economy is expanding they do this because they will probably gain a good return on those assets this will happen if the economy expands and the trade balance returns to surplus in the future think of this economy as a “growth stock” one that is reinvesting profits for rapid growth rather than handing out dividends to investors growth stocks are more risky but the rewards are high if the deficit has grown because businesses are buying raw materials to grow the economy to add value to their produce and to build infrastructure it can be a positive on the other hand if investors see that the deficit is a result of bad debt they will have a different view if the deficit is growing because of growth in consumer borrowing and spending on items like plasma tvs and game consoles rather than businesses investing for the future this is not likely to help the economy too much consumer debt and low saving rates can play a part in deficits because it enables individuals to spend beyond their means collectively that leads to imbalances in the economy this is “ dead money ” because it will not fuel future expansion without signs that the economy will grow foreign investors will start to sell the currency if that happens the country can try to support it by selling its foreign exchange reserves if it has any otherwise the currency will fall in value its stock market will fall and its bond yields will rise as foreign investors try to get their funds back this will correct the imbalance often abruptly the people of the country will end up poorer as a result their currency is worth less their imports will become more expensive causing inflation and they will have to pay more to borrow in the future figure 1 us bop accumulated trade deficit © forexop rebalancing of trade deficits when a country’s deficit becomes large and sustained over long periods it raises concerns because the fear is of abrupt corrections that may destabilize the economy or even the entire global financial system most trade deficits and surplus correct themselves over time by a combination of floating exchange rates and economic growth currencies that have fixed or controlled exchange rates are more vulnerable to financial shocks because the currency cannot adjust naturally and this creates unseen pressures that are very difficult to predict the collapse of the thai baht for example lead to the asian financial crisis in 1997 investors also worry the indebted country will purposely cause inflation to erode its debt either by printing money or quantitative easing when the currency devalues through inflation the deficit falls because the real value of the foreign holdings in the capital account falls the risks for these reasons holding cash or assets in currencies that have sustained large current account deficits is risky because the value of those assets may fall however the reward for investors taking that risk is future growth and an increase in asset value this is why the currencies of countries with trade surplus often rise when investors are risk averse risk capital tends to flow back to its source the u s trade deficit which swelled between 1998 and 2008 is starting to rebalance thanks to a number of factors from a steady weakening of the dollar to more homegrown energy which is lowering imports however china and other emerging economies still hold huge u s dollar foreign reserves which accumulated during the deficit years see figure 1  japan on the other hand is a strong exporter however a weak yen makes japan’s imports more expensive and adds to producer costs japan which is scarce of natural resources imports most of its energy and raw materials from other countries as a result since 2011 japan’s trade surplus has become a trade deficit figure 2 shows the change in japan’s trade balance along with the tradeweighted index of the yen currency the japanese have tried to encourage a weak yen to help their exports their ultra low interest rates have made the yen a choice of funding for carry trades causing traders to sell it in volume this has helped to keep the yen weak for a long time despite japan’s strong exports figure 2 japans trade balance © forexop bottom line on bo p data trade deficits are a normal part of a global economy and are not always bad however currency
