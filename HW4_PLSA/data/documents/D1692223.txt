and right sides at the back of the throat which can often be seen as fleshcolored pinkish lumps tonsils only present as white lumps if they are inflamed or infected with symptoms of exudates pus drainage and severe swelling tonsillitis is an inflammation of the tonsils and will often but not necessarily cause a sore throat and fever in chronic cases tonsillectomy may be indicated 3contents

hypertrophy4 additional images5 references6 external links structure  editthe palatine tonsils are located in the isthmus of the fauces between the palatoglossal arch and the palatopharyngeal arch of the soft palate the palatine tonsil is one of the mucosaassociated lymphoid tissues malt located at the entrance to the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts to protect the body from the entry of exogenous material through mucosal sites in consequence it is a site of and potential focus for infections and is one of the chief immunocompetent tissues in the oropharynx it forms part of the waldeyers ring which comprises the adenoid the paired tubal tonsils the paired palatine tonsils and the lingual tonsils from the pharyngeal side they are covered with a stratified squamous epithelium whereas a fibrous capsule links them to the wall of the pharynx through the capsule pass trabecules that contain small blood vessels nerves and lymphatic vessels these trabecules divide the tonsil into lobules blood supply and innervation  editthe nerves supplying the palatine tonsils come from the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve via the lesser palatine nerves and from the tonsillar branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve the glossopharyngeal nerve continues past the palatine tonsil and innervates the posterior 13 of the tongue to provide general and taste sensation this nerve is most likely to be damaged during a tonsillectomy which leads to reduced or lost general sensation and taste sensation to the posterior third of the tongue blood supply is provided by tonsillar branches of five arteries the dorsal lingual artery of the lingual artery  ascending palatine artery of the facial artery  tonsillar branch of the facial artery ascending pharyngeal artery of the external carotid artery  and the lesser palatine artery a branch of the descending palatine artery itself a branch of the maxillary artery  the tonsils venous drainage is by the peritonsillar plexus which drain into the lingual and pharyngeal veins which in turn drain into the internal jugular vein tonsillar crypts  editmain article tonsillar crypts lowpower microscope magnification of a crosssection through one of the tonsillar crypts running diagonally as it opens onto the surface of the throat at the top stratified epithelium e covers the throats surface and continues as a lining of the crypt beneath the surface are numerous nodules f of lymphoid tissue many lymph cells darkcolored region pass from the nodules toward the surface and will eventually mix with the saliva as salivary corpuscles s palatine tonsils consist of approximately 15 crypts which result in a large internal surface the tonsils contain four lymphoid compartments that influence immune functions namely the reticular crypt epithelium the extrafollicular area the mantle zones of lymphoid follicles and the follicular germinal centers in human palatine tonsils the very first part exposed to the outside environment is tonsillar epithelium function  editlocal immunity  editsee also tonsillectomy § impact on immune system tonsillar relating to palatine tonsil b cells can mature to produce all the five major immunoglobulin ig aka antibody classes furthermore when incubated in vitro with either mitogens or specific antigens they produce specific antibodies against diphtheria toxoid poliovirus streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae staphylococcus aureus and the lipopolysaccharide of e coli most immunoglobulin a produced by tonsillar b cells in vitro appears to be 7s monomers although a significant proportion may be l0s dimeric ig a in addition to humoral immunity elicited by tonsillar and adenoidal b cells following antigenic stimulation there is considerable tcell response in palatine tonsils thus natural infection or intranasal immunization with live attenuated rubella virus vaccine has been reported to prime tonsillar lymphocytes much better than subcutaneous vaccination also natural infection with varicella zoster virus has been found to stimulate tonsillar lymphocytes better than lymphocytes from peripheral blood investigation of potential copyright

section and div at the end of the portion you intend to blank altogether therefore several pieces of direct and indirect evidence indicate that the palatine tonsils are continuously engaged in local immune responses to microorganisms if the tonsillar lymphocytes became overwhelmed with this persistent stimulation they may be unable to respond to other antigens the immunological response particularly in recurrent tonsillitis may then be impaired once this immunological impairment occurs the tonsil is no longer able to function adequately in local protection nor can it appropriately reinforce the secretory immune system of the upper respiratory tract cytokine action  editcytokines are humoral immunomodulatory proteins or glycoproteins which control or modulate the activities of target cells resulting in gene activation leading to mitotic division growth and differentiation migration or apoptosis they are produced by wide range of cell types upon antigenspecific and nonantigen specific stimuli it has been reported by many studies that the clinic outcome of many infectious autoimmune or malignant diseases appears to be influenced by the overall balance of production profiles of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines therefore determination of cytokine profiles in tonsil study will provide key information for further indepth analysis of the cause and underlying mechanisms of these disorders as well as the role and possible interactions between the t and blymphocytes and other immunocompetent cells 4the cytokine network represents a very sophisticated and versatile regulatory system that is essential to the immune system for overcoming the various defense strategies of microorganisms through several studies the th1 and th2 cytokines and cytokine m rna are both detectable in tonsillar hypertrophy or obstructive sleep apnea osa and recurrent tonsillitis groups it showed that human palatine tonsil is an active immunological organ containing a wide range of cytokineproducing cells both th1 and th2 cells are involved in the pathophysiology of th and rt conditions indeed human tonsils persistently harbor microbial antigens even when the subject is asymptomatic of ongoing infection it could also be an effect of ontogeny of the immune system clinical significance  editthe pathogenesis of infectiousinflammatory disease in the tonsils most likely has its basis in their anatomic location and their inherent function as organ of immunity processing infectious material and other antigens and then becoming paradoxically a focus of infectioninflammation no single theory of pathogenesis has yet been accepted however viral infection with secondary bacterial invasion may be one mechanism of the initiation of chronic disease but the effects of the environment host factors the widespread use of antibiotics ecological considerations and diet all may play a role in children the tonsils are common sites of infections that may give rise to acute or chronic tonsillitis however it is still an open question whether tonsillar hypertrophy is also caused by a persistent infection tonsillectomy is one of the most common major operations performed on children the indications for the operation have been complicated by the controversy over the benefits of removing a chronically infected tissue and the possible harm caused by eliminating an important immune inductive tissue the information that is necessary to make a rational decision to resolve this controversy can be obtained by understanding the immunological potential of the normal palatine tonsils and comparing these functions with the changes that occur in the chronically diseased counterparts acute tonsillitis  edittonsillitis is the inflammation of tonsils acute tonsillitis is the most common manifestation of tonsillar disease it is associated with sore throat fever and difficulty swallowing the tonsils may appear normal sized or enlarged but are usually erythematous often but not always exudates can be seen not all these signs and symptoms are present in every patient recurrent tonsillitis  editrecurrent infection has been variably defined as from four to seven episodes of acute tonsillitis in one year five episodes for two consecutive years or three episodes per year for 3 consecutive years tonsillar hypertrophy  edittonsillar hypertrophy is the enlargement of the tonsils but without the history of inflammation obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy is currently the most common reason for tonsillectomy these patients present with varying degrees of disturbed sleep which may include symptoms of loud snoring irregular breathing nocturnal choking and coughing frequent awakenings sleep apnea dysphagia andor daytime hypersomnolence these may lead to behavioralmood changes in patients and facilitate the need for a polysomnography in order to determine the degree to which these symptoms are disrupting their sleep additional images
