habituation baby alexas brother fred has started screaming whenever he is left in his room for a nap the first few times this woke up from her own nap but now she sleeps right through it classical conditioning fred always jumps off his bed after his nap with a loud bang he then runs downstairs and greets alexa with a tickle making her laugh and cough reflexively soon alexa begins to laugh and cough when she hears the bang before seeing her brother statistical learning alexa lies in her crib while her father shows her a ladybug toy every 10 seconds or so he takes the toy away for a few seconds and then puts it over her head again each time alexa looks again at the ladybug about the 10th time her father drops the ladybug by mistake and the dog runs off with it but alexa continues to look for the toy to appear operant instrumental conditioning alexa randomly makes many vocalizations throughout the day her coos elicit laughter and hugging from her parents and this seems to make her cooing more frequent observational learning when alexa sees her big brother fred banging on a drum she starts beating her hand on the tray of her highchair as if it is a drumperceptual learning alexas family has lots of photos on the wall and one of these is of alexas mom and aunt who look a lot alike when alexa is 3 months old she looks equally long at the two women in the photo but by 6 months of age alexa spends more time looking at her mothers face in the photo than that of her aunt how change in a particular skill occurs naturalistic observation all of the above whether a particular culture prized independence or interdependence among people whether it is common for mothers of young children to work outside home whether a child comes from a poor versus middleincome family if the vast majority of people in a society believe something it does not need to be tested mannys quiet nature influences him to seek out other quiet children with whom he plays quiet games and stays away from the more rambunctious children in his class validity group assignment whether they were trained in the new game or not a childs entry into a new stage involves a gradual shift from one way of experiencing the world to a different way of experiencing it the interaction of nature and nurture an experimental design clinical interview structured interview interrater reliability direction of

governmental policy contribute to the differences in the number of male and female babies born in some societies specialization of eye cells cells are initially flexible and then become inflexible flexibility ginas infant is likely to be more active than margarets infant fetal learning has learned to recognize a stimulus when a saccharindye combination was injected into the amniotic fluid of some fetuses and dye only was injected into the amniotic fluid of other fetuses the urine of the saccharin mothers contained more dye than the urine of the nosaccharin mothersinitial changes in heart
