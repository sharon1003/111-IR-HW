category 5 monster storm it was the most destructive hurricane to hit the united states in fact it did more damage than any other natural disaster in u s history it was massive before it even made landfall its hurricane force winds reached 75 nautical miles east of the center its maximum winds stretched 25 to 30 nautical miles it forced the evacuation of 75 percent of the 819 manned oil platforms in the gulf of mexico that reduced oil production by a third but it did most of its damage after it hit louisiana on august 29 2005 that was after the national hurricane center reclassified down to a category 3 hurricane it impacted 93000 square miles its storm surge crested at 27 feet the facts on hurricane katrinas damage insurance and other costs hurricane katrina cost a staggering 108 billion insurance covered only 80 billion of the losses but university of north texas professor bernard weinstein estimated that katrina cost 250 billion that includes both the damage and its economic impact he estimated uninsured losses at 215 billion and insured losses at 35 billion thats because the worst flooding occurred in new orleans 9th ward it was a lowincome are that was mostly uninsured these facts were discussed at the university during katrina’s third anniversary on august 28 2008 flooding in new orleans caused half the damage it destroyed or rendered uninhabitable 300000 homes it left in its wake 118 million cubic yards of debris that made cleanup efforts a mindboggling attempt oil costs katrina damaged 19 percent of u s oil production it destroyed 113 offshore oil and gas platforms when combined with hurricane rita which followed soon afterward they damaged 457 oil and gas pipelines and spilled almost as much oil as the exxon valdez disaster that caused oil prices to increase by 3 a barrel gas prices almost reached 5 a gallon in response the u s government released oil from the strategic petroleum reserves  katrinas impact is reflected in historical oil prices the cost to the u s economy the u s economy grew 38 percent in the quarter before katrina hit afterward it plummeted to 13 percent in the fourth quarter from october to december thats when production losses such as gas pipe disruptions showed up the economy was healthy enough to shake it off according to the national accounts of the bureau of economic analysis it returned to a robust 48 percent growth rate in gross domestic product by the first quarter in 2006 the toll on humans and pets of more importance was the impact on people and animals katrina displaced 770000 residents thats more than the dust bowl migration during the great depression seventyfive thousand returned only to find their homes destroyed katrinas death toll was 1836 people old age was a contributing factor of those who died 71 percent were 60 years or older half of them were 75 or more there were 68 in nursing homes possibly abandoned by their caretakers two hundred bodies went unclaimed over 700 people were unaccounted for the storm killed or made homeless 600000 pets what went wrong katrina was devastating because of its path its 28foot storm surge exposed engineering mistakes in new orleans levees it destroyed 169 miles of the 350mile system that flooded 80 percent of the city floodwaters did not recede for weeks some neighborhoods were eradicated and never recovered if the levees had held flooding would have been reduced by twothirds the u s army corps of engineers did not update all the levees with concrete support pilings some levees were not high enough others were built on soil that crumbled under the flooding why did katrina damage the economy so much the hurricane caused 260 million in damage to new orleans port although it was open to ships a week later the citys tourism industry generated 96 billion a year before katrina it attracted 71 million visitors each year it only received 26 million tourists in 2006 katrina struck the heart of louisianas sugar industry and destroyed 40 percent of the crop the american sugar cane league estimated the annual crop value at 500 million this area of louisiana had 50 chemical plants producing 25 percent of the nations chemicals the nearby mississippi coast was home to 12 casinos which took in 13 billion each year the storm also damaged oyster beds and the local shrimping industry how katrinas damage compares to other natural disasters katrinas extensive damage was unusual typically hurricanes that hit the densely populated east coast cause the most damage thats because there is a concentration of expensive highrise buildings hurricane harvey hovered over houston for three days it dropped 51 inches of rain the most for a single storm in the continental united states hurricane irma was a category 5 storm when it hit puerto rico on september 7 2017 it was a category 4 when it hit key west florida it was the largest atlantic storm ever its 185 mph winds lasted for 37 hours a new record its was fed by 86 degree water unusually warm for the atlantic if irma had hit miami the damage could have reached 300 billion according to insurance firm swiss re global warming could create more hurricanes the size of katrina thats because warmer temperatures allow the atmosphere to hold more moisture rising sea levels make flooding more likely near gulf coast cities global warming has stalled weather patterns in the gulf region
