report s panswers from chico on september 08 2009hi l has your toddler had a chest xray does she get the blue lips when she is really active i would request a chest xray just in case it is a heart issue our daughter had dilated cardiomyopathy and although your daughter probably does not in all honesty the odds are really against it  12 out of every million or something and we would have never known it but she got a respiratory infection and they xrayed her chest to check her lungs and her heart was really big its better if they can catch it earlyand its no harm to rule it out i just think its better to be safe  and heart defects often go unnoticed until the child gets really sick i know that my daughters lips used to turn blue because of poor circulation issues i know this is a long shot and im sure your daughter is fine but i would at least ask for the chest xrays helpful yes  no share report s sanswers from san francisco on september 02 2009my daughters lips did the same thing and it freaked me out i noticed one time they were really blue shes mixed so it really stood out and then took a nap and presto her lips went back to their normal color it become one of my many ways
