of love it was written by hendrix and recorded at electric lady studios on july 23rd 1970 1 2 with drummer mitch mitchell and bassist billy cox – the cry of love 3angel was released as a posthumous single in the united kingdom and germany in march 1971 backed with  night bird flying  and  freedom  respectively the song also featured as the bside to the freedom single released in the united states and others on march 8th 1971 3contents  showhistory edit jimis handwritten lyrics for angel it can be assumed that hendrix wrote the music for angel as early as 1967 as it first appeared in the form of a demo for  little wing  recorded at olympic sound studios on october 14 4 the song became angel not long after this when the first recording under the name sweet angel took place just one month later 4 both said recordings appear on the 1997 compilation south saturn delta under their respective titles the lyrics for angel were written early in 1968 3 being completed on january 14 5 they were somewhat different from those used on the final version though similar to the sweet angel recording of 1967 the title written by hendrix for the lyrics was my angel catherina return of little wing suggesting that the metaphorical female subject of little wing is the same as that of angel the next version of angel was recorded by hendrix alone on guitar and vocals in a hotel room in early possibly february 2 1968 this recording — which is often incorrectly labelled as not bieng acoustic — was featured on many bootlegs and a few official recordings including acoustic jams live  unreleased and jimi by himself the home recordings the lyrics for this clean version were more similar to the original ones written in 1968 than those used on the final version after apparently leaving the song for over two years hendrix mitch mitchell and billy cox  the cry of love recorded the final version of angel on july 23 1970 1 3 2 a few days after the session hendrix recited the song as a piece of poetry to friend freddie mae gautier during a conversation about his mother lucille in an interview for electric gypsy mae described angel as very deep it was what was in him 6 angel was mixed for hendrixs first rays of the new rising sun project over august 20 and 21 1970 7 which included the overdubbing of a second guitar part when hendrix passed away mae took it upon herself to read the poem — as well as hendrixs liner notes to the buddy miles express album expressway to your skull — at the musicians funeral 8 on october 1 1970 9angel was first featured as the eighth song on the first posthumous studio release the cry of love 3 26 years later it was included on first rays of the new rising sun 10 argued by many to be the most accurate approximation of jimis intended final project as well as the aforementioned first rays attempts angel also appeared on a number of popular compilation albums released between hendrixs death and the present day including voodoo child the jimi hendrix collection 11 the singles album 12 and the ultimate experience 13 14analysis edit meaning editangel was inspired by a dream hendrix had about his mother lucille 15 16 a primary source of inspiration for hendrixs songs dreams often featured his mother or a similar mother figure and a similar dream he had two years before her death in 1958 essentially predicted her demise 17 in a similar light to  drifting   night bird flying  and  in from the storm  angel is proof of how important to hendrix a mother figure was to save him from isolation and loneliness 6style edit the song is a mellow blues composition which features classically elaborative chord work from hendrix and purposely restrained drumming from the usually firey mitchell the guitars are clean and compliment the droning style of singing well creating the poetic ballad that is angel lyrics edit angel came down from heaven yesterday she stayed with me just long enough to rescue me and she told me a story yesterday about the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea and then she spread her wings high over me she said shes gonna come back tomorrow and i said fly on my sweet angel fly on through the sky fly on my sweet angel tomorrow im gonna be by your side sure enough this morning came unto me silver wings silhouette against the childs sunrise and my angel she said unto me today is the day for you to rise take my hand youre gonna be my man youre gonna rise and then she took me high over yonder lord and i said fly on my sweet angel fly on through the sky fly on my sweet angel forever i will be by your side clean version angel come down from heaven yesterday she stayed with me just long enough for afternoon tea and she tell me a story yesterday about the love between the moon and the deep blue sea and when it was time for her to go she spread her wings high over me and she said i shall return tomorrow and i said fly on my sweet angel fly on through the sky fly on my sweet angel tomorrow i will feel you by my side and sure enough this morning comes to me well silverwing silhouette against a glow of the childs sunrise and as the bluebirds and the sparrows envy me she says i love you little boy and today you shall fly she kissed me once and the feeling so good she made me cry and now well fly together and i said fly on my sweet angel fly on through the sky fly
