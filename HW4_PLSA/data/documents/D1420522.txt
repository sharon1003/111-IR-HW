abaloneby jacqueline m newman fish and seafood fall volume 2002 issue 9 3 page s 5 and 24the chinese hold several animal species in high regard the abalone a member of the haliotidaee family is certainly one of them as such and due to its limited supply it commands a high price and is beloved on special occasions and certainly at almost all festival times there was a time when only royalty really knew this special food item common folk thought they did but most of them just knew to speak about them rich or poor titled or ordinary who would think when looking at their ugly shells that a delicious fleshy interior hid within the inside of those ugly shells has a magnificent luminescent interior once these mollusks were only available fresh but about two hundred years ago they became available canned and since then their availability and use has increased in addition to canned abalone there are now many new products that use them and so everyday use of the abalone is becoming more commonplace considered one of eight valuable sea foods abalone was known to be special in the ming dynasty 1368 to 1644 ce and maybe even long before that it belongs in a class almost as important as sharks fin and bird’s nest and other ingredients of that caliber considered pu or heating as are most animal foods this particular animal lives in a topsided multiholed shell there can be up to nine of these holes and they are always in a straight line from hinge to end only the largest of them is used for breathing some are used for reproductive purposes and others are for ridding the animal of its waste if the shell is slightly ajar you can often see their antennae sticking out they are attached to the body of the animal which is better known as its muscle from fertilization of the egg to maturity can take up to eight years so though more are available there is a somewhat limited supply of this algaeeating creature when it is young and seaweedeating animal when it gets older not all abalone are alike there are more than one hundred different species each of which lives at different depths and many consume different species of algae and seaweed as well the abalone is temperature sensitive and a change in it does have an impact on its development most of the ones we eat fresh or canned are harvested in the wild so they truly are in limited supply because of this some countries regulate the amount that can be harvested some only allow those taken off the rocks and by hand gathering them is no easy task because if this mollusk senses danger it attaches itself so tightly that to remove it means cut hands and up to five hundred pounds of energy where are they harvested you ask most are found in australia which is reported to be the world’s largest supplier the black lip variety their largest species others are from canada europe japan mexico in the middle east new zealand south africa and of course in the waters of china and taiwan japan and mexico probably produce the largest supply of dried abalone not only are abalone dried and canned and used fresh they are now available frozen unfortunately both dried and frozen they can be tasteless hard or both and it is extremely difficult to tell when looking at them so one needs to buy from a trusted supplier if dried or frozen and from a company whose products you know when purchasing these low calorie critters when canned to complete the nutrition picture three and a half ounces of abalone has about eight calories is a good source of proteineighteen grams to be specific has lots of potassium 230 mg and is low in cholesterol 60 mg and the abalone has almost no fat the chinese believe that abalone it not only gently heating but also moist in chinese medicine it is known as shijeh ming the chhinese believe it good for the immune system valuable as an adjunct therapy for cancer and a brightener and healer for the eyes they also advise that abalone increases appetite and is a health food for the liver and kidneys many purchase oyster flavored sauce made from an oyster extract are they aware that there is also an abalone flavored sauce found in a lookalike bottle made in a very similar fashion for those who adore gilding the lily so to speak look for a canned product called whole sharks fin in abalone sauce for those who purchase their abalone frozen defrost it in the refrigerator and wash it to get rid of any sand then pound it both before and after slicing it that tenderizes the muscle if you like to purchase it dried to get the best results soak it for two or three days keep it covered and in the refrigerator and change the water several times each day some varieties of dried abalone need steaming for up to ten hours most of these were dried months and months ago purchasing abalone canned saves all of these efforts and is therefore the easiest to use it does need rinsing in several changes of water before and after slicing it we like to prepare it in stewed dishes cook it with pork on or off the bone cook it in abalone or oyster sauce and often we add wine and a mite of sugar when cooking our abalone how long to cook abalone even canned abalone varies considerably if you use fresh abalone steam it for ten minutes to three hours testing with a fork every ten to fifteen minutes it is not unusual to need even more than three hours if the abalone you are working with is tough all of these efforts can help when trying to understand why dishes made with abalone are expensive in restaurants reserved for special occasions and not cooked very often even at home there are newer ways to work with this specialty item and we have selected recipes both for taste and for ease of preparation always using canned abalone or abalone sauce canned abalone is easy to purchase abalone sauce less so so if it is unavailable where you live substitute oyster sauce we hope that you will try them and that you will begin to enjoy this wonderful special chinese food
