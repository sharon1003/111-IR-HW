home Â» trust and estates are there time limits in will probate by matthew mac kenzie following a persons death his estate is divided through a process known as probate in probate the court will essentially prove the will and determine its validity if the deceased person decedent passed away without a valid will the probate process is longer and more complicated having a valid will helps probate run smoother and most times the probate court will follow the wishes indicated in the will however in most states there are time limits for processing a decedents will with the proper probate court time frame time limits usually begin following the decedents date of death and vary from state to state for example in montana the time limit for probate is 3 years following the decedents death in ohio however the time limit is much longer at 20 years following the decedents death some states such as california have no time limits for filing a will for probate it is important to check the correct states estate laws in order to determine such limits while probating a will may still be possible after the time limit has expired depending on the decedents state law the process will likely be more complicated and expensive filing a will for probate filing a decedents will for probate is a relatively simple process first you will have to file an application with the proper probate court along with an application fee second the court will seek to appoint a personal representative usually the person named in the will who will administer all matters of the estate third the pending estate will be published to the general public announcing the will in probate finally if the will is not contested the appointed personal representative will then carry out all matters according to the will if a will is contested hearings and additional time limits will be ordered by the court in order to correctly address the decedents wishes types of probate types of probate also vary from state to state however most states have different probates for small estates nonprobated wills and large estates involving protective proceedings and trusts while there are many factors involved three large factors to determine the type of probate involved are the complexity of the will amount of assets and type of estate effects on probate without a will if a decedent dies without a will the probate process is vastly different states have different laws regarding how much and what exactly each heir will take of the decedents estate typically immediate family such as children and parents will take a majority of the estate and the rest will be divided down the line proportionally with extended family suggestions estate planning and wills are a specialized area of the law and the laws vary greatly from state to state therefore it is wise to seek the advice of an attorney who deals in the particular area to assist in the probate process about the author matthew mac kenzie has been a writer for over eight years he attended the university of montana and majored in political science mackenzie received his juris doctor from st thomas university and is a licensed lawyer his work has been published on various websites cite this article
