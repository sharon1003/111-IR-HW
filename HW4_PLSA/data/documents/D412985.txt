source shttpsshrinkima9vj zpeplinski · 1 year ago0 0 comment yup all tattoos hurt but my feet were more painful that most of the other spots they also got swollen afterwards and i had to take care to stay off of my feet for a few days i had both done at the same time larger pieces on each my artist also warned me to be very careful of infection i guess the feet are more prone and i have cats so she was concerned about the litter and the kitties tracking it over the house if your other question was how long do the tattoos last on your feet the obvious answer is forever but the feet are more

answers search on this site httpsshorturlimavv rj you said you have low pain tolerance but youre not concern if youre going to be allergic to the ink used in tats if you dont think youll get an allergic reactions to the ink the fda have gotten reports from people who have and have read it several times on ya tattoos some tattoo colors are harder to remove than others laser treatments can turn some tattoos darker instead of lighter or change them to a different color the same goes for permanent makeup which is a kind of tattoo it depends on what ingredients went into the tattoo ink to produce the color but it can be hard to find out whats in tattoo inks because they usually dont have ingredients listed on the label very often even the tattooist doesnt know whats in the tattoo ink because the company that made it considers the formula proprietary propryuhtaree that means its a trade secret here are some more facts about tattoos • fda has not approved any color additives for injection into your skin • people who get a tattoo should not give blood for a year afterward because of the chance of infection • although it happens only very rarely some people may have an allergic reaction to the dyes used for tattooing imagine being allergic to something thats been injected into your skin • or the tattooist may make a mistake who wants to wear someone elses mistake forever speaking of forever how often do you change your mind about your hair your earrings or the clothes you like to wear its not so easy when you change your mind about a tattoo although many temporary tattoos are legal some  especially some of those imported from other countries  are illegal in the united states because they use color additives that are not approved for use on the skin fda has had reports of people having allergic reactions to temporary tattoos what about henna temporary tattoos henna is a brown to reddish brown dye made from a plant it is approved only for use on the hair not the skin if it is black or any other color besides brown or reddish brown it contains other ingredients it also may contain other ingredients to make the stain darker make the skin absorb the color more easily or make the stain last longer could these ingredients hurt you it depends individuals are different and may be sensitive to different things if you dont know what the ingredients are its impossible to tell what they might do if you put them on your skin mariana · 2 years ago0 0 commenti just got a foot tattoo on this past tuesday increasing my number of tats to 4 i didnt have any problem with swelling or trouble walking on my foot its doing great and healing well because i am using raven tattoo care cream it hurt yes because it was a tattoo but it wasnt anything that you couldnt handle i actually didnt mind the pain but i guess everyone is different but if it is what you really want then i say go for it because if you want it bad enough pain wouldnt be an issue

because it is on the bone altho i thaught it was most painful on the ankle rather than the front on the foot dont use a numbing cream because that interferes with the skin tone which can lead to fading of the tattoo it also depends on how big the tattoo u want is if its small then it will only be around 10minutes os pain but its bearable pain get a friend to go with u its always better to tlk to someone while its happeneing its pain that is bearable tho  x x xstuntgirl · 1 decade ago1 0 comment i have one on each foot and they take up my whole foot i have a high threshold for pain so they
