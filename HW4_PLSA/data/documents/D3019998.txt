allergic reactions atopic dermatitis drowsiness anaphylaxis illustrations allergy symptoms allergic rhinitis recognizing invader indepth from a d a m medications antihistamines histamine is one of the chemicals released when antibodies overreact to allergens it is the cause of many symptoms of allergic rhinitis antihistamines can help relieve itching sneezing and runny nose unless combined with a decongestant antihistamines do not work well for relieving nasal congestion other allergy symptoms unrelated to rhinitis including hives and some rashes if possible patients should take antihistamines before an anticipated allergy attack many antihistamines are available they include shortacting and longacting forms and come in oral pill and nasal spray forms antihistamines are generally categorized as first and secondgeneration firstgeneration antihistamines which include diphenydramine benadryl and clemastine tavist cause more severe side effects such as drowsiness than most newer secondgeneration antihistamines for this reason secondgeneration antihistamines are generally preferred and recommended over firstgeneration antihistamines there are some notes of caution when taking any antihistamine antihistamines may thicken mucus secretions and can worsen bacterial rhinitis or sinusitis antihistamines can lose their effectiveness over time and a different one may need to be tried secondgeneration antihistaminesare sometimes referred to collectively as nonsedating antihistamines however cetirizine zyrtec and the nasal spray antihistamines astelin patanase can cause drowsiness when taken at recommended doses loratidine claritin alavert and desloratadine clarinex can cause drowsiness when taken at doses exceeding the recommended dose brand names secondgeneration antihistamines in pill form include loratadine claritin alavert claritin is available overthecounter and is approved for children ages 2 and older claritind combines the antihistamine with a the decongestant pseudoephedrine desloratadine clarinex is similar to claritin but stronger and longerlasting it is available only by prescription cetirizine zyrtec zyrtec is approved for both indoor and outdoor allergies it is the only antihistamine to date approved for infants as young as 6 months it is available overthecounter zyrtecd is a pill that combines the antihistamine with the decongestant pseudoephedrine fexofenadine allegra is also available overthecounter acrivastine and pseudoephedrine semprexd is a pill that combines an antihistamine and decongestant secondgeneration antihistamines in nasal form are as good as or better than the oral forms for treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis however they can cause drowsiness and are not as effective for allergic rhinitis as nasal corticosteroids nasal spray antihistamines are available by prescription and include azelastine astelin asteprooloptadine patanaseside effects and precautions common side effects include headache dry mouth and dry nose these are often only temporary and go away during treatment drowsiness occurs in about 10 of adults and in 2  4 of children the nasal spray forms of secondgeneration antihistamines cause more drowsiness than the pill forms uncommon side effects include rapid heart beat and chest tightness tell your doctor if these effects occur extendedrelease forms of claritin and zyrtec have other ingredients that can cause other symptoms including nervousness restlessness and insomnia nasal corticosteroids corticosteroids help reduce the inflammatory response associated with allergic reactions nasalspray corticosteroids commonly called steroids are considered the most effective drugs for controlling the symptoms of moderatetosevere allergic rhinitis they are often used either alone or in combination with secondgeneration oral antihistamines the benefits of nasal spray steroids include reducing inflammation and mucus production improving night sleep and daytime alertness in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis treating polyps in the nasal passages nasalspray brands corticosteroids available in nasal spray form include triamcinolone nasacort approved for children over age 2 mometasone furoate nasonex approved for use in patients age 3 and older fluticasone flonase flounce veramyst generic approved for children over age 2 beclomethasone beconase vancenase approved for children over age 6 flunisolide nasalideapproved for children over age 6 budesonide rhinocort approved for children over age 6 ciclesonide omnaris approved for patients age 12 and older side effects corticosteroids are powerful antiinflammatory drugs although oral steroids can have many side effects the nasalspray form affects only local areas and has less risk for widespread side effects unless the drug is used excessively side effects of nasal steroids may include dryness burning stinging in the nasal passage sneezing headaches and nosebleed uncommon but should be reported to your doctor immediatelypossible longterm complications all corticosteroids suppress stress hormones this effect is known to produce some serious longterm complications in people who take oral steroids researchers have found far fewer concerns with nasal administration or inhaled forms but there may be certain problems effect on growth the major concern for children is whether nasal steroids like other forms of steroids will adversely affect growth different steroids may be absorbed differently or may stay longer in the body growth impairment from nasal corticosteroid sprays taken at correct dosages has not been demonstrated most children who take only recommended dosages of nasal sprays and do not also take inhaled corticosteroids for asthma will not have any problems effect on eyes glaucoma is a known side effect of oral steroids some ophthalmologists have observed higher pressure in the eye a sign of glaucoma in some patients taking nasal steroid sprays particularly those taking higher dosages or those who also take inhaled corticosteroids for asthma however studies to date have not shown an increased risk for glaucoma periodic eye examinations are advised use during pregnancy steroids are most likely safe during pregnancy but pregnant women should talk to their doctors before taking them nasal passage injury steroid sprays may injure the nasal septum the bony area that separates the nasal passage if the spray is directed onto it this complication is very rare lower resistance to infection people with any infectious disease or injury in the nose should not take these drugs until the disease or wound has been treated and cured cromolyn cromolyn serves as both an antiinflammatory drug and a specific blocker for allergens the standard cromolyn nasal spray nasalcrom is not as effective as steroid nasal sprays but does work well for many people with mild allergies it is one of the preferred firstline therapies for pregnant women with mild allergic rhinitis it may take up to 3 weeks to experience full benefit side effects cromolyn has no major side effects but minor ones include nasal congestion coughing sneezing wheezing nausea nosebleeds and dry throat the spray can cause burning or irritation leukotriene antagonists leukotriene antagonists are oral drugs that block leukotrienes powerful immune system factors that are important in causing airway constriction and mucus production in allergyrelated asthma they appear to work as well as antihistamines for treatment of allergic rhinitis but are not as effective as nasal corticosteroids leukotriene antagonists include zafirlukast accolate and montelukast singulair these drugs are mainly used to treat asthma montelukast was approved in 2003 to treat seasonal allergies and in 2005 to treat indoor allergies the fda is currently reviewing these drugs to see whether they are associated with behavior and mood changes and suicidal thoughts patients who take these drugs should be monitored for signs of mood deterioration decongestants decongestants work by shrinking blood vessels in the nose many overthecounter decongestants are available either in tablet form or as nasal or inhaled decongestants that are applied directly into the airways as sprays drops or vapors nasaldelivery decongestants nasaldelivery decongestants are applied directly into the nasal passages with a spray gel drops or vapors nasal decongestants come in longacting or shortacting forms the effects of shortacting decongestants last about 4 hours longacting decongestants last 6  12 hours the active ingredients in nasal decongestants include oxymetazoline xylometazoline and phenylephrine nasal forms work faster than oral decongestants and may not cause as much drowsiness however they can cause dependency and rebound the major hazard with nasaldelivery decongestants particularly longacting forms is a cycle of dependency and rebound effects the 12hour brands pose a particular risk for this effect with prolonged use more than 3  5 days nasal decongestants lose effectiveness and can cause swelling in the nasal passages the patient then increases the frequency of the dose as the congestion worsens the patient may respond with even more frequent doses this causes dependency and increased nasal congestion the following precautions are important for people taking nasal decongestants when using a nasal spray spray each nostril once wait a minute to allow absorption into the mucosal tissues and then spray again do not share droppers and inhalers with other people discard sprayers inhalers or other decongestant delivery devices when the medication is no longer needed over time these devices can become reservoirs for bacteria discard the medicine if it becomes cloudy or unclear do not use nasal decongestants for longer than three days oral decongestants oral decongestants also come in many brands which have similar ingredients the most common active ingredients are pseudoephedrine sudafed actifed drixoral and phenylephrine sometimes in combination with an antihistamine oral decongestants can cause side effects such as insomnia irritability nervousness and heart palpitations taking pseudoephedrine in the morning as opposed to later in the day or before bedtime can help patients avoid these side effects individuals at risk for complications from decongestants people who may be at higher risk for complications are those with certain medical conditions including disorders that make blood vessels highly susceptible to contraction such conditions include heart disease high blood pressure thyroid disease diabetes prostate problems that cause urinary difficulties migraines raynauds phenomenon high sensitivity to cold emphysema or chronic bronchitis individuals with these conditions should particularly avoid highpotency shortacting nasal decongestant medications that increase serotonin levels such as certain antidepressants antimigraine drugs diet pills st johns wort and methamphetamine the combination of these medicines and decongestants can cause blood vessels in the brain to narrow suddenly causing severe headaches and even stroke anyone with these conditions should not use oral or nasal decongestants without a doctors guidance other people who should not use decongestants without first consulting a doctor include pregnant women children children appear to metabolize decongestants differently than adults decongestants should not be used at all in infants and children under the age of 4 years and some doctors recommend not giving them to children under the age of 14 children are at particular risk for central nervous system side effects including convulsions rapid heart rates loss of consciousness and death nasal ipratropium ipratropium bromide atrovent is a prescription nasal spray that can help relieve runny nose it works best when given in combination with a nasal corticosteroid side effects include nasal dryness nosebleeds and sore throat it should not be used by people who have glaucoma or men who have an enlarged prostate gland more information on this topic background causes symptoms risk factors
