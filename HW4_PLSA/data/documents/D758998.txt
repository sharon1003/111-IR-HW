how a heat pump works how they work heat pumps use electricity to capture heat and move it from one place to another they dont generate heat as the pool pump circulates the swimming pools water the water drawn from the pool passes through a filter and the heat pump heater the heat pump heater has a fan that draws in the outside air and directs it over the evaporator coil liquid refrigerant within the evaporator coil absorbs the heat from the outside air and becomes a gas the warm gas in the coil then passes through the compressor the compressor increases the heat creating a very hot gas that then passes through the condenser the condenser transfers the heat from the hot gas to the cooler pool water circulating through the heater the heated water then returns to the pool the hot gas as it flows through the condenser coil returns to liquid form and back to the evaporator where the whole process begins again higher efficiency heat pump pool heaters usually use scroll compressors versus the reciprocal compressors of standard units heat pump pool heaters work efficiently as long as the outside temperature remains above the 45ºf–50ºf range the cooler the outside air they draw in the more energy they use however since most people use outdoor swimming pools during warm and mild weather this usually isnt an issue selecting a heat pump pool heater heat pump pool heaters cost more than gas pool heaters but they typically have much lower annual operating costs because of their higher efficiencies with proper maintenance heat pump pool heaters typically last longer than gas pool heaters therefore youll save more money in the long run when selecting a heat pump pool heater you should consider its size efficiency costs sizing a heat pump pool heater you should have a trained pool professional perform a proper sizing analysis for your specific swimming pool to determine pool heater size sizing a heat pump pool heater involves many factors basically a heater is sized according to the surface area of the pool and the difference between the pool and the average air temperatures other factors also affect the heating load for outdoor pools such as wind exposure humidity levels and cool night temperatures therefore pools located in areas with higher average wind speeds at the pool surface lower humidity and cool nights will require a larger heater heat pump pool heaters are rated by btu output and horsepower hp standard sizes include 35 hp75000 btu 5 hp100000 btu and 6 hp125000 btu to calculate an approximate heater size for an outdoor swimming pool follow these steps determine your desired swimming pool temperature determine the average temperature for the coldest month of pool use subtract the average temperature for the coldest month from the desired pool temperature this will give you the temperature rise needed calculate the pool surface area in square feet use the following formula to determine the btuhour output requirement of the heater pool area x temperature rise x 12this formula is based on 1º to 114ºf temperature rise per hour and a 312 mile per hour average wind at the pool surface for a 112ºf rise multiply by 15 for a 2ºf rise multiply by 20 determining heat pump swimming pool heater efficiency the energy efficiency of heat pump swimming pool heaters is measured by coefficient of performance cop the higher the cop number the more efficient however there is no standard test for measuring the cop therefore you really cant compare the cops of different models unless you know that the manufacturers used the same test for each model for example the same heat pump will operate at a higher cop when the outside air temperature is higher typically manufacturers measure the cop by testing a heat pump pool heater with an outdoor temperature of 80ºf and pool temperature of 80ºf cops usually range from 30 to 70 which converts to an efficiency of 300–700 this means that for every unit of electricity it takes to runs the compressor you get 3–7 units of heat out of the heat pump estimating heat pump swimming pool heater costs and savings for an outdoor swimming pool use the following tables to help estimate your annual heat pump pool heater costs and savings compared to using an electric resistance or a gas pool heater table 1 estimates annual swimming heat pump pool heating costs by location by water
