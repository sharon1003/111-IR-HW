the 11 best microphones for you tube vlogging 2018audiotechnica at2020the most important thing you will need for vlogging is a good microphone the camera comes in second place after all nobody will follow you if they can’t hear you well so it’s an important step to become a successful vlogger here are the 11 best microphones for you tube vlogging no matter what kind of camera you’re planning to use i included each of the types of microphones you might be interested in according to your needs i’ve separated them according to their utility and nature you can use the table of contents to navigate through the different sections i will start with a really short explanation about the different types of microphones this way you can understand which one is the best you tube microphone for your needs table of contents  showwhy you should avoid builtin camera microphones most cameras have a builtin mic so a lot of people tend to think that this is enough to start recording good video it is not the main problem with builtin microphones is that they are on the consumer level in other words they’re low quality it’s not just that their sound is not clear but rather they capture every single sound around you including air they are noisy and can’t discriminate any sound this happens because they are omnidirectional the recorded ambient sound can get louder than your voice unless you put the mic near you there are some omnidirectional microphones that are worth but only if the situation calls for it why unidirectional mics are the best you tube microphones source wikipedia you want to get a unidirectional or bidirectional microphone if you don’t want to record everything that is happening outside your window nobody wants to hear the sound of a truck passing by your house or the neighborhood kids cleverly insulting each other right the most common type of unidirectional microphone is the cardioid these are microphones made for speech and they will only record sound coming from one direction these are the best you will find for vlogging finally there are mainly 3 kinds of microphones you will find when looking for the best microphone for vlogging condenser microphones these are microphones that convert acoustic sounds into electrical signals they’re often used to record music but they are also popular for speech source wikipedia there are 2 kinds of condenser mics that are interesting for vlogging lavalier microphones these are really small microphones that you can clip to your clothing they are useful when you don’t want to face a static microphone when speaking these microphones are omnidirectional but the noise is easy to suppress since they’re attached close to your mouth you can hide them in your clothing but you won’t be able to move around because the microphone will capture the sound of your clothing rubbing against it the best way to use them is by clipping them to the external part of your clothing like this source wikipedia shotgun microphones these are the most common microphones that can be connected to your dslr they have a really narrow area to capture sound in the front and they cancel sound waves that come from other directions they don’t amplify sound like most people think they just have a very narrow sensitive area to capture the sound waves that approach their front end they are really good for recording from a long distance source wikipedia now let’s start with the lists i’ve put a lot of effort in getting rid of microphones you won’t need for vlogging and also those that are not worth the price we’ll start with usb microphones these ones are very popular mics for you tube vlogging and for good reasons the 3 best usb microphones for you tube most you tubers will want to get a really cheap webcam that can record top quality video —see my post the 6 best webcams for youtube vlogging — and combine it with a good usb microphone this is a good idea since webcams are so cheap and the most important thing you should worry about is sound these are also the best microphones for you tube gaming as you can record directly to your pc and sync video and audio easily in general usb microphones are great for anyone that’s looking to record videos in front of their pc there are some really good and popular options for usb mics to connect to your pc or even dslr blue snowball there is no reason to go for a cheaper microphone than the blue snowball even if you don’t have the money right now you should wait for a sale or save money until you can buy it this is the best priced microphone you can get to record sound to your pc most people even prefer to save more money and get a higher quality blue yeti microphone nevertheless you can’t go wrong with a snowball that’s why it’s still popular between streamers and vloggers with this microphone you will be able to switch between 2 modes omnidirectional and cardioid one last thing to say about it is that it comes in different colors this is cool if you want to show it on your videos or simply for personal taste one alternative to this microphone is the samson meteor mic usb studio microphone the main difference is that the snowball has better audio quality but the meteor includes headphones jack mute switch and volume controls also it’s smaller which some people find useful the best budget usb microphone alternative to the snowball is the samson go mic you can still choose between cardioid and omnidirectional with it but its recording quality is lower consider that its price is not that different from the snowball’s still although i would save for the snowball i do admit that the quality of the samson is fair for the price blue yeti this is the bestseller usb condenser microphone on amazon it is also pretty common between you tubers it offers a wide variety of soundcapturing pattern modes and its sound quality is pretty good for the price you can choose between cardioid bidirectional omnidirectional and stereo the stereo mode is close to the omnidirectional but it’s more selective it just allows sound from the right and left to give the surrounding effect nevertheless you will most likely use the cardioid mode for vlogging whether you should get something better than a blue yeti or not it will depend on how much money you have available microphones get to a point where the more you pay the better sound you get you won’t sacrifice important features whether you get one or another like it often happens with cameras you will only get better sound quality as you spend more that’s it this one includes the useful buttons the snowball is missing for mute and volume control it also includes headphones output audiotechnica at2020this microphone was more expensive than the blue yeti when this article was written right now it’s cheaper and has better sound quality yes that’s right its sound quality is much better than the yeti above and it’s cheaper the reason for its price is that this one only offers the cardioid mode but it’s the perfect sensibility pattern for vlogging you won’t need a bidirectional mic unless you need two persons recording at the same time and omnidirectional is usually a bad idea for these videos another reason is that it does not include any mute switch volume control or headphones output unlike the yeti above this is just the trade you get better audio for fewer features that aren’t completely necessary all in all getting something more expensive than an audiotechnica at2020 is only good if you’re an audio professional the sound quality of this condenser microphone is amazingly good for both vlogging and podcasting it is the best you can get at this price range most professionallevel condenser microphones are around the 300 mark and this one is better than some of them you shouldn’t need to get a more expensive mic unless you own a professional audio studio the best recorder for cameras without mic jack zoom h1one of the most annoying things you will find when looking for a new camera is that most of those that are good for vlogging —check my post on the 6 best vlogging cameras with flip screen — don’t come with a mic jack this is especially true with compact and mirrorless cameras but there is a simple way to fix this problem buying an external recorder that you can use to connect a good mic to it the most common choice is the zoom h1 this microphonerecorder is made of two unidirectional mics that are facing each other at 90 degrees this allows you to get good stereo sound it is much better than simply choosing an omnidirectional microphone it is a great choice when you need to take your microphone somewhere it’s comfortable to carry around it also excels at recording music bands thanks to its 2 unidirectional microphones you can position the musicians adequately to use it as a stereo recording system still this recorder will not get rid of the ambient sound even though its sound capturing system is unidirectional its microphones are facing opposite directions this means that it will capture sound from various directions so by itself it’s not the best one to isolate sound that’s why i still think it’s better to get a lavaliere microphone to connect to it rather than using this as a voice recorder alone and if you’re walking around with your camera that’s the only way to record good audio actually for me the perfect combination is getting a giant squid lavalier microphone to connect to the zoom h1 this is a good solution if your camera didn’t come with an external microphone port the giant squid might be the best lavalier microphone for you tube vlogging out there this is the easiest way to vlog while walking with your camera put the h1 in your pocket and connect the giant squid to it zoom h4n pro a more expensive option but also with a lot more advantages is the h4n for starters it’s a lot more resistant although it’s also twice as big it also allows you to rotate the microphone capsules so they’re not fixed at 90 degrees it can also record 4 tracks simultaneously but the biggest change is that it has 2 xlrtrs inputs which are required by most studio microphones and instruments however the microphones i recommend here don’t need this kind of input so it’s only something you’ll need if you want to get more serious about sound most vloggers will find the h1 good enough but if you want to push things to the maximum you’ll want to get the h4n pro the best vlogging microphone to connect to your smartphone power de wise professional grade lavalier this one is in my opinion the best cheap microphone for your smartphone in 2018 i really doubt you can find anything better for that low price it’s really risky to go for any cheap but i’m happy with this one and that’s something i can’t say often if you already have a phone with a good camera it’s okay to start vlogging with it this one is the solution for your sound it will improve it a lot it is one of the few cheap microphones for you tube that i don’t think will disappoint you connecting a microphone to your smartphone is also an alternative to the zoom h1 although this option is not as good it’s a lot cheaper after all there are other similar options that are much more expensive than this one but i don’t think they’re worth the price they’re still omnidirectional and don’t present any significant sound improvement if you’re willing to spend more money you can get a giant squid with an adaptor you will get much better sound quality rode smart lav lavalier microphone another good option is the rode smart lav lavalier microphone this one is more expensive but it does come with better sound quality and sound suppression bear in mind that for ios you will need to pay an extra 599 for the app that allows you to use this microphone best lavalier microphone to connect to your camera if you bought a compact camera you will most likely need to buy a lavalier microphone remember that lavaliers are omnidirectional so they will catch ambient sound however it’s easier to suppress the noise through editing because your voice will be noticeable higher since you clip them on your shirt close to your mouth before starting i just want to tell you that if you have the money for a giant squid just go for it it’s not even worth for you to keep reading this part it is hands down my favorite lavalier microphone its quality is comparable to many professional microphones just be aware that the cable is a bit short if you prefer going for a cheaper mic then the following one will do good for the price the vidpro lavalier condenser microphone is another good cheap microphone for you tube that will improve the sound you can get with your camera the 4 best shotgun microphones for cameras with hot shoe dslr point  shoot or mirrorlesstakstar sgc598hot shoes are found in almost every dslr and some compact cameras the following microphones are attachable to a camera’s hot shoe there’s a good reason why i don’t recommend extremely cheap shotgun microphones the cheap ones don’t deserve the shotgun name they’re bad at suppressing ambient sound they are a lot noisier than they should you’d rather keep using your camera’s builtin mic instead of getting a cheap shotgun mic i know three shotgun microphones that are worth your money now are these mics much different from each other they’re different in terms of quality you just need to know how much money you’re willing to spend and how much noise you need to reduce the prices of the following microphones are relative to the clear audio you achieve so you don’t need to worry about them not meeting your expectations getting a more expensive shotgun microphone will just mean more noise reduction and better recording quality this is why i won’t say much about them i’m just going to show you microphones that are good for their price range gladly there is one good option if you are on a tight budget the rest scale up in cost as they
