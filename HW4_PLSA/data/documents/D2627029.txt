your guidance please  i have tried searching for this info but cannot find anything regarding a suggested ebook length for a work of fiction as we cant use page numbering i need to know the average number of words that is today considered acceptable to the reader if the book is priced at say 299 i have read that customers can feel disappointed if it is too short and converselytoo long can also be a problem the only info i found is to limit it to 50mb not sure how many words hits a 50mb limit many thanks westy advert08132012 0114 pm  2morriss003evangelist posts 438karma 3409790join date feb

4080k novels for both reading and writing nothing makes my heart sink more than a 100k novel because that usually means a time commitment i dont have so its really a subjective different strokes for

published that are under 50000 words thanks morriss003 thats the kind of information i needed to know i was curious to the public reaction to shorter novels  as they are not physically picking up a printed book in a bookstore and can assess the length of it before they part with cash i am given to writing nearer the 100000 mark so that is fine by me just new to the self publishing ebook world and needed the clarification advert08132012 0133 pm  6westy junior member posts 8karma 564808join date aug 2012location ukdevice none quote originally posted by vydor scope75k150k seems to be roughly

price in independant of length i would think that is more the case for well known authors although i do feel quality is more important than hitting 150k just to give value or warrant a 999 ebook price tag as for pricing per word  how about a dollar a word 08132012 0136 pm  7westy junior member posts 8karma 564808join date aug 2012location ukdevice none quote originally posted by anamardoll

generally shorter maybe because of the time commitment you mention  ideal to settle down with a coffee have and it polished off in maybe 2  3 sittings then theres the folks who like to pass a whole week on a single book my target market is young adults  so im thinking it may be the 80k  100k mark unless anyone else knows better08132012 0138 pm  8anamardoll chasing butterflies posts 3132karma

epic fantasy then it may be longer my advice write the story worry about word count after if youve got a clear beginning and ending with a fun ride from one to the other people wont care too much if youre a little short or a little over08132012 0144 pm  9steven lyle jordan grand sorcerer posts 8478karma 5171130join date jan 2006device none quote originally posted by westy as for pricing per word

or warrant a 999 ebook price tag as for pricing per word  how about a dollar a word go over to amazon and look at huge variety of books listed at 299 it seems to be that the price is part of the marketing strategy and not related to length i have seen 250k and 50k word books priced the same if your market is ya romance an alien market to me then what you should do is go look at the top 100 or 200 successful romance books and see what model the followed do they tend to be shorter longer cheap expensive etc that would is what i would do at least i write adult fantasysci fi and i know in my market 100k words is the target length just depends on your market08132012 0441 pm  13mr ploppy feral underclass posts 3622karma 26821535join date jan 2010location yorkshire tha noz device 2nd hand paperback probably depends on genre expectations but mine usually end up somewhere between 2030k which is the traditional average for what i write not that i aim for that amount though i never know how long they will be until theyre finished the only time anyones moaned about length was with a free short story but their complaint was more about it having adverts for my other stuff at the end08132012 0443 pm  14jameswilde guru posts 802karma 4727110join date aug 2010location sweden device iriver story quote originally posted by westy hi guys new here  and happy to become part of this

about as long as a piece of rope quote originally posted by westy as we cant use page numbering i need to know the average number of words that is today considered acceptable to the reader if the book is priced at say 299thats a bit pricey for an ebook so id be expecting a lot of words for my money quote originally posted by westy the only info i found is to limit it to 50mb not sure how many words hits a 50mb limitjust checked a 140000 word file in rtf format is about 25 mb so your 50 mb limit would be 2800000 words youd get even more if you wrote it in odt format probably less in word format seriously if you check the guidelines from say mills  boone theyre looking at ca 50000 words if i remember correctly my first book was 200000 and about 13 too long im working on it now my second is about 140000 and i think about right thats about what i expect for a decent novel a novel nowadays usually has about 350400 words per page irrespective of whether its a paperback or hardcover at least here in sweden so multiply that by the number of pages in a good novel08132012 0447 pm  15jameswilde guru posts 802karma 4727110join date aug 2010location sweden device iriver storymr ploppy i would have thought 2030k was absolutely the short end of the novel spectrum or maybe the long end of the novella spectrum blimey a short story can be 8000 words
