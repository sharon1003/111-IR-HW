many biographies although he died in 1971 it wasnt until the mid1980s that his true birth date of august 4 1901 was discovered through the examination of baptismal records he was recorded as an outofwedlock black child armstrong was born into a very poor family in new orleans louisiana the grandson of slaves he spent his youth in poverty in a rough neighborhood of uptown new orleans known as “back of town” as his father william armstrong 1881–1922 abandoned the family when louis was an infant and took up with another woman his mother mayann armstrong 1886–1942 then left louis and his younger sister beatrice armstrong collins 1903–1987 in the care of his grandmother josephine armstrong and at times his uncle isaac at five he moved back to live with his mother and her relatives and saw his father only in parades he attended the fisk school for boys where he likely had his first exposure to creole music he brought in some money as a paperboy and also by finding discarded food and selling it to restaurants but it wasn’t enough to keep his mother from prostitution he hung out in dance halls particularly the “funky butt” which was the closest to his home where he observed everything from licentious dancing to the quadrille he hauled coal to storyville the famed redlight district and listened to the bands playing in the brothels and dance halls especially pete lala’s where joe king oliver performed and other famous musicians would drop in to jam armstrong grew up at the bottom of the social ladder in a highly segregated city but one which lived in a constant fervor of music which was generally called “ragtime”  not yet “jazz” despite the hard early days armstrong seldom looked back at his youth as the worst of times but instead drew inspiration from it “every time i close my eyes blowing that trumpet of mine—i look right in the heart of good old new orleans it has given me something to live for”after dropping out of the fisk school at eleven armstrong joined a quartet of boys in similar straits as he and they sang in the streets for money he also started to get into trouble cornet player bunk johnson said he taught armstrong then 11 to play by ear at dago tonys tonk in new orleans although in his later years armstrong gave the credit to oliver his first cornet was bought with money loaned to him by the karnofskys a russianjewish immigrant family who had a junk hauling business and gave him odd jobs to express gratitude towards the karnofskys who took him in as almost a family member and fed and nurtured him armstrong wore a star of david pendant for the rest of his life armstrong with his first trumpet instructor peter davis in 1965 armstrong developed his cornet playing seriously in the band of the new orleans home for colored waifs where he had been sent multiple times for general delinquency most notably for a long term after firing his stepfathers pistol into the air at a new years eve celebration as police records confirm professor peter davis who frequently appeared at the home at the request of its administrator captain joseph jones instilled discipline in and provided musical training to the otherwise selftaught armstrong eventually davis made armstrong the band leader the home band played around new orleans and the thirteen year old louis began to draw attention by his cornet playing starting him on a musical career at fourteen he was released from the home living again with his father and new stepmother and then back with his mother and also back to the streets and their temptations armstrong got his first dance hall job at henry ponce’s where black benny became his protector and guide he hauled coal by day and played his cornet at night he also played in the citys frequent brass band parades and listened to older musicians every chance he got learning from bunk johnson buddy petit kid ory and above all joe king oliver who acted as a mentor and father figure to the young musician later he played in the brass bands and riverboats of new orleans and first started traveling with the wellregarded band of fate marable which toured on a steamboat up and down the mississippi river he described his time with marable as going to the university since it gave him a much wider experience working with written arrangements in 1919 joe oliver decided to go north and he resigned his position in kid orys band then regarded as the best hot jazz group in new orleans armstrong replaced his mentor and played second cornet soon he was promoted to first cornet and he also became second trumpet for the tuxedo brass band a society band early career muggles skokiaan mack the knife “heebie jeebies” by louis armstrong and his hot five on march 19 1918 louis married daisy parker from gretna louisiana they adopted a 3yearold boy clarence armstrong whose mother louiss cousin flora died soon after giving birth clarence armstrong was mentally disabled the result of a head injury at an early age and louis would spend the rest of his life taking care of him louiss marriage to parker failed quickly and they separated she died shortly after the divorce through his riverboat experience armstrong’s musicianship began to mature at twenty he could now read music and he started to be featured in extended trumpet solos one of the first jazzmen to do this injecting his own personality and style into his solo turns he had learned how to create a unique sound and also started using singing and patter in his performances in 1922 armstrong joined the exodus to chicago where he had been invited by his mentor joe king oliver to join his creole jazz band and where he could make a sufficient income so that he no longer needed to supplement his music with day labor jobs it was a boom time in chicago and though race relations were poor the “windy city” was teeming with jobs for blacks who were making good wages in factories and had plenty to spend on entertainment olivers band was the best and most influential hot jazz band in chicago in the early 1920s at a time when chicago was the center of the jazz universe armstrong lived like a king in chicago in his own apartment with his own private bath his first excited as he was to be in chicago he began his careerlong pastime of writing nostalgic letters to friends in new orleans as armstrong’s reputation grew he was challenged to “cutting contests” by hornmen trying to displace the new phenom who could blow two hundred high c’s in a row armstrong made his first recordings on the gennett and okeh labels jazz records were starting to boom across the country including taking some solos and breaks while playing second cornet in olivers band in 1923 at this time he met hoagy carmichael with whom he would collaborate later who was introduced by pal bix beiderbecke who now had his own chicago band armstrong enjoyed working with oliver but louis second wife pianist lil hardin armstrong urged him to seek more prominent billing and develop his newer style away from the influence of oliver she had her husband play classical music in church concerts to broaden his skill and improve his solo play and she prodded him into wearing more stylish attire to make him look sharp and to better offset his growing girth lil’s influence eventually undermined armstrong’s relationship with his mentor especially concerning his salary and additional moneys that oliver held back from armstrong and other band members armstrong and oliver parted amicably in 1924 and armstrong received an invitation to go to new york city to play with the fletcher henderson orchestra the top african–american band of the day armstrong switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section his influence upon hendersons tenor sax soloist coleman hawkins can be judged by listening to the records made by the band during this period armstrong quickly adapted to the more tightly controlled style of henderson playing trumpet and even experimenting with the trombone and the other members quickly took up armstrong’s emotional expressive pulse soon his act included singing and telling tales of new orleans characters especially preachers the henderson orchestra was playing in the best venues for whiteonly patrons including the famed roseland ballroom featuring the classy arrangements of don redman duke ellington’s orchestra would go to roseland to catch armstrong’s performances and young hornmen around town tried in vain to outplay him splitting their lips in their attempts during this time armstrong also made many recordings on the side arranged by an old friend from new orleans pianist clarence williams these included small jazz band sides with the williams blue five some of the best pairing armstrong with one of armstrongs few rivals in fiery technique and ideas sidney bechet and a series of accompaniments with blues singers including bessie smith ma rainey and alberta hunter armstrong returned to chicago in 1925 due mostly to the urging of his wife who wanted to pump up armstrong’s career and income he was content in new york but later would concede that she was right and that the henderson orchestra was limiting his artistic growth in publicity much to his chagrin she billed him as “the world’s greatest trumpet player” at first he was actually a member of the lil hardin armstrong band and working for his wife he began recording under his own name for okeh with his famous hot five and hot seven groups producing hits such as potato head blues muggles a reference to marijuana for which armstrong had a lifelong fondness and west end blues the music of which set the standard and the agenda for jazz for many years to come the group included kid ory trombone johnny dodds clarinet johnny st cyr banjo wife lil on piano and usually no drummer armstrong’s bandleading style was easygoing as st cyr noted one felt so relaxed working with him and he was very broadminded  always did his best to feature each individual his recordings soon after with pianist earl fatha hines most famously their 1928 weatherbird duet and armstrongs trumpet introduction to west end blues remain some of the most famous and influential improvisations in jazz history armstrong was now free to develop his personal style as he wished which included a heavy dose of effervescent jive such as whip that thing miss lil and mr johnny dodds aw do that clarinet boy armstrong also played with erskine tate’s little symphony actually a quintet which played mostly at the vendome theatre they furnished music for silent movies and live shows including jazz versions of classical music such as “madame butterfly” which gave armstrong experience with longer forms of music and with hosting before a large audience he began to scat sing improvised vocal jazz using nonsensical words and was among the first to record it on heebie jeebies in 1926 so popular was the recording the group became the most famous jazz band in america even though they as yet had not performed live to any great degree young musicians across the country black and white were turned on by armstrong’s new type of jazz after separating from lil armstrong started to play at the sunset café for al capones associate joe glaser in the carroll dickerson orchestra with earl hines on piano which was soon renamed louis armstrong and his stompers though hines was the music director and glaser managed the orchestra hines and armstrong became fast friends as well as successful collaborators armstrong returned to new york in 1929 where he played in the pit orchestra of the successful musical hot chocolate an allblack revue written by andy razaf and pianistcomposer fats waller he also made a cameo appearance as a vocalist regularly stealing the show with his rendition of aint misbehavin his version of the song becoming his biggest selling record to date armstrong started to work at connies inn in harlem the second nightspot in fame to the cotton club and a front for gangster dutch schultz armstrong also had considerable success with vocal recordings including versions of famous songs composed by his old friend hoagy carmichael his 1930s recordings took full advantage of the new rca ribbon microphone introduced in 1931 which imparted a characteristic warmth to vocals and immediately became an intrinsic part of the crooning sound of artists like bing crosby armstrongs famous interpretation of hoagy carmichaels stardust became one of the most successful versions of this song ever recorded showcasing armstrongs unique vocal sound and style and his innovative approach to singing songs that had already become standards armstrongs radical reworking of sidney arodin and carmichaels lazy river recorded in 1931 encapsulated many features of his groundbreaking approach to melody and phrasing the song begins with a brief trumpet solo then the main melody is stated by sobbing horns which are memorably punctuated by armstrongs growling interjections at the end of each bar yeah uhhuh sure  way down way down in the first verse he ignores the notated melody entirely and sings as if playing a trumpet solo pitching most of the first line on a single note and using strongly syncopated phrasing in the second stanza he breaks into an almost fully improvised melody which then evolves into a classic passage of armstrong scat singing as with his trumpet playing armstrongs vocal innovations served as a foundation stone for the art of jazz vocal interpretation the uniquely gritty coloration of his voice became a musical archetype that was much imitated and endlessly impersonated his scat singing style was enriched by his matchless experience as a trumpet soloist his resonant velvety lowerregister tone and bubbling cadences on sides such as lazy river exerted a huge influence on younger white singers such as bing crosby the depression of the early thirties was especially hard on the jazz scene the cotton club closed in 1936 after a long downward spiral and many musicians stopped playing altogether as club dates evaporated bix beiderbecke died and fletcher henderson’s band broke up king olivier made a few records but otherwise struggled sidney bechet became a tailor and kid ory returned to new orleans and raised chickens armstrong moved to los angeles in 1930 seeking new opportunities he played at the new cotton club in la with lionel hampton on drums and the band drew the hollywood crowd which could still afford a lavish night life and radio broadcasts from the club connected with younger audiences at home bing crosby and many other celebrities were regulars at the club in 1931 armstrong appeared in his first movie exflame armstrong was convicted of marijuana possession but received a suspended sentence he returned to chicago in late 1931 and played in bands more in the guy lombardo vein and he recorded more standards when the mob insisted that he get out of town armstrong visited new orleans got a hero’s welcome and saw old friends he sponsored a local baseball team known as “armstrong’s secret nine” and got a cigar named after himself but soon he was on the road again and after a tour across the country shadowed by the mob armstrong decided to go to europe to escape after returning to the states he undertook several exhausting tours his agent johnny collins’ erratic behavior and his own spending ways left armstrong short of cash breach of contract violations plagued him finally he hired joe glaser as his new manager a tough mobconnected wheelerdealer who began to straighten out his legal mess his mob troubles and his debts armstrong also began to experience problems with his fingers and lips which were aggravated by his unorthodox playing style as a result he branched out developing his vocal style and making his first theatrical appearances he appeared in movies again in 1937 armstrong substituted for rudy vallee on the cbs radio network and became the first black to host a sponsored national broadcast he finally divorced lil in 1938 and married longtime girlfriend alpha after spending many years on the road armstrong settled permanently in queens new york in 1943 in contentment with his fourth wife lucille although subject to the vicissitudes of tin pan alley and the gangsterridden music business as well as antiblack prejudice he continued to develop his playing he recorded hoagy carmichaels rockin chair for okeh records during the subsequent thirty years armstrong played more than three hundred gigs a year bookings for big bands tapered off during the 1940s due to changes in public tastes ballrooms closed and there was competition from television and from other types of music becoming more popular than big band music it became impossible under such circumstances to support and finance a 16piece touring band the all stars following a highly successful smallgroup jazz concert at new york town hall on may 17 1947 featuring armstrong with trombonistsinger jack teagarden armstrongs manager joe glaser dissolved the armstrong big band on august 13 1947 and established a sixpiece small group featuring armstrong with initially teagarden earl hines and other top swing and dixieland musicians most of them exbig band leaders the new group was announced at the opening of billy bergs supper club this group was called all stars and included at various times earl fatha hines barney bigard edmond hall jack teagarden trummy young arvell shaw billy kyle marty napoleon big sid catlett cozy cole tyree glenn barrett deems and the filipinoamerican percussionist danny barcelona during this period armstrong made many recordings and appeared in over thirty films he appeared on the cover of time magazine on february 21 1949 in 1964 he recorded his biggestselling record hello dolly the song went to 1 on the pop chart making armstrong age 63 the oldest person to ever accomplish that feat in the process armstrong dislodged the beatles from the 1 position they had occupied for 14 consecutive weeks with three different songs armstrong kept up his busy tour schedule until a few years before his death in 1971 in his later years he would sometimes play some of his numerous gigs by rote but other times would enliven the most mundane gig with his vigorous playing often to the astonishment of his band he also toured africa europe and asia under sponsorship of the us state department with great success earning the nickname ambassador satch while failing health restricted his schedule in his last years within those limitations he continued playing until the day he died autograph of armstrong on the muretto of alassio personality the nickname satchmo or satch is short for satchelmouth describing his embouchure in 1932 then melody maker magazine editor percy brooks greeted armstrong in london with hello satchmo  and it stuck early on he was also known as dippermouth this is a reference to the propensity he had for refreshing himself with the dipper or ladle from a bucket of sugar water which was always present on stage with joe olivers band in chicago in the early nineteentwenties the damage to his embouchure from his high pressure approach to playing is acutely visible in many pictures of louis from the midtwenties it also led to his emphasizing his singing career because at certain periods he was unable to play however after having set his trumpet aside for a while he amended his playing style and continued his trumpet career friends and fellow musicians usually called him pops which is also how armstrong usually addressed his friends and fellow musicians except for pops foster whom armstrong always called george satchmos autograph from the 1960s he was also criticized for accepting the title of king of the zulus  in the new orleans africanamerican community an honored role as head of leading black carnival krewe but bewildering or offensive to outsiders with their traditional costume of grassskirts and blackface makeup satirizing southern white attitudes  for mardi gras 1949 whatever the case where some saw a gregarious and outgoing personality others saw someone trying too hard to appeal to white audiences and essentially becoming a minstrel caricature some musicians criticized armstrong for playing in front of segregated audiences and for not taking a strong enough stand in the civil rights movement suggesting that he was an uncle tom billie holiday countered however of course pops toms but he toms from the heart armstrong in fact was a major financial supporter of dr martin luther king jr and other civil rights activists but mostly preferred to work quietly behind the scenes not mixing his politics with his work as an entertainer the few exceptions made it more effective when he did speak out armstrongs criticism of president eisenhower calling him twofaced and gutless because of his inaction during the conflict over school desegregation in little rock arkansas in 1957 made national news as a protest armstrong canceled a planned tour of the soviet union on behalf of the state department saying the way theyre treating my people in the south the government can go to hell and that he could not represent his government abroad when it was in conflict with its own people the fbi kept a file on armstrong for his outspokenness about integration he was an extremely generous man who was said to have given away as much money as he kept for himself armstrong was also greatly concerned with his health and bodily functions he made frequent use of laxatives as a means of controlling his weight a practice he advocated both to personal acquaintances and in the diet plans he published under the title lose weight the satchmo way armstrongs laxative of preference in his younger days was pluto water but he then became an enthusiastic convert when he discovered the herbal remedy swiss kriss he would extol its virtues to anyone who would listen and pass out packets to everyone he encountered including members of the british royal family armstrong also appeared in humorous albeit risqué advertisements for swiss kriss the ads bore a picture of him sitting on a toilet — as viewed through a keyhole — with the slogan satch says leave it all behind ya the concern with his health and weight was balanced by his love of food reflected in such songs as cheesecake cornet chop suey though struttin’ with some barbecue was written about a finelooking companion not about food he kept a strong connection throughout his life to the cooking of new orleans always signing his letters red beans and ricely yours although armstrong is not known to have fathered any children he loved children and would go out of his way to entertain the neighborhood kids in corona and to encourage young musicians armstrong’s gregariousness extended to writing on the road he wrote constantly many of the favorite themes of his life he shared with correspondents around the world he avidly typed or wrote on whatever stationery was at hand instant takes on music sex food childhood memories his heavy “medicinal” marijuana use and even his bowel movements which were gleefully described he had a fondness for lewd jokes and dirty limericks as well armstrong was an avid audiophile he had a large collection of recordings including reeltoreel tapes which he took on the road with him in a trunk during his later career he enjoyed listening to his own recordings and comparing his performances musically in the den of his home he had the latest audio equipment and would sometimes rehearse and record along with his older recordings or the radio death armstrong died of a heart attack on july 6 1971 at age 69 11 months after playing a famous show at the waldorfastorias empire room shortly before his death he stated i think i had a beautiful life i didnt wish for anything that i couldnt get and i got pretty near everything i wanted because i worked for it he was residing in corona queens new york city at the time of his death he was interred in flushing cemetery flushing in queens new york city his honorary pallbearers included governor rockefeller mayor lindsay bing crosby ella fitzgerald guy lombardo duke ellington dizzy gillespie pearl bailey count basie harry james frank sinatra ed sullivan earl wilson alan king johnny carson david frost merv griffin dick cavett and bobby hackett peggy lee one of armstrongs favorite vocalists sang the lords prayer at the services music armstrong gained fame as a horn player then later became better known as a bandleader vocalist musical ambassador and founding figure in much modern american music horn playing and early jazz in his early years armstrong was best known for his virtuosity with the cornet and trumpet the greatest trumpet playing of his early years can be heard on his hot five and hot seven records the improvisations which he made on these records of new orleans jazz standards and popular songs of the day continue to stack up brilliantly alongside those of any other later jazz performer the older generation of new orleans jazz musicians often referred to their improvisations as variating the melody armstrongs improvisations were daring and sophisticated for the time while often subtle and melodic he often essentially recomposed poptunes he played making them more interesting armstrongs playing is filled with joyous inspired original melodies creative leaps and subtle relaxed or driving rhythms the genius of these creative passages is matched by armstrongs playing technique honed by constant practice which extended the range tone and capabilities of the trumpet in these records armstrong almost singlehandedly created the role of the jazz soloist taking what was essentially a collective folk music and turning it into an art form with tremendous possibilities for individual expression armstrongs work in the 1920s shows him playing at the outer limits of his abilities the hot five records especially often have minor flubs and missed notes which do little to detract from listening enjoyment since the energy of the spontaneous performance comes through by the mid 1930s armstrong achieved a smooth assurance knowing exactly what he could do and carrying out his ideas to perfection vocal popularity as his music progressed and popularity grew his singing also became important armstrong was not the first to record scat singing but he was masterful at it and helped popularize it he had a hit with his playing and scat singing on heebie jeebies when according to some legends the sheet music fell on the floor and he simply started singing nonsense syllables armstrong stated in his memoirs that this actually occurred he also sang out i done forgot the words in the middle of recording im a ding dong daddy from dumas such records were hits and scat singing became a major part of his performances long before this however armstrong was playing around with his vocals shortening and lengthening phrases interjecting improvisations using his voice as creatively as his trumpet colleagues and followers during his long career he played and sang with the most important instrumentalists and vocalists among the many singing brakeman jimmie rodgers bing crosby duke ellington fletcher henderson bessie smith and notably with ella fitzgerald his influence upon bing crosby is particularly important with regard to the subsequent development of popular music crosby admired and copied armstrong as is evident on many of his early recordings notably just one more chance 1931 the new grove dictionary of jazz describes crosbys debt to armstrong in precise detail although it does not acknowledge armstrong by name crosbywas important in introducing into the mainstream of popular singing an afroamerican concept of song as a lyrical extension of speech his techniques  easing the weight of the breath on the vocal cords passing into a head voice at a low register using forward production to aid distinct enunciation singing on consonants a practice of black singers and making discreet use of appoggiaturas mordents and slurs to emphasize the text  were emulated by nearly all later popular singers armstrong recorded three albums with ella fitzgerald ella and louis ella and louis again and porgy and bess for verve records with the sessions featuring the backing musicianship of the oscar peterson trio and drummer buddy rich his recordings satch plays fats all fats waller tunes and louis armstrong plays w c handy in the 1950s were perhaps among the last of his great creative recordings but even oddities like disney songs the satchmo way are seen to have their musical moments and his participation in dave brubecks highconcept jazz musical the real ambassadors was critically acclaimed for the most part however his later output was criticized as being overly simplistic or repetitive hits and later career armstrong had many hit records including stardust what a wonderful world when the saints go marching in dream a little dream of me aint misbehavin and stompin at the savoy we have all the time in the world featured on the soundtrack of the james bond film on her majestys secret service and enjoyed renewed popularity in the uk in 1994 when it featured on a guinness advert it reached number 3 in the charts on being rereleased in 1964 armstrong knocked the beatles off the top of the billboard top 100 chart with hello dolly which gave the 63yearold performer a u s record as the oldest artist to have a 1 song his 1964 song bout time later featured in the film bewitched 2005 armstrong performed in italy at the 1968 sanremo music festival where he sang mi va di cantare 36 alongside his friend the eritreanborn italian singer lara saint paul in february of 1968 he also appeared with lara saint paul on the italian rai television channel where he performed grassa e bella a track he sang in italian for the italian market and c d i label in 1968 armstrong scored one last popular hit in the united kingdom with the highly sentimental pop song what a wonderful world which topped the british charts for a month however the single did not chart at all in america the song gained greater currency in the popular consciousness when it was used in the 1987 movie good morning vietnam its subsequent rerelease topping many charts around the world armstrong even appeared on the october 28 1970 johnny cash show where he sang nat king coles hit rambling rose and joined cash to recreate his performance backing jimmie rodgers on blue yodel  9 stylistic range armstrong

his performances sometimes to the bewilderment of fans who wanted armstrong to stay in convenient narrow categories armstrong was inducted into rock and roll hall of fame as an early influence some of his solos from the 1950s such as the hard rocking version of st louis blues from the wc handy album show that the influence went in both directions literature radio films and tv armstrong appeared in

used in the 1993 film sleepless in seattle his 1923 recordings with joe oliver and his creole jazz band continue to be listened to as documents of ensemble style new orleans jazz but more particularly as ripper jazz records in their own right all too often however armstrong recorded with stiff standard orchestras leaving only his sublime trumpet playing as of interest melancholy blues performed by

cortázar a selfdescribed armstrong admirer asserted that a 1952 louis armstrong concert at the théâtre des champsélysées in paris played a significant role in inspiring him to create the fictional
