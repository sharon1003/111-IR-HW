population density may produce intense behavioral and neuroendocrine disturbances through the increase of social contacts holst 1972 lloyd 1975a b brain 1975 a 0 the large diversity of hormonal responses under various stress states caused some authors mason 1974 pollard et al 1975 a 0 to assume that the global endoerine reaction of the organism is not restricted to the activation of the hypothalamohypophysealadrenal system therefore according to  mason 1974 the hormonal responses are interdependent through their metabolic effects which in turn ean lead to nonadaptative physiologieal changes typical for stress reaction the physiological reaction of endocrine pancreas under stress conditions was insufficiently studied and with contradictory results curry and curry 1970 bloom et al  972 1973 vigas et al 1973 freeman and manning 1976 however recent morphological investigations mincu et al 1978 revealed marked alterations induced by crowding stress at the level of this gland in many respects similar to those dtscribed in mild diabetic syndrome or during remission from diabetes like and  miin 1967 like and chick 1974 like et al 1974 a 0 thus they seem to support the diabetogenic role of various stress states previously postulated by porte and robertson 1973 and particularly the statistical data on the higher incidence of glycoregulation disfunetions in town areas pa itly ascribed to crowding psychosocial stress mincu 1977 kruger 1978 the purpose of the present study is to reveal the occurrence and development of morphological changes in mice pancreatic islets correlated with glycemia dynamics under shortterm exposure to crowding stress the implications of such investigations on rodents may be useful for the human situation as well jv1 aterial and methods sventy six adult male specimens of albino b2 mice biobrm labs were used the experiments started 6 weeks after weaning the ltnimals were housed in pairs male female in round shaped glass containers 25 em dilmeter with a stlmdard diet provided ad libitum four experimental groups were mndomyltssigned by placing 15 ma es in containers of the same dimension other 16 mtles were further housed in pairs

sacrificed by decapitation blood samples ltnd the pltncrelts from each individual were immedittely removed throughout the experiments the animals were given food md water ltd libitum tnd the environmenttl tempemture was 22 ± 2°c the pltsma glucose concentrations were determined by using the colorimetric test with otoluidine according to ghetie and tripocvici 1964 the light microscopic investigttions were performed on bouinfixed and partffinembedded pancreas pieces the following staining techniques were employed hemalumeosin aldehyde fuchsin  trichrome mallorys phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin ptah silver impregmltion hellman and hellerstrom 19 0 toluidine blue titer methybtion and demethylation manoccil io 19 4 and pseudoisocyanine coalson 19 6 the sections stained by the last

glutlualdehyde serva heidelberg in 01 m phosphate buffer p h  74 and then wllshed overnight at 4 °c in 34 changes of the same buffer subsequently the fragments were postfixed for 1hour in cold

watson 1958 and lead citrate reynolds 19 3 were examined under jem7 80 kv and philips201 60 kv electron microscopes results behavioral observations the mice exposed to crowding showed an unusual state of tumoroil due to their enhanced irritability and aggressiveness violent fights were recorded particularly in the first 46 hours of the experiments as a rule the fights lasted 1015 minutes followed by periods of 1015 minutes rest one or two individuals died in the first 23 hours and other 23 individuals which at this time showed symptoms of physiological exhaustion did not survive over 24 hours most alive specimens displayed serious bites in order to tomaintain the constant crowding density along the experiments the dead individuals were replaced with others grown in similar conditions they were previously marked to be distinguished from those placed into experiment before morphological observations there is an extensive literature concerning the cellular organization and fine structure of the pancreatic islets in normal mice bjorkman et al 1963 hellerstrom et al 1964 logo thetopoulos and bell 1966 logothetopoulos 1967 andersson et al 1970 ao since our morphological findings in control animals are similar to those previously reported they will not be commented upon in the present st udy marked histological and ultrastructural alterations were recorded in the pancreatic islets of all crowded specimens beginning with 4 hours interval the changes affected prticularly the insulin producing cells bcells and their severity seemed to depend both on the length of experiment and on the individual reactivity moreover in a single specimen great differences in the morphological response were observed from one islet to another and even among the same type of cells belonging to an islet therefore in order to facilitate the presentation of the results we shall attempt to describe only the significant changes for each experimental interval light microscopythe earliest alterations were noticed after 4 hours of stress exposure and consisted in the mild degranulation and slight foaminess of the cytoplasm in a small number of bcells at t1ts time interval both somatostatin a1and glucagon a2producing cells appeared unaffected by experimental conditions bcell degranulation was widespread and relatively pronounced among the 24 hours crowded specimens fig 1a as a rule it was associated ·with cytoplasm vacuolization and the margination of the remaining secretory material several bcells displayed pycnotic nuclei while others in an advanced degranulation stage were of increased size and contained moderate enlarged nuclei figs 1 b c at 24 hours no changes were discernible in the a1and a2cells morphology fig 1 d  at 48 hours the degranulation and vacuolization of bcells also represented the most prevalent histological alterations figs 1 eh although the degranulation process did not seem to be more pronounced than in the previous experimental interval it affected almost all cells of this type fig 1 e the incidence of pycnotic bcell nuclei encountered per islet was higher than at 24 hours but hypertrophied cells and nuclei were not observed fig if for the first time at 48 hours a relative large number of a1and a2cells displayed various degrees of cytoplasm degranulation and vacuolizationj figs ig h in several cases among the other acell alterations pycnosis of the nuclei was noticed fig 1 h the reduction of the secretory material amount and the development of large cytoplasmic vacuoles diminished considerably the specific staining affinities of the different islet cell types and therefore their indentification was sometimes difficult ei ectr 0 n mi cro s cop y two hours after beginning of the crowding experiments single conspicu dus changes were observed at the level of golgi complexes these organelles occurred much more extended than in control sections and showed greatly enlarged cisternae and vesicles fig2 within them evidence of secretory granules undergoing maturation could often be seen these changes were more pronounced and usually encountered in the bcells they suggested a higher rate of insulin synthesis although at this time interval the secretory granules amounts remained visibly unaltered and no morphological evidence of enhanced hormone discharge was found at 4 hours crowding a limited number of bcells appeared partly degranulated in their cytoplasm small clear spaces previously occupied by secretory granules or vesicles representing empty granule sacs occurred randomly spread or sometimes accumulated under the plasma membranes figs 3 4 the empty vesicles were frequently larger than the neighbouring cored ones and showed fusion tendency the coalescence of the secretory granules surrounding membranes but not of their content was also observed in many bcells the golgi complexes hypertrophy was still more visible in addition at this interval several mitochondria belonging to the different islet cell types were swollen and exhibited focal cavitations figs 35 fig 1 ah pancreatic islets of specimens exposed for 24 h ad and 48 h eh to crowding stress tt

a large number of bcells showed drastic decrease in num ber of secretory granules and marked alterations in the structure of their organelles figs 68 the high frequency of the empty secretory granules as well as the porous core of others indicated the intracytoplasmic dissolution of their content as the basic mechanism of degranulation figs 6 8 on the other hand the margination of the secretory granules oberved also at 24 hours suggested the role of emiocytosis in the degranulation process the golgi complexes occurred greatly expanded and dilated or sometimes involuted figs 6 7 the mitochondria were swollen and displayed clear vacuoles in which partly destroyed cristae or their remainders could be seen fig 7 on the contrary other mitochondria appeared with electrondense matrices and less conspicuous cristae fig 8 as result of cristae destruetion they occurred sometimes as vesicles filled with an amorphous material and could hardly be recognized one of the most striking alterations at 24 hours consisted in the ergastoplasm dilatation with formation of clar vacuoles particularly in the perinuclear zone of the bcells figs 6 8 other clear vacuoles but of smaller size also occurred by the coalescence of the empty sacs of secretory granules due to the different stages of degranulation and vacuolization as well as to the different density of cytoplasm some bcells appeared light and others dark fig 6 the light cells were more numerous ratio 17 1 and sometimes showed moderate hypertrophied nuclei on the contrary in the dark cells shrunken nuclei were sporadically encountered fig 7 the appearance of light and dark cells seemed to reflect remarkable differences in their functional condition thus while the ultrastructural features of the first category suggested a secretory hyperactivity the aspect of the latter supported rather the diminishing of their synthesizing capacity except the moderate enlargement of the golgi complexes and sometimes the mitochondria swelling and vacuolization no other changes were detected at 24 hours in both types of acells the pancreatic islets of 48 hours crowded mice showed fine structural alterations similar in many respects to those found in the bcells at the previous time interval the alterations expanded over all cell types and intensity and mainly the incidence of some mitochondria swelling or shrinkage golgi complexes hypertrophy or involution ergastoplasm enlargement nuclei pycnosis were considerably higher figs 911 the ultrastructural differences between light and dark bcells were clearer whereas their numerical ratio was changed in favour of light ones at 48 hours too finally it is of interest to mention that no evidence for acinoislet cells transformation was found both in control and experimental groups blood glucose levels except the 24 hours interval plasma glucose values of the other experimental groups were aeeording to ttest significantly p  001 lower than the control ones fig 12 thus after the sharp depression recorded at 2 hours of stress exposure the plasma glucose level was at 4 hours more than twofold inereased but remained significantly p  001 lower in comparison to eontrol values subsequently the nonsignificant p  o od slight hyperglycemia obtained at 24 hours was followed at 48 hours by a return approximately to the hypoglycemic level at 4

condition an important role in the regulation of social behavior was also recently assigned to gonadotropins which at least in birds seem to mimic the effects of testosterone in mammals crook and butterfield 1968 lloyd 1975 b our investigations revealed important changes in the structure of pancreatic islets along the 48 hours of experiment if only bcells appeared affected in an early stage 2 hours beginning with 4 hours interval the alterations progressively affected the other cell types too besides most frequent changes suggested the stimulation of the entire gland secretory activity

exposure to various stressors on the other hand changes such as golgi complex involution the reduction of free or attached ribosomes mitochondria shrinkage and high electronopacity of their matrices cytoplasmic vacuoles nuclei pycnosis noticed in a number of dark bcells at 24 and 48 hours of crowding exposure might be interpreted as symptoms of a moderate inhibition of secretory activity presumably reversible after the cessation of the stress state they may be due to functional exhaustion of cells or rather decreased insulin release in reponse to stressor even more pronounced involutive changes have been previously reported in different rodent organs pancreatic islets adenohypophysis adrenals kidneys exposed to crowding or to other stress agents usually for longer time intervals than in present experiments mc kinney and pasley 1973 pollard and cairncross 1977 mincu et al 1978 petrescuraianu et al 1978 while some of them appeared irreversible being similar to those described in phase iiicastration cells of human pituitary kovacs and horvath 1975 the other ones less marked were regarded as adaptative changes as ultrastructural investigations demonstrated in rat adenohypophysis pollard et al 1976 and hamster pancreatic islets mincu et al 1978 the less pronounced involutive changes may coexist with those supporting secretory hyperaetivity of the cells or like the latter they may gradually disappear the morphological data supporting the increase of insulin secretion were reflected in the lowerings of plasma glucose eoncentrations at three of the four studied intervals thus the drastic drop of glycemia obtained at 2 hours might be eorrelated with mobilization of both insulin storage and synthesis related pools while the hypoglycemia recorded at 4 and 48 hours might be entirely due to stimulation of the synthesizing capaeity of bcells in this context the slight nonsignificant hyperglycemia at 24 hours appears difficult to explain at first sight however morphological evidence of increased glucagonand diminished insulin involutive changes in the dark bcells secretion found at this time interval might be responsible at least partly for this phenomenon the present observations on the secretory activity of bcells and glycemia are difficult to reconcile with contradictory data on plasma insulin levels under various acute stress states bauer et al 1969 cury and curry 1970 vigas et al 1973 a 0 in this sense the concept of the dual function of catecholamines related to the two pools model of insulin secretion proposed by porte and robertson 1973 represents a convenient way to bring them into agreement the changes recorded in both a1and a2cell types similar in many respects to those found in the hyperactive bcells were however less marked and affected a restrieted number of cells as in our previous investigations on hamster pancreas mincu et al 1978 they indicated the moderate stimulation of glucagon and somatostatin secretion and at least concerning the first hormone correspond to physiological results obtained under other acute stress states bloom et al 1972 1973 freeman and manning 1976 taking into account that so matostatin proved to be a potent inhibitor of insulin and glucagon synthesis and release weir et al 1974 assan 1976 a 0  it seems reasonable to assume that the activation of its secretion in the pancreas during the present experiment might represent a secondary effect of enhanced secretion of the other two hormones the mechanism by which the stress agents influence the secretion of pancreatic hormones is still controversial an important role was ascribed to cortex andor medulla adrenal hormones based on their multiple involvements both in glueidic metabolism and stress reaction in this sense the increased plasma levels of corticoids and catecholamines in various stress states crowding included louch and higginbotham 1967 holst 1972 hucklebridge et al 1973 a 0  as well as their effects sometimes contradictory on pancreatic hormone secretion rastogi and campbell 1970 feldman et al 1971 marco et al 1973 george and rayfield 1974 a 0 indicate their role in the mediation of stressinduced pancreatin and glycemic alterations another way of catecholamine action on insulin and glycagon secretion is supported by their discharge as sympathetic neurotransmitters blooll i et al 1972 1973 porte and robertson 1973 a 0 according to porte and robertson 1973 pathological stress conditions may induce a metabolic state similar to diabetes with hyperglycemia and poor insulin response to glucose challenge in addition some evidence supporting the diabetogenic role of psychosocial stress has been recently reported mincu 1977 kruger 1978 our observations agree with clinical and epidemiological data demonstrating high levels of serllm insulin frequently assoeiated with hypoglacemia in the early phase of obesity induetion ionescutirgovlfil te et al 1976 this disfunetion
