spirituality spirituality for indigenous australians takes many forms pukumani poles from the tiwi islands photographer carl bento Â© australian museum want free general admission all year round its forms and practices have been profoundly influenced by the impact of colonialism both past and present some indigenous australians share the religious beliefs and values of religions introduced into australia from other cultures around the world particularly europe but for most people religious beliefs are derived from a sense of belongingto the land to the sea to other people to ones culture the form and expression of spirituality differs between aboriginal people and torres strait islanders aboriginal spirituality mainly derives from the stories of the dreaming while torres strait islander spirituality draws upon the stories of the tagai the missionsso the sad thing about it all was the missionaries didnt realise that we already had something that tied in with what theyd brought to us they saw different as inferior and they didnt ask us what it was that we had and its very sad because if they had asked things may have been different today our people before the white man came were very spiritual people they were connected to land and creation through the great spirit there was a good great and a great evil spirit and satan was the great evil one so there wasnt much difference in what the missionaries brought and what we already hadwadjularbinna doomadgee gungalidda leader gulf of carpentaria 1996since the european colonisation of australia indigenous australians have had contact with missionaries and their missions this relationship has been a difficult one in some instances missions became instruments of government policy engaging in practices such as forcibly separating aboriginal children from their families in order to maximise control over the childs education into christian ways and beliefs in this way missions contributed to the suppression of aboriginal cultural practices and languages however not all missions were agents of government policies some respected aboriginal ways of life and the importance of ceremonies and cultural practices the dreaming what is the dreaming the dreaming means our identity as people the cultural teaching and everything thats part of our lives here you know its the understanding of what we have around us merv penrith elder wallaga lake 1996the dreaming has different meanings for different aboriginal people it is a complex network of knowledge faith and practices that derive from stories of creation and it dominates all spiritual and physical aspects of aboriginal life the dreaming sets out the structures of society the rules for social behaviour and the ceremonies performed in order to maintain the life of the land it governed the way people lived and how they should behave those who did not follow the rules were punished the dreaming or dreamtime is often used to describe the time when the earth and humans and animals were created the dreaming is also used by individuals to refer to their own dreaming or their communitys dreaming during the dreaming ancestral spirits came to earth and created the landforms the animals and plants the stories tell how the ancestral spirits moved through the land creating rivers lakes and mountains today we know the places where the ancestral spirits have been and where they came to rest there are explanations of how people came to australia and the links between the groups throughout australia there are explanations about how people learnt languages and dance and how they came to know about fire in essence the dreaming comes from the land in aboriginal society people did not own the land it was part of them and it was part of their duty to respect and look after mother earth the dreaming did not end with the arrival of europeans but simply entered a new phase it is a powerful living force that must be maintained and cared for dreaming stories what are dreaming stories about dreaming stories vary throughout australia and there are different versions on the same theme for example the story of how the birds got their colours is different in new south wales and in western australia stories cover many themes and topics there are stories about creation of sacred places landforms people animals and plants there are also stories of language or the first use of fire in more recent times there are stories telling of the arrival of the first europeans on ships or stories about trading with macassan fisherman in northern australia the tracks of life the journey of the spirit ancestors across the land are recorded in dreaming tracks a dreaming track joins a number of sites which trace the path of an ancestral being as it moved through the landscape forming its features creating its flora and fauna and laying down the laws one of these spirit ancestors is the rainbow serpent whose dreaming track is shared by many aboriginal communities across australia rainbow serpentand that is the resting place of the rainbow serpent and all of the gullies and all of the lagoon itself was about the rainbow serpent created after he had created the universe and all the dry gullies is the tracks that hes made looking for a resting place carl mc grady aboriginal education assistant boggabilla describing the path of the rainbow serpent at boobera lagoon northern new south wales 1996 the rainbow serpent is represented as a large snakelike creature whose dreaming track is always associated with watercourses such as billabongs rivers creeks and lagoons it is the protector of the land its people and the source of all life however the rainbow serpent can also be a destructive force if it is not properly respected the rainbow serpent is a consistent theme in aboriginal painting and has been found in rock art up to 6000 years old the rainbow serpent is a powerful symbol of the creative and destructive power of nature most paintings of rainbow serpents tell the story of the creation of the landscape particular to an artists birthplace some aspects of rainbow serpent stories are restricted to initiated persons but generally the image had been very public today most artists add personal clan designs to the bodies of rainbow serpents symbolising links between the artist and the land the mimi spirits the mimi are tall thin beings that live in the rocky escarpment of northern australia as spirits before the coming of aboriginal people they had human forms the mimi are generally harmless but on occasions can be mischievous when aboriginal people first came to northern australia the mimi taught them how to hunt and cook kangaroos and other animals they also did the first rock paintings and taught aboriginal people how to paint the tagaiim as much a torres strait islander irrespective of where i live because my feelings of being a torres strait islander live inside me it is not predicated by what is outside me it is determined with my feelings and my spirituality bilyana blomely academic coordinator lismore 1996the people throughout the torres strait are united by their connection to the tagai the tagai consists of stories which are the cornerstone of torres strait islanders spiritual beliefs these stories focus on the stars and identify torres strait islanders as sea people who share a common way of life the instructions of the tagai provide order in the world ensuring that everything has a place one tagai story depicts the tagai as a man standing in a canoe in his left hand he holds a fishing spear representing the southern cross in his right hand he holds a sorbi a red fruit in this story the tagai and his crew of 12 are preparing for a journey but before the journey begins the crew consume all the food and drink they planned to take so the tagai strung the crew together in two groups of six and cast them into the sea where their images became star patterns in the sky these patterns can be seen in the star constellations of pleiades and orion last updated 30 october 2015related sections indigenous australians overview related items cultural
