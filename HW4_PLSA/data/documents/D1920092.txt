normal function from ncbi gene this gene encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr family of receptor tyrosine kinases this membranebound protein has a neuregulin binding domain but not an active kinase domain it therefore can bind this ligand but not convey the signal into the cell through protein phosphorylation however it does form heterodimers with other egf receptor family members which do have kinase activity heterodimerization leads to the activation of pathways which lead to cell proliferation or differentiation amplification of this gene andor overexpression of its protein have been reported in numerous cancers including prostate bladder and breast tumors alternate transcriptional splice variants encoding different isoforms have been characterized one isoform lacks the intermembrane region and is secreted outside the cell this form acts to modulate the activity of the membranebound form additional splice variants have also been reported but they have not been thoroughly characterized provided by ref seq jul 2008from uni prot tyrosineprotein kinase that plays an essential role as cell surface receptor for neuregulins binds to neuregulin1 nrg1 and is activated by it ligandbinding increases phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and promotes its association with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3kinase pub med20682778 may also be activated by cspg5 pub med15358134 related information what is dna what is a gene how do genes direct the production of proteins more about how genes work
