nicky ng researcher answered may 16 2012yes in fact the cockroach may be even hardier than you realize  a decapitated cockroach can survive in its headless state for weeks unlike a human being a roach with its head cut off wont bleed to death thats because the roachs blood  or more accurately its hemolymph  is at a much lower pressure than the blood in our circulatory systems and the cockroach actually breathes through every segment of its body except the head so decapitation wont even deprive it of oxygen roaches also require much less food than humans or other warmblooded animals do a roach can live for weeks on a single meal so a decapitated roach probably wont be in any immediate danger of starvation i guess what im saying is put those plans for a cockroach guillotine on hold because as satisfying as it would be to go frenchrevolution on them a little shoe leather is still the best way to take them out112k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to date related questions more answers below how can a roach live without its head for weeks what makes a cockroach live for one week without its head how long does a cockroach survive without its head which insect can live without its head and for how many days why did it die at the last day why do cockroaches die on their backs ask new question babruh ardana answered jan 5 2018 · author has 193 answers and 148k answer viewsnickys answers better than mine but ive already typed it all insects can live for a bit without their head just as long as they dont need to eat some insects use a lot of energy so have to eat multiple times a day and if you cant see and smell to find your way to food and youre an insect like that then youre buggered all of our brain stuff goes on in our heads which is why decapitation will usually kill vertebrates if you leave the basal ganglia intact you can still breathe and circulate your blood and you can still be fed thru your throat a chicken lived for years like that once perfectly happily but insects have a completely different kind of brain its all along their body like their breathing and circulatory systems and the bit in the head isnt responsible for keeping them moving in fact one of the things it mainly does is inhibit other instincts stop movement you cut off their heads when you want to force them to breed and you dont care if they survive beyond that cockroaches are a very primitive kind of insect so have fewer needs than other insects but theyre not really that resilient that factoid you know about how cockroaches can survive a nuclear holocaust is also a bit misleading any adult insect thats exposed to radiation like that will be fine most of the time because they dont replace the cells of their bodies as much as vertebrates do so ionizing the molecules of them doesnt do as much harm as it does to us errors arent copied as much also they usually dont live long enough to accumulate damage fruit flies can take 10 much as much radiation as cockroaches231 views · view upvoters quora user magister ludi study the glass bead game answered nov 28 2012 · author has 79 answers and 78k answer views even for a cockroach it is not living if there is no head the cockroach is merely displaying residual neurological responses to external stimuli it is grotesque to call that living33k views · view upvoters
