ntki full member posts 335joined 8222005posted 13324 am 2262007kumas almost 2 now and hes always had this share of accidents its pretty hitandmiss with him in terms of if hell hold his pee long enough to go outside if he drinks about a cup a cup and a half of water he can maybe hold it in for 2 hours before he starts peeing in the house unless i take him out whichever comes first but sometimes hell just pee in the house if hes had about half a cup or less than that in about an hour an hour and a half he weighs about 16lbs and i dont know if his size correlates to the amount hes drankhow long he should be able to hold it i cant be taking him out every hour on the hour and i dont know how i can make him realize that he has to hold his pee in and not go everytime he feels a small urge to i dont know hes been through crate training but i feel like hes regressing a lot could it be because ive relocated recently i dont suspect uti because hes fine when hes crated if he starts peeing in the house i can never say no and stop himpick him up because if i pick him up or startle him hell end up drizzling pee all over the carpet and id just rather him finish in one spot should i give him a treat whenever he pees outside should i put him on a more stringent crating schedulethelifeofriley senior member posts 5766joined 4112005posted 74959 am 2262007once dogs are out of puppy stage there is no excuse for peeing in the house in my house anyway unless theres a problem of course i dont care if they drink a gallon of water go outside id regress right along with him and treat him like a new puppy crate him only take him out to potty eat and a couple play times a day etc take him to pee out after eating drinking waking up and playing tell him to go potty and when he does treat him make him walk to the door dont carry him etc etc basically retrain himhttpwwwashleyspetscom a dog is not almost human and i know of no greater insult to the canine race than to describe it as such minniyar moderator posts 9563joined 1062003posted 80218 am 2262007i think personally that if you really want him housetrained you have to be willing to clean up bigger messes when he drizzles in the house its more of a mess initially but think about it is it more of a mess for him to do this a few times or for him to keep wizzing at will wherever he wants if you need to keep a towel handy and when you startle him with a sudden no when he starts going quickly pick him up and tuck the towel in under his belly so hes peeing on it instead of the floor you really must interrupt him let him know immediately that it is very very bad to pee in the house every single time and you have to be willingable to catch him every single time i think that because you are letting him finish to save yourself a cleanup hes thinking its ok i would never tolerate a dog peeing at will in the house after 6 months old if he can hold it in the crate for more than 3 hours then he can most definitely hold it everywhere else for the same amount of time he apparently sees his crate as the den but not your entire house he should see your entire house as the den thats how good housetraining works back to basics for potty training keep him on a leash at all times when you catch him pick him up immediately with the towel handy to take him outside let him know you are mad with him refuse to pet him or play with him outside until he goes and keep him outside until he goes when he does finally go treat and reward him with a fun play session so he knows you are pleased and such is he neutered i totally cant even remmeber never trust a tall dwarf hes lying about somethingjoce senior member posts 1931joined 1232004posted 120049 pm 2262007when i have caught my dogs going they turn it off immediately could he possibly have a prostate issue if i have any beliefs about immortality it is that certain dogs i have known will go to heaven and very very few persons james thurberntki full member posts 336joined 8222005posted 122725 pm 2262007thanks for the advice i guess the crating is on joce i dont think he has a prostate issue i thought inflamed prostates gave them trouble urinating  its something hes done since he was a puppyrescuepupsfull member posts 187joined 11282006posted 62926 pm 2262007if he isnt neutered definitely do that it could be a marking territory problem as well as a houstraining one smaller dogs often tend to mark more than larger dogs obviously not true in all cases but in quite a few definitely do not let him finish before you clean it up this is something you cannot let him get away with like everyone else said before go back to the beginning of training and start over he should easily be able to hold it good luck hes your friendyour partneryour defenderyour dog youre his lifehis lovehis leader he will be faithful and true to the last beat of his heart you owe it to him to be worthy of such devotionntki full member posts 337joined

know it sometimes takes the smaller breeds a little longer but any ideas when i should expect her to hold herself she does really well in the crate while im working shes mostly good running around at home but she still needs to go very often its still my hope to someday give her free reign of the house while im away but am i reaching too far like i said i know shes still a pup and were a long ways away from that but i can always dreamright
