wondering whats the fastest fighting game the gameplay not the quickness of the match i mean the reaction time how quick do you have to be to pull off a move stuff like that  for me i was going to pick melee because its just a hair faster then brawl to me but the past few days ive been playing this is my choiceno question the amount of time to attack dodge and hityou have to as quick as sonic

write up a wot but im too lazy atm but overall things like tripping as well as certain questionable physics changes in brawl from melee and many things from melee being removed when they didnt need to be things that were intentional since smash64 like lcancelling or keeping the momentum from a run transferred to your characters jump hence the reason falcon in melee had one hell of a long jump when he jumped from a run which makes way more sense than most characters in brawl who tend to feel like they hit the brakes in the air soon as they jump sonic being the biggest example are all why i just cant say brawl and melees physics and depth as a fighter are equal and its not just mk that is the problem with brawls balance unfortunately while the whole game would most certainly be better with him just staying banned in tournaments there are still lots of other problems with brawls balance some caused almost strictly from some of the physics changes alone with the ability to cancel hitstun in brawl for instance with an aerial or airdodge after a short number of frames it basically turned brawls combo game to nearly 0 with only a few true followups in the game usually at low damage only which along with a lack of lcancelling really hurt some characters who relied heavily on their followups in melee eo i better stop there before i do end up writting a wot later folks to the bar i go

you can hit the r button and stop and then you cant move anymore and come down in brawl you can do it multiple times its all suggestive but i like how in brawl you can do that it creates more air combat mk your right on that one brawlz sep 29 2012captainkeeta125no longer a noob joined may 11 2011messages 5305date posted sep 29 2012 37dragonbrawlz said ↑johnnynecktie said ↑dragonbrawlz said ↑it

honestly dont find anything wrong with the gameplay of brawl or melee other then melee being a hair faster its the same to me it helps when youre part ofwere part of the tournament scene of both games and can spot all the differences at first glance things do seem the same but its when you really delve deeper into the mechanics that you start to see all the changes made to most noncompetitive players the only real change they notice is tripping and the slower speed but soon as you actually take some time to really get into the mechanics of both games and understand how both are played at a higher level as fighters the changes become more apparent suddenly the lack of lcancelling long jumping etc in brawl becomes more apparent as well as the more campy nature of the game compared to melee edit in response to the above actually the air combat is more prevalent in melee once again thanks to lcancelling and the fact that you cant cancel the hitstun in the air like in brawl watch some tournament level videos of melee 90 of the time the combos are all aerial based last edited sep 29 2012captainkeeta125 sep 29 2012last edited by captainkeeta125 sep 29 2012brawlz super star
