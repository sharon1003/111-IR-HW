how to do big strings in arduinoarduino programming add comments jun192008arduino makes it pretty easy to store  use character strings but those strings compete with your variables so you can’t do as much here’s how to put big strings into readonly program memory and use them lots of sketches can have big strings in them maybe you’ve built a little commandline interface or you’re storing small web pages for netconnected arduinos normally you do something like thischar hellostr   htmlheadtitlehello worldtitlehead bodyp aligncenterh1hello worldh1p bodyhtml  and then sometime later serialprintln  hellostr the problem with this is that “hellostr” is stored in ram along with your variables the atmega chip in arduino only has 1k b of ram if your code is getting complex and you’re using big strings and lots of libraries you may start having mysterious problems arduino can’t warn you if your sketch starts using too much ram instead you can use progmem or program memory to store your strings that is the flash rom memory that your code lives in using progmem strings can be tricky but here’s a little function called “print prog str ” to make it almost as easyconst char hellostr  progmem    notice added const and progmem  given a progmem string use serialprint  to send it out void print prog str const progchar str   char c if str return while  c  pgmreadbyte str serialprint cbyte   and then at some point print prog str  hellostr if you have another use for the string that isn’t “serialprint ” just create your own function and put whatever percharacter handling function in there instead posted by todbot at 1008 pm one response to “how to do big strings in arduino”gareth evans says12 february 2012 at 224 am i use thischar pbuffer 80 define p str strcpyp pbuffer pstr str pbuffermake sure pbuffer is large enough for the largest string then just wrap all your static strings in p  like this serialprint p “i am a string which is saved in progmem”leave a reply your comment you may use these html tags and attributes a href title abbr title acronym title b blockquote cite cite code del datetime em i q cite s strike strongname requiredemail requireduri
