e harmony online dating startups and companies the worst thing online dating what are the 3 worst things about e harmonyad by boomerang for gmail ever wonder how your emails are coming across boomerang respondable uses ai to give you realtime advice on how to improve your emails learn more at boomeranggmailcom3 answers anonymous answered oct 25 2017the emails are annoying for some matches you get this image and you can’t tell if the person just hasn’t uploaded a photo yet which why would i bother clicking through to a person who hasn’t filled out their profile completely ain’t nobody got time for that or if they do this on purpose in this case rory does indeed have a profile image but all i get is this random silhouette so i think they do matches a disservice by using a default avatar it lends the impression that this user hasn’t finished his profile so i typically don’t waste my time with inactive users not really appealing i have no idea why they do that for one off matches it’s annoying even more annoying still any time you click a match from your email even if you’re already logged to e harmony and surfing their site it requires you to log in again every time you click a match yes every time so you get matched with 5 guys 3 look appealing you click 3 faces and each browser tab opens with a login screen who doesn’t love to login 3 times even though you were already logged in 5 minutes ago browsing yesterday’s matches maybe it’s for security hmm my bank has a better user experience than this and they have every reason to fear getting hacked this website isn’t cheap either which i’ll get to so you’d think someone in development would have considered this maybe they have but please fix it had a lot of difficulty with their mobile app was also unable to read previous messages sent and for a month my matches were not receiving my messages nor was i receiving theirs when i contacted customer service about the issue they acknowledged it was a problem but they wanted me to spend hours explaining the problemissues they were already aware of it took over a month for them to rectify their internal messaging problem i requested a full refund but they tried to deny my request eventually went through apple to get refund all matches were also from out of country or 1000 km away there are too many scammers on e harmony one scammer tried to scam me and didnt work because im too smart for that i texted him back via e harmony site said he is a scammer only one text message to him then e harmony closed my account as well as scammers account i contacted e harmony many times and no response from them i already paid my membership already  lost my subscription money i finally met my significant other on mm its’s an exclusive dating app you may try13k

schamenek salsa instructor answered mar 18 2012 · author has 1k answers and 13m answer views assuming they still follow the same practices as they did 5 years ago… 1 they do not give you your matches as they join they slowly dish out your matches over a period of months i cant tell you how many girls i literally just was introduced to after being a member for 2 years… a girl who said she was about to quit e harmony after her year is up thats fraudulent they should have introduced me to her the instant she first signed up just think about e harmonys hook we carefully choose your matches based on compatibility so when you join you should literally be introduced to every single person in their database that is compatible with you it could be hundreds or even thousands of people possibly more then every single person you are introduced to thereafter must be a brand new day one e harmony subscriber if they dont do this they are defrauding you out of every person on their website who is compatible with you frankly im surprised there hasnt been a class action lawsuit yet 2 they do not care about appearance enough in fact they try to force us to think that appearance should be important at all 3 i know that there was something else i hated about e harmony but ill leave this answer at this e harmony suffers the same problem all online matchmaking services have you approach romance in reverse we are evolutionarily designed to meet someone in person and to get to know them over time built a foundation of mutual physical attraction you feel a physical attraction first then you build a romance on that online dating necessarily reverses this getting to know someone before you know whether or not there is chemistry and i say this as someone who really tried to get into the e harmony spirit i finally met one girl who was amazingly compatible with me… on paper we emailed and talked over a period of about 6 months then i flew to florida to meet her i knew right as i first laid eyes on her in person i just wasted 6 months of my life and she knew it too zero chemistry but we were perfect for each other we barely even emailed each other after that other annoyances • their website is freaking bugggggy • their standards for compatibility seem to be entirely too high as if you have to be 99 compatible before they will match you up • taking that into consideration their algorithm isnt as accurate as they think so the result is a trickle of matches that typically arent very compatible they should guarantee you a certain number of matches per month and give you a refundcredit based on the number that they didnt give you • take the test twice be as honest as you possibly can both times you will end up with entirely different results both times both results will be true about you but they will give you completely different types of matches e harmony is making one of the most important decisions in your entire life based on a horribly defective test • the way e harmony introduces you encourages compatible guys and girls to drop you for stupid reasons • its frikkin expensive it wasnt worth it for me to stay a member and i had one of their best deals ever… 12 a month paid on a per month basis i cant believe people pay like 50 a month dang theres a bunch and i think this is just the tip of the iceberg of the things that suck about e harmony69k views ·

i would imagine that some of those questions are redundant and provide no new information  and it puts a strain on the person filling them in its possible that they do this on purpose though  answering more questions makes it feel like its easier the whole usp of e harmony  that it finds the matches for you puts some people off they want to scan through profiles themselves and choose  not have an algorithm choose for them related to that if you live in a less densely populated area or at least not populated with e harmony users ive heard that it will often say that it has found no matches for you if you didnt rely on the algorithm you could find many more matches but thats the point of the algorithm32k views related questions is e harmony free communication weekend really free
