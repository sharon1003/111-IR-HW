eczema steroid treatment and insulin resistance our story my daughter was diagnosed with eczema as a toddler a respected dermatologist recommended the usual treatment fewer baths mild soap aveeno® bath oil and steroid ointment as she grew her eczema got worse in spite of treatment she became allergic to aveeno the moisturizers the doctor recommended werent effective and stung her sensitive skin i found myself applying the steroid ointment on more and more of her body without any real improvement when i became concerned about the longterm effects of using steroids on so much of my daughters skin the doctor assured me i had no need to worry because there were no real dangers at age 8 or so my daughter who had always been a thin child began to gain weight when her weight gain didnt respond to a lowercalorie diet i began to suspect diabetes i took her to an endocrinologist who confirmed that my daughter had insulin resistance—also known as prediabetes or metabolic syndrome i learned that longterm topical steroid treatment can cause permanent changes in the way the body uses sugars and fats leading to insulin resistance or even type 2 diabetes ive spent five years researching the links between eczema steroid treatment and diabetes i wrote this page to help people with eczema understand these links and learn safer ways to control eczema and insulin resistance with diet and nutrition eczema topical steroids and diabetes a vicious circle the risks of longterm steroid treatment with nutritional guidelines for managing eczema and insulin resistance by nina birnbaum summaryoveruse of topical steroids for eczema control may lead to insulin resistance or diabetes while having no effect on the underlying biochemical causes of eczema a simple program of nutritional support addresses a root cause of both eczema and insulin resistance and offers a safe alternative for controlling them please see the notes and references section for further reading introduction what causes eczema contact eczema infant and childhood eczema food allergies and eczema the dangers of steroid therapy for eczema control a safer way to manage eczema and support healthy insulin metabolism a nutritional supplement program to help manage eczema and insulin resistance basic supplement plan fof managing eczema and insulin resistance introductionif you are reading this page you or your child has probably been diagnosed with eczema you have a lot of company according to the national institutes of health up to 20 percent of infants and young children experience symptoms of eczema and about 60 percent of these children go on to have eczema as adults about 15 million adults in the united states suffer from eczema 1a google search for eczema brings up nearly 85 million pages the wikipedia page actually provides a pretty good overview here are two sites that in my opinion offer some of the best information available derm net nz new zealand an overview of eczema can be found here a more detailed guide to different types of eczema and dermatitis including pictures of eczema can be found at derm net nz an informative page from the national institutes of health can be downloaded as a pdf eczema is commonly treated with topical ointments or creams containing steroid hormones known as corticosteroids or glucocorticoids these medications reduce the symptoms of eczema—the inflammation and itching—by mimicking natural inflammationreducing hormones produced in the body by the adrenal glands however steroids absorbed through the skin can cause both immediate and longterm changes in the functioning of the adrenal glands leading to insulin resistance and possibly steroidinduced diabetes 2 3while topical steroids are generally quite effective at reducing the signs and symptoms of eczema they do not cure its underlying causes what causes eczema a healthy body produces natural oils that form a skin barrier that keeps skin soft and slightly acidic p h between 45 and 6 depending on age with an optimum at around 55 helping skin to resist infection by diseasecausing bacteria when the body is unable to produce these natural oils the skin becomes very dry and the skin barrier is damaged exposing the skin to infection 4 to make matters worse the bodys immune system may overreact to common substances causing inflammation and further damaging the skin 5current research focuses on why the body is unable to produce these natural oils central to this research is an enzyme called delta6dehydrogenase d6d which converts the linoleic acid in dietary vegetable fats into gamma linolenic acid gla an essential fatty acid necessary for maintaining healthy skin 6 more on d6d and gla later in both eczema and diabetes the d6d enzyme may be impairedit may not function properly 7 8 levels of the specific vitamins and minerals required for d6d to function are often very low in people with eczema or diabetes 915 nutritional supplementation to increase the levels of these nutrients may reduce or eliminate the symptoms of eczema and help stabilize insulin and glucose metabolism 1521contact eczemacontact eczema also called contact dermatitis or allergic dermatitis is not the same thing as atopic eczema contact eczema is caused by external factors such as dust metals fabrics or chemicals it can usually be cleared up with a short course of a steroid ointment further breakouts can be prevented by avoiding—if possible—the offending substance however many people with atopic dermatitis are also prone to contact eczema 1 21infant and childhood eczemaa zinc deficiency may be misdiagnosed as eczema when a breastfed baby develops eczema the mothers diet is often suspected as the cause however the eczema may have nothing to do with food breast milk is often low in zinc 22 and a sign of zinc deficiency is dry irritated skin 23 low levels of magnesium may contribute to dry skin as well 24 providing zinc and magnesium supplements to mother or baby may solve the problem 25 be sure to talk to your babys doctor about correct dosing before giving your baby a vitamin supplement formulafed babies may also be deficient in vitamins or in essential fatty acids 2527 some babies may not be able to utilize the vitamins and fats in baby formula or the formula itself may not provide enough of them before exposing your baby to steroid drugs talk to your doctor or a knowledgeable nutritionist about supplementing safe levels of vitamins and essential fatty acids—especially docosahexaenoic acid dha and gla bathing your baby with epsom salts magnesium sulfate or dead sea salts is a safe way to reduce inflammation 28 and supplement with magnesium which is wellabsorbed through the skin 29 at the same time a special kind of zinc can also be applied as a topical cream for absorption through the skin be sure to use a good fragrancefree baby oil after the bath to hold moisture in the skin food allergies and eczemafood allergies may cause eczema in infants and children about 30 of infants and children with atopic dermatitis test positive for food allergies 3032 a baby or child has a much greater chance of developing food allergies if either of the parents have allergies themselves the most common allergens include cows milk soy egg wheat peanuts and shellfish in breastfed babies allergens from foods may pass directly to the child through breast milk 30 avoiding these foods while breastfeeding may keep the child from developing eczema or other allergic reactions the la leche league has an excellent page on allergies and breastfeeding  in formulafed babies changing the formula may eliminate the problem special easytodigest hydrolyzed formulas formulas where the proteins are partially broken down are often recommended for formulafed babies with food allergies adding probiotics or prebiotics beneficial bacteria that live in the gut and help digest foodto infant diets helps to reduce or prevent both food allergies and other illnesses 3335breastfeeding longer introducing solid foods late after 6 months introducing new foods one at a time and waiting to introduce allergenic foods until after the baby is about a year old help reduce the risk of allergic reactions most babies outgrow early allergies to milk and eggs although peanut allergy is more likely to persist to adulthood however children with food allergies are more likely to develop asthma or other atopic diseases when they grow older if you suspect a food allergy in your baby or child talk to your doctor a food elimination diet should only be utilized under a doctors supervision to limit the risk of nutrient deficiency the dangers of steroid therapy for eczema controllongterm treatment with topical steroids can lead to insulin resistance prediabetesand worsened eczema today the most common treatment for eczema is a topical steroid cream or ointment these are very cheap—a big tube of triamcinolone® an oftenprescribed drug is about 10 and because they are potent antiinflammatories they are very effective at clearing up the inflammation however because of their side effects they are only safe for very shortterm use two newer drugs elidel® and protopic® are based on a different technology and dont contain steroids when they were introduced they were considered miracle drugs because they didnt have the side effects of steroids however it was soon discovered that they had a whole different set of side effects in 2006 both elidel and protopic were given black box warnings—the fdas strongest warning—about a possible cancer connection despite the risks topical steroids are often used for the longterm control of eczema even in young children this can start a chain of events that eventually leads to diabetes—and ironically worsened eczema how topical steroids can cause insulin resistance glucocorticoids are the class of steroid drugs used to treat eczema they work by interfering with the chemicals the body uses to signal inflammation steroids turn off the inflammation response and cause tiny blood vessels called capillaries to constrict reducing redness and swelling topical steroids also suppress the bodys immune system 36 which is one reason they can lead to an increased susceptibility to fungal or bacterial infections of the skin high levels of steroids may be absorbed through the skin during steroid therapy for eczema 36 37 which is where the trouble starts children absorb proportionately more of the drugs because their skin is thinner and because they have more skin surface area relative to their body mass 36because the synthetic glucocorticoid hormones used in topical steroid medicines mimic the bodys own hormones longterm use can permanently damage the bodys own ability to produce these necessary hormones 38 glucocorticoid hormones are essential to regulating the bodys ability to convert sugars and fats into the energy needed by every cell in the body if this regulatory function is impaired the body is unable to maintain the delicate balance between insulin and glucose resulting in insulin resistance or diabetes insulin resistance inhibits d6d enzyme activity leading to eczema insulin resistance inhibits d6d enzyme activity 39 as mentioned above d6d is responsible for one of the most important chemical reactions in the body producing the essential fatty acid gla gla is one of the most important substances in the body it is essential for the healthy functioning of the nervous system the brain and the heart gla helps control inflammation it also plays an important part in creating a healthy skin barrier between the body and the outside world when the d6d enzyme cant produce gla diabetes allergies asthma and eczema  as well as heart disease eye diseases rheumatoid arthritis osteoporosis and cancer may be the result 40how to recognize steroidinduced insulin resistance cushings syndrome is a group of symptoms caused by too much of the hormone cortisol in the blood and is a welldocumented side effect of steroid therapy 3641 symptoms include weight gain especially around the stomach and face insulin resistance acanthosis nigricans see below    and eczema a complete list of symptoms and information can be found on the web page of the national adrenal diseases foundation link httpwwwnadfusdiseasescushingshtm acanthosis nigricans may be misdiagnosed as eczema acanthosis nigricans a warning sign of insulin resistanceis generally caused by too much insulin in the blood rarely it may be caused by a tumor it appears as dark thickened skin most often on the back of the neck it may also appear on or near the armpits inner elbows knees or hands eczema tends to occur in these places as well explaining why acanthosis nigricans can be confused with eczema depending on the degree of insulin resistance acanthosis nigricansmay range from slightly pigmented skin to skin that is very dark thick and cracked acanthosis nigricans may be misdiagnosed as eczema even by experienced dermatologists such misdiagnosis is easy to understand when you see a definition of eczema like this one from web md patches of chronically itchy dry thickened skin usually on the hands neck face and legs in children the inner creases of the knees and elbows are often involved skin lesions patches of redness scaling and in darkskinned people changes in skin color acanthosis nigricans may be a warning sign of steroidinduced insulin resistance my daughters dermatologist failed to recognize her acanthosis nigricans for years and simply prescribed more hydrocortisone ointment which may have made the underlying insulin resistance worse if your or your childs eczema does not respond to topical steroids suspect acanthosis nigricans and see an endocrinologist immediately nearly every discussion of acanthosis nigricans associates it with obesity but anyone with insulin resistance may develop this condition whether obese or not acanthosis nigricans is more common in people with darker skin good pictures and descriptions of acanthosis nigricans can be found on the visual dx website acanthosis nigricans can also appear on the hand as shown here on medline plus acanthosis nigricans often responds quickly to changes in the bodys insulin status as a result it may be a useful diagnostic tool for figuring out whether insulin resistance is improving or worsening a safer way to manage eczema and support healthy insulin metabolismlow levels of zinc magnesium and selenium often accompany eczema and insulin resistance 915 these nutrients along with some of the b vitamins especially b6 are necessary for the d6d enzyme to work properly and produce the essential fatty acid gla recent research shows that vitamin d is also extremely important in the development and management of both eczema and diabetes 4244its interesting that the same group of vitamins and minerals are essential for both optimal d6d function and optimal insulin metabolism supplementation with these vitamins and minerals may be a safe way to help manage both eczema and insulin resistance by following this regimen you may be able to stop or reduce your use of topical steroids or insulinregulating drugs my recommended diet and supplement regimen provides support for d6d enzyme activity as well as a direct source of gla other vitamins and minerals are included to provide balanced nutrition the amounts listed are within the united states recommended dietary allowances or if higher have extensive research to support the higher doses eat a healthy lowcarbohydrate highprotein diet avoid refined sugar fried foods white rice and highly processed foods made with white flour eat a variety of whole grains including brown rice barley quinoa whole oats and buckwheat these grains are all high in healthy fiber magnesium b vitamins and protein limit unhealthy fats in the diet from fried foods and margarine and replace with healthy fats in olive oil coconut oil a good source of mediumchain triglycerides which may be helpful in controlling weight gain in diabetes 45 and fish oils epa and dha for vegetarians the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid epa in fish oil can be found in flax hemp or perilla oils algae provide a vegetarian source of the essential fatty acid dha and can be found in vegetarian dha supplements eat plenty of vegetables limit fruit juice which is mostly sugar and eat seasonal fruit instead avoid soft drinks diet soft drinks and highsugar drinks of all kinds instead drink tea water or for something sweet a blend of fruit juice and water eat foods high in magnesium zinc and b vitamins a list of highmagnesium foods can be found at httpwwwvaughns1pagerscomfoodmagnesiumfoodshtm b vitamins and zinc are found mostly in meat so vegetarians may not get enough in their diet high levels of b vitamins and zinc are often found together in the same foods httpohiolineosueduhygfact50005560html a nutritional supplement program to help manage eczema and insulin resistancesupplement safety guidelines notify your doctor before starting on a diet and nutrition program especially if you are taking any prescription medications if your doctor refuses to work with you or strongly discourages use of any nutritional supplements i recommend finding a different doctor a nutritionist can also help you use drugs and supplements together safely vitamin supplements and drugs may interact with eachother so its a good idea to check first an extensive database of drugvitamin interactions can be found on the university of maryland website an interaction does not necessarily mean that you cant use the supplement it does mean that you should be careful and do so with your doctors supervision a supplement may even reduce your need for certain drugs for instance both magnesium and chromium can reduce the need for diabetes and heart medicines to safely use supplements and drugs together start with a low dose of the supplement and work up to the full dose have your doctor test you and adjust your medication as necessary test test test testing is important when using drugs or supplements to control a disease or condition drugs can raise or lower the levels of key nutrients in your body and taking drugs and supplements together may affect nutrient levels differently supplement dosages need to be adjusted even if you are not on other medication and testing is the only way to know if you need to be taking more or less baseline testingtesting specific nutrient levels in your body before starting a supplement regimenlets you know where youre starting from continue to test once every six months at first and then at least once a year to be sure your nutrient levels are where you want them to be and adjust your supplements and medicines accordingly why not just take a multivitamin although multivitamins supposedly provide a full spectrum of vitamins and minerals their “one size fits all” formulation may not provide optimum levels of the nutrients your body needs in addition because some nutrients block the absorption of others you may not be getting the full amount of everything listed on the label and multivitamins—even expensive ones—are not necessarily made with the specific types of vitamins the human body can use most efficiently all vitamins are not created equal vitamins and minerals are available in different chemical compositions some are more bioavailable —that is they are in a chemical form thats easy for the body to use—than others often the more bioavailable vitamins are also more expensive the fda only regulates supplements for safety not potency so the old adage caveat emptor let the buyer beware definitely applies when youre buying vitamins in the list below ive included the most bioavailable chemical form of each vitamin and the brands that offer it so youll get the most from your supplement regimen disclaimer i have no ties with any of the companies that manufacture or sell the vitamins i recommend excellent information about vitamins and minerals can be found at the website of the u s office of dietary supplements and on i herbs comprehensive supplement database some nutrients lose effectiveness when taken together some nutrients interfere with the absorption of other nutrients when taken together for instance foods high in phytates chemicals found in plant foods such as whole grains a full list is here and foods high in calcium block absorption of zinc a vital part of this nutritional program so to get the most out of zinc take

prices online try iherbcom vitacostcom or valuenutritioncentercom note value nutritions shipping time can be very slow vitamin b complex i recommend jarrow bright which has the best balance of the various forms of vitamin b for additional vitamin b6 look for one that contains the most bioavailable form pyridoxal5phosphate or p5p in a 50mg or lower dose pure encapsulations kal carlson and country life active b6 are all good choices vitamin c an important antioxidant and immune booster look for ester c a patented form of vitamin c or anything that says buffered on the label there are many good brands including now and vitamin shoppe brands vitamin c can be expensive so buy on salevitamin d vitamin d which we produce naturally from sun exposure is essential to the healthy functioning of every organ in the body vitamin d deficiency has become an epidemic of modern indoor living so a supplement is necessary look for naturally sourced from lanolin or fish liver oil vita min d3 cholecalciferol which is the type of vitamin d made in skin in response to sunlight it is more biologically active than vitamin d2  ergocalciferol  however it is not vegetarian vegetarians should use vitamin d2 which is derived from plant sources and will be labeled vegetarian vitamin d for the latest research on vitamin d go to vitamin dcouncilorg vitamin e an important antioxidant needed to balance the essential fatty acids dha epa and gla in the supplement plan look for any brand of natural vitamin e with mixed tocopherals do not take the synthetic forms called dl alpha tocopheral or vitamin e acetate vitamin shoppe carries a natural source vitamin e at a good price borage oil borage oil is the highestpotency source of gla unfortunately its extremely expensive look for a coldpressed hexanefree oil barleans and health from the sun borage oil 300 are both cold pressed both companies offer a liquid borage oil which may cost slightly less per dose dhaepa oil blend i recommend nordic naturals arctic cod liver oil which has a higher ratio of dha to epa and is available in capsules or liquid vegetarians may need to use two products an organic flax hemp or perilla seed supplement for the omega3 essential fatty acids and a vegetarian source of dha such as neuromins® good vegetarian omega3dha blends are floras dha flax oil and now foods omega supreme which also contains gla however you need to take much more of the vegetarian products to equal the amount of efas in the nordic naturals product calcium look for any brand made from 100 calcium citrate citracal® a drugstore brand is a good source some calcium supplements have been found to contain high levels of lead to avoid lead avoid calcium supplements made from oyster shells bone meal or dolomite magnesium the most bioavailable form of magnesium is magnesium glycinate which is most easily absorbed and wont upset your stomach look for doctors best high absorption magnesium kal solaray or metagenics mag glycinate the wrong form of magnesium can cause severe upset stomachlaxatives are commonly made with magnesium citrate so you want to avoid that form other common forms such as magnesium oxide are not well absorbed potassium any brand of potassium citrate is fine potassium only comes in 99mg doses if you dont eat a lot of vegetables or if you have diabetes or insulin resistance you may need to supplement with up to 600 mg of potassium daily a baked potato contains about 600 mg of potassium a cup of cooked spinach about 800 mg have your doctor test your potassium levels to be sure youre getting the right amount selenium look for any brand as lselenomethionine a great natural source of selenium is brazil nuts which may contain anywhere from 50100 mcg of selenium per nut since brazil nuts contain a variable amount of selenium dont eat more than 2 per day on a regular basis to avoid excessive selenium buildup brazil nuts go rancid very quickly so purchase them from a store with high turnover and keep them in the freezer to prevent rancidity bite a corner from each nut before eating the whole thing to be sure its good zinc look for any brand of zinc picolinate the most bioavailable form purchasing a lowerdose zincaround 25 mg rather than 50 mgwill allow you to regulate your dose more effectively too much zinc can reduce levels of copper another essential nutrient once again testingboth zinc and copperis key to balancing these nutrients  back to top
