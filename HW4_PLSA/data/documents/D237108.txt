genshiryoku hatsudensho jiko was an energy accident at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant in ōkuma fukushima prefecture initiated primarily by the tsunami following the tōhoku earthquake on 11 march 2011 6 immediately after the earthquake the active reactors automatically shut down their sustained fission reactions however the tsunami disabled the emergency generators that would have provided power to control and operate the pumps necessary to cool the reactors the insufficient cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns hydrogenair explosions and the release of radioactive material in units 1 2 and 3 from 12 march to 15 march loss of cooling also caused the pool for storing spent fuel from reactor 4 to overheat on 15 march due to the decay heat from the fuel rods on 5 july 2012 the fukushima nuclear accident independent investigation commission naiic found that the causes of the accident had been foreseeable and that the plant operator tokyo electric power company tepco had failed to meet basic safety requirements such as risk assessment preparing for containing collateral damage and developing evacuation plans on 12 october 2012 tepco admitted for the first time that it had failed to take necessary measures for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants 7 8 9 10the fukushima disaster was the most significant nuclear incident since the april 26 1986 chernobyl disaster and the second disaster to be given the level 7 event classification of the international nuclear event scale 11 though there have been no fatalities linked to radiation due to the accident the eventual number of cancer deaths according to the linear nothreshold theory of radiation safety that will be caused by the accident is expected to be around 130–640 people in the years and decades ahead 12 13 14 the united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation 15 and world health organization report that there will be no increase in miscarriages stillbirths or physical and mental disorders in babies born after the accident 16 controversially however an estimated 1600 deaths are believed to have occurred primarily in the elderly who had earlier lived in nursing homes due to the resultant poor adhoc evacuation conditions 17 18 in 2017 risk analysis has determined that unlike chernobyl relocation was unjustified for the 160000 people relocated after fukushima especially considering 1600 deaths occurred due to the stressful evacuation conditions when the potential future deaths from exposure to greater amounts of radiation had everyone instead stayed home and been supported by a shelter in place there would have been fewer deaths 19 20there are no clear plans for decommissioning the plant but the plant management estimate is 30 or 40 years 21 a frozen soil barrier has been constructed in an attempt to prevent further contamination of seeping groundwater 22 but in july 2016 tepco revealed that the ice wall had failed to totally stop groundwater from flowing in and mixing with highly radioactive water inside the wrecked reactor buildings adding that they are technically incapable of blocking off groundwater with the frozen wall 23in february 2017 tepco released images taken inside reactor 2 by a remotecontrolled camera that show there is a 2meter 65 ft wide hole in the metal grating under the pressure vessel in the reactors primary containment vessel 24 which could have been caused by fuel escaping the pressure vessel indicating a meltdownmeltthru had occurred through this layer of containment radiation levels of about 210 sv per hour were subsequently detected inside the unit 2 containment vessel 25 these values are in the context of undamaged spent fuel which has typical values of 270 svh after 10years of coldshutdown with no shielding 26contents  hide 1 overview2 plant description21 cooling22 backup generators23 central fuel storage areas24 zircaloy3 prior safety concerns31 1967 layout of

separate boiling water reactors originally designed by general electric ge and maintained by the tokyo electric power company tepco at the time of the tōhoku earthquake on 11 march 2011 reactors 4 5 and 6 were shut down in preparation for refueling 27 however their spent fuel pools still required cooling 28immediately after the earthquake the electricityproducing reactors 1 2 and 3 automatically shut down their sustained fission reactions by inserting control rods in a legallymandated safety procedure referred to as scram which ceases the reactors normal running conditions as the reactors were unable to generate power to run their own coolant pumps emergency diesel generators came online as designed to power electronics and coolant systems these operated nominally until the tsunami destroyed the generators for reactors 1–5 the two generators cooling reactor 6 were undamaged and were sufficient to be pressed into service to cool the neighboring reactor 5 along with their own reactor averting the overheating issues that reactor 4 suffered 28the largest tsunami wave was 13 meters 43 ft high and hit 50 minutes after the initial earthquake overwhelming the plants seawall which was 10 m 33 ft high 6 the moment of impact was recorded by a camera 29 water quickly flooded the lowlying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed 30 the flooded diesel generators failed soon afterwards resulting in a loss of power to the critical coolant water pumps these pumps needed to continuously circulate coolant water through a generation ii reactor for several days to keep the fuel rods from melting as the fuel rods continued to generate decay heat after the scram event the fuel rods would become hot enough to melt during the fuel decay time period if an adequate heat sink was not available after the secondary emergency pumps run by backup electrical batteries ran out one day after the tsunami 12 march 31 the water pumps stopped and the reactors began to overheat meanwhile as workers struggled to supply power to the reactors coolant systems and restore power to their control rooms a number of hydrogenair chemical explosions occurred the first in unit 1 on 12 march and the last in unit 4 on 15 march 31 32 33 it is estimated that the hot zirconium fuel claddingwater reaction in reactors 1–3 produced 800 to 1000 kilograms of hydrogen gas each the pressurized gas was vented out of the reactor pressure vessel where it mixed with the ambient air and eventually reached explosive concentration limits in units 1 and 3 due to piping connections between units 3 and 4 or alternatively from the same reaction occurring in the spent fuel pool in unit 4 itself 34 unit 4 also filled with hydrogen resulting in an explosion in each case the hydrogenair explosions occurred at the top of each unit that was in their upper secondary containment buildings 35 36 drone overflights on 20 march and afterwards captured clear images of the effects of each explosion on the outside structures while the view inside was largely obscured by shadows and debris 1coinciding with the well understood implications of a loss of coolant accident the insufficient cooling eventually led to meltdowns in reactors 1 2 and 3 the full extent of the movement of the resulting corium is unknown but it is now considered to be at least through the bottom of each reactor pressure vessel rpv residing somewhere between there and the watertable below each reactor in a similar manner to what was observed at reactor 4 in chernobyl there have been no fatalities linked to short term overexposure to radiation reported due to the fukushima accident while approximately 18500 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami the maximum cancer mortality and morbidity estimate according to the linear nothreshold theory is 1500 and 1800 but with most estimates considerably lower in the range of a few hundred 37 in addition the rates of psychological distress among evacuated people rose fivefold compared to the japanese average due to the experience of the disaster and evacuation 38in 2013 the world health organization who indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to low amounts of radiation and that radiationinduced health impacts are likely to be low 39 40 in particular the 2013 who report predicts that for evacuated infant girls their 075 preaccident lifetime risk of developing thyroid cancer is calculated to be increased to 125 by being exposed to radioiodine with the increase being slightly less for males the risks from a number of additional radiationinduced cancers are also expected to be elevated due to exposure caused by the other low boiling point fission products that were released by the safety failures the single greatest increase is for thyroid cancer but in total an overall 1 higher lifetime risk of developing cancers of all types is predicted for infant females with the risk slightly lower for males making both some of the most radiationsensitive groups 40 along with those within the womb which the who predicted depending on their gender to have the same elevations in risk as the infant groups 41a screening program a year later in 2012 found that more than a third 36 of children in fukushima prefecture have abnormal growths in their thyroid glands 42 as of august 2013 there have been more than 40 children newly diagnosed with thyroid cancer and other cancers in fukushima prefecture as a whole in 2015 the number of thyroid cancers or detections of developing thyroid cancers numbered 137 43 however whether these incidences of cancer are elevated above the rate in uncontaminated areas and therefore were due to exposure to nuclear radiation is unknown at this stage  citation needed data from the chernobyl accident showed that an unmistakable rise in thyroid cancer rates following the disaster in 1986 only began after a cancer incubation period of 3–5 years 44 however whether this data can be directly compared to the fukushima nuclear disaster is yet to be determined 45a survey by the newspaper mainichi shimbun computed that of some 300000 people who evacuated the area approximately 1600 deaths related to the evacuation conditions such as living in temporary housing and hospital closures had occurred as of august 2013 a number comparable to the 1599 deaths directly caused by the earthquake and tsunami in the fukushima prefecture in 2011 the exact causes of the majority of these evacuation related deaths were not specified as according to the municipalities that would hinder application for condolence money compensation 17 18 by the relatives of the deceased on 5 july 2012 the japanese national diet appointed fukushima nuclear accident independent investigation commission naiic submitted its inquiry report to the japanese diet 46 the commission found the nuclear disaster was manmade that the direct causes of the accident were all foreseeable prior to 11 march 2011 the report also found that the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant was incapable of withstanding the earthquake and tsunami tepco the regulatory bodies  nisa and nsc and the government body promoting the nuclear power industry meti all failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements—such as assessing the probability of damage preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster and developing evacuation plans for the public in the case of a serious radiation release meanwhile the governmentappointed investigation committee on the accident at the fukushima nuclear power stations of tokyo electric power company submitted its final report to the japanese government on 23 july 2012 47 a separate study by stanford researchers found that japanese plants operated by the largest utility companies were particularly unprotected against potential tsunami 6tepco admitted for the first time on 12 october 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants 7 8 9 10 there are no clear plans for decommissioning the plant but the plant management estimate is thirty or forty years 21a frozen soil barrier was constructed in an attempt to prevent further contamination of seeping groundwater by melteddown nuclear fuel 22 but in july 2016 tepco revealed that the ice wall had failed to stop groundwater from flowing in and mixing with highly radioactive water inside the wrecked reactor buildings adding that they are technically incapable of blocking off groundwater with the frozen wall 48 23plant description  editmain article fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant site closeup map of

boiling water reactors bwrs with a combined power of 47 gigawatts making it one of the worlds 25 largest nuclear power stations it was the first gedesigned nuclear plant to be constructed and run entirely by the tokyo electric power company tepco reactor 1 was a 439 mwe type bwr3 reactor constructed in july 1967 and commenced operation on 26 march 1971 49 it was designed to withstand an earthquake with a peak ground acceleration of 018 g 14 ms 2 46 fts 2 and a response spectrum based on the 1952 kern county earthquake 50 reactors 2 and 3 were both 784 mwe type bwr4s reactor 2 commenced operation in july 1974 and reactor 3 in march 1976 the earthquake design basis for all units ranged from 042 g 412 ms 2 135 fts 2 to 046 g 452 ms 2 148 fts 2  51 52 after the 1978 miyagi

safety system nuclear reactors generate electricity by using the heat of the fission reaction to produce steam which is used to drive turbines in order to generate electricity when the reactor stops operating the radioactive decay of unstable isotopes in the fuel continues to generate heat  decay heat for a time and so require continued cooling 59 60 initially this decay heat amounts to approximately 65 of the amount produced by fission 59 decreasing over several days before reaching shutdown levels 61 afterwards spent fuel rods typically require several years in a spent fuel pool before they can be safely transferred to dry cask storage vessels 62 the decay heat in the unit 4 spent fuel pool had the capacity to boil about 70 metric tons 69 long tons 77 short tons of water per day 63in the reactor core highpressure systems cycle water between the reactor pressure vessel and heat exchangers these systems transfer heat to a secondary heat exchanger via the essential service water system using water pumped out to sea or an onsite cooling tower 64 units 2 and 3 were equipped with steam turbinedriven emergency core cooling systems that could be directly operated by steam produced by decay heat and which could inject water directly into the reactor 65 some electrical power was needed to operate valves and monitoring systems unit 1 was equipped with a different entirely passive cooling system the isolation condenser ic it consisted of a series of pipes run from the reactor core to the inside of a large tank of water when the valves are opened steam flows upward to the ic where the cool water in the tank condenses the steam back to water and it runs under gravity back to the reactor core for unknown reasons unit 1s ic was operated only intermittently during the emergency however during a 25 march 2014 presentation to the tva dr takeyuki inagaki explained that the ic was being operated intermittently to maintain reactor vessel level and to prevent the core from cooling too quickly which can increase reactor power unfortunately as the tsunami engulfed the station the ic valves were closed and could not be reopened automatically due to the loss of electrical power but could have been opened manually 66 on 16 april 2011 tepco declared that cooling systems for units 1–4 were beyond repair 67backup generators  editwhen a reactor is not producing electricity its cooling pumps can be powered by other reactor units the grid diesel generators or batteries 68 69two emergency diesel generators were available for each of units 1–5 and three for unit 6 70in the late 1990s three additional backup generators for units 2 and 4 were placed in new buildings located higher on the hillside to comply with new regulatory requirements all six units were given access to these generators but the switching stations that sent power from these backup generators to the reactors cooling systems for units 1 through 5 were still in the poorly protected turbine buildings the switching station for unit 6 was protected inside the only ge mark ii reactor building and continued to function 71 all three of the generators added in the late 1990s were operational after the tsunami if the switching stations had been moved to inside the reactor buildings or to other floodproof locations power would have been provided by these generators to the reactors cooling systems 71the reactors emergency diesel generators and dc batteries crucial components in powering cooling systems after a power loss were located in the basements of the reactor turbine buildings in accordance with ges specifications midlevel ge engineers expressed concerns relayed to tepco that this left them vulnerable to flooding 72fukushima i was not designed for such a large tsunami 73 74 nor had the reactors been modified when concerns were raised in japan and by the iaea 75fukushima ii was also struck by the tsunami however it had incorporated design changes that improved its resistance to flooding reducing flood damage generators and related electrical distribution equipment were located in the watertight reactor building so that power from the electricity grid was being used by midnight 76 seawater pumps for cooling were protected from flooding and although 3 of 4 initially failed they were restored to operation 77central fuel storage areas  editused fuel assemblies taken from reactors are initially stored for at least 18 months in the pools adjacent to their reactors they can then be transferred to the central fuel storage pond 4 fukushima is storage area contains 6375 fuel assemblies after further cooling fuel can be transferred to dry cask storage which has shown no signs of abnormalities 78zircaloy  editmany of the internal components and fuel assembly cladding are made from zircaloy because it is relatively transparent to neutrons at normal operating temperatures of approximately 300 °c 572 °f zircaloy is inert however above 1200 degrees celsius 2190 °f zirconium metal can react exothermically with water to form free hydrogen gas 79 the reaction between zirconium and the coolant produces more heat accelerating the reaction 80 in addition zircaloy can react with uranium dioxide to form zirconium dioxide and uranium metal this exothermic reaction together with the reaction of boron carbide with stainless steel can release additional heat energy thus contributing to the overheating of a reactor 81prior safety concerns  edit1967 layout of the emergencycooling system  editthe fukushima reactor control room in 1999on 27 february 2012 the nuclear and industrial safety agency ordered tepco to report its reasoning for changing the piping layout for the emergency cooling system the original plans separated the piping systems for two reactors in the isolation condenser from each other however the application for approval of the construction plan showed the two piping systems connected outside the reactor the changes were not noted in violation of regulations 82after the tsunami the isolation condenser should have taken over the function of the cooling pumps by condensing the steam from the pressure vessel into water to be used for cooling the reactor however the condenser did not function properly and tepco could not confirm whether a valve was opened1991 backup generator of reactor 1 flooded  editon 30 october 1991 one of two backup generators of reactor 1 failed after flooding in the reactors basement seawater used for cooling leaked into the turbine building from a corroded pipe at 20 cubic meters per hour as reported by former employees in december 2011 an engineer was quoted as saying that he informed his superiors of the possibility that a tsunami could damage the generators tepco installed doors to prevent water from leaking into the generator rooms the japanese nuclear safety commission stated that it would revise its safety guidelines and would require the installation of additional power sources on 29 december 2011 tepco admitted all these facts its report mentioned that the room was flooded through a door and some holes for cables but the power supply was not cut off by the flooding and the reactor was stopped for one day one of the two power sources was completely submerged but its drive mechanism had remained unaffected 832008 tsunami study ignored  editin 2007 tepco set up a department to supervise its nuclear facilities until june 2011 its chairman was masao yoshida the fukushima daiichi chief a 2008 inhouse study identified an immediate need to better protect the facility from flooding by seawater this study mentioned the possibility of tsunamiwaves up to 102 meters 33 ft headquarters officials insisted that such a risk was unrealistic and did not take the prediction seriously 84  verification neededa mr okamura of the active fault and earthquake research center  replaced in 2014 by research institute of earthquake and volcano geology ievg geological survey of japan gsj aist urged tepco and nisa to review their assumption of possible tsunami heights based on a ninth century earthquake but it was not seriously considered at that time 85 the u s nuclear regulatory commission warned of a risk of losing emergency power in 1991 nureg1150 and nisa referred to the report in 2004 no action to mitigate the risk was taken 86vulnerability to earthquakes  editjapan like the rest of the pacific rim is in an active seismic zone prone to earthquakes the international atomic energy agency iaea had expressed concern about the ability of japans nuclear plants to withstand earthquakes at a 2008 meeting of the g8s nuclear safety and security group in tokyo an iaea expert warned that a strong earthquake with a magnitude above 70 could pose a serious problem for japans nuclear power stations 87 the region had experienced three earthquakes of magnitude greater than 8 including the 869 sanriku earthquake the 1896 sanriku earthquake and the 1933 sanriku earthquake events  editfurther information timeline of the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster and 2011 tōhoku earthquake and tsunami tōhoku earthquake  editthe 90 m w tōhoku earthquake occurred at 1446 on friday 11 march 2011 with the epicenter near honshu the largest island of japan 88 it produced maximum ground gforces of 056 052 056 550 507 and 548 ms 2 180 166 and 180 fts 2 at

were dispatched to the site but were delayed by poor road conditions the first arrived at 2100 11 march 93 101 almost six hours after the tsunami struck unsuccessful attempts were made to connect portable generating equipment to power water pumps the failure was attributed to flooding at the connection point in the turbine hall basement and the absence of suitable cables 97 tepco switched its efforts to installing new lines from the grid 102 one generator at unit 6 resumed operation on 17 march while external power returned to units 5 and 6 only on 20 march 103evacuation  editthe government initially set in place a fourstage evacuation process a prohibited access area out to 3 km 19 mi an onalert area 3–20 km 19–124 mi and an evacuation prepared area 20–30 km 12–19 mi on day one an estimated 170000 people 104 were evacuated from the prohibited access and onalert areas prime minister kan instructed people within the onalert area to leave and urged those in the prepared area to stay indoors 105 106 the latter groups were urged to evacuate on 25 march 107 the 20 km 12 mi exclusion zone was guarded by roadblocks to ensure that fewer people would be affected by the radiation 108the earthquake and tsunami damaged or destroyed more than one million buildings leading to a total of 470000 people needing evacuation of the 470000 the nuclear accident was responsible

14 march a similar explosion occurred in the reactor 3 building blowing off the roof and injuring eleven people on the 15th there was an explosion in the reactor 4 building due to a shared vent pipe with reactor 3 core meltdowns  editthe amount of damage sustained by the reactor cores during the accident and the location of molten nuclear fuel  corium  within the containment buildings is unknown tepco has revised its estimates several times 114 on 16 march 2011 tepco estimated that 70 of the fuel in unit 1 had melted and 33 in unit 2 and that unit 3s core might also be damaged 115 as of 2015 it can be assumed that most fuel melted through the reactor pressure vessel rpv commonly known as the reactor core and is resting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel pcv having been stopped by the pcv concrete 116 117 118 119 in july 2017 a remotely controlled robot filmed for the first time apparently melted fuel just below the pressure vessel of unit 3 120tepco released further estimates of the state and location of the fuel in a november 2011 report 121 the report concluded that the unit 1 rpv was damaged during the disaster and that significant amounts of molten fuel had fallen into the bottom of the pcv the erosion of the concrete of the pcv by the molten fuel after the core meltdown was estimated to stop at approx 07 meters 2 ft 4 in in depth while the thickness of the containment is 76 meters 25 ft thick gas sampling carried out before the report detected no signs of an ongoing reaction of the fuel with the concrete of the pcv and all the fuel in unit 1 was estimated to be well cooled down including the fuel dropped on the bottom of the reactor fuel in units 2 and 3 had melted however less than in unit 1 and fuel was presumed to be still in the rpv with no significant amounts of fuel fallen to the bottom of the pcv  needs update the report further suggested that there is a range in the evaluation results from all fuel in the rpv none fuel fallen to the pcv in unit 2 and unit 3 to most fuel in the rpv some fuel in pcv for unit 2 and unit 3 it was estimated that the fuel is cooled sufficiently according to the report the greater damage in unit 1 when compared to the other two units was due to the longer time that no cooling water was injected in unit 1 this resulted in much more decay heat accumulating as for about 1 day there was no water injection for unit 1 while unit 2 and unit 3 had only a quarter of a day without water injection 121in november 2013 mari yamaguchi reported for associated press that there are computer simulations which suggest that the melted fuel in unit 1 whose core damage was the most extensive has breached the bottom of the primary containment vessel and even partially eaten into its concrete foundation coming within about 30 centimeters 1 ft of leaking into the ground – a kyoto university nuclear engineer said with regards to these estimates we just cant be sure until we actually see the inside of the reactors 114according to a december 2013 report tepco estimated for unit 1 that the decay heat must have decreased enough the molten fuel can be assumed to remain in pcv primary container vessel 116in august 2014 tepco released a new revised estimate that reactor 3 had a complete melt through in the initial phase of the accident according to this new estimate within the first three days of the accident the entire core content of reactor 3 had melted through the rpv and fallen to the bottom of the pcv 118 119 122 these estimates were based on a simulation which indicated that reactor 3s melted core penetrated through 12 meters 3 ft 11 in of the pcvs concrete base and came close to 26–68 centimeters 10–27 in of the pcvs steel wall 117in february 2015 tepco started the muon scanning process for units 1 2 and 3 123 124 with this scanning setup it will be possible to determine the approximate amount and location of the remaining nuclear fuel within the rpv but not the amount and resting place of the corium in the pcv in march 2015 tepco released the result of the muon scan for unit 1 which showed that no fuel was visible in the rpv which would suggest that most if not all of the molten fuel had dropped onto the bottom of the pcv – this will change the plan for the removal of the fuel from unit 1 125 126in february 2017 six years after the disaster radiation levels inside the unit 2 containment building were crudely estimated to be about 650 svh 127 the estimation was revised later to 80 svh 128 these readings were the highest recorded since the disaster occurred in 2011 and the first recorded in that area of the reactor since the meltdowns images showed a hole in metal grating beneath the reactor pressure vessel suggesting that melted nuclear fuel had escaped the vessel in that area 129 in january 2018 a remotecontrolled camera confirmed that nuclear fuel debris was at the bottom of the unit 2 pcv showing fuel had escaped the rpv the handle from the top of

the spent fuel pool might be boiling radiation inside the unit 4 control room prevented workers from staying there for long periods visual inspection of the spent fuel pool on 30 april revealed no significant damage to the rods a radiochemical examination of the pond water confirmed that little of the fuel had been damaged 132in october 2012 the former japanese ambassador to switzerland and

for several reasons deliberate venting to reduce gas pressure deliberate discharge of coolant water into the sea and uncontrolled events concerns about the possibility of a large scale release led to a 20kilometer 12 mi exclusion zone around the power plant and recommendations that people within the surrounding 20–30 km 12–19 mi zone stay indoors later the uk france and some other countries told their nationals to consider leaving tokyo in response to fears of spreading contamination 139 in 2015 the tap water contamination was still higher in tokyo compared to other cities in japan 140 trace amounts of radioactivity including iodine131 caesium134 and caesium137 were widely observed 141 142 143between 21 march and midjuly around 27 pbq of caesium137 about 84 kg or 19 lb entered the ocean with about 82 percent having flowed into the sea before 8 april 144 however the fukushima coast has some of the worlds strongest currents and these transported the contaminated waters far into the pacific ocean thus causing great dispersion of the radioactive elements the results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident in terms of radioactivity would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments on the other hand significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist due to the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil organisms that filter water and fish at the top of the food chain are over time the most sensitive to caesium pollution it is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off fukushima despite caesium isotopic concentrations in the waters off of japan being 10 to 1000 times above the normal concentrations prior to the accident radiation risks are below what is generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers 145a monitoring system operated by the preparatory commission for the comprehensive nucleartestban treaty organization ctbto tracked the spread of radioactivity on a global scale radioactive isotopes were picked up by over 40 monitoring stations 146on 12 march radioactive releases first reached a ctbto monitoring station in takasaki japan around 200 km 120 mi away the radioactive isotopes appeared in eastern russia on 14 march and the west coast of the united states two days later by day 15 traces of radioactivity were detectable all across the northern hemisphere within one month radioactive particles were noted by ctbto stations in the southern hemisphere 147 148estimates of radioactivity released ranged from 10–40 149 150 151 152 of that of chernobyl the significantly contaminated area was 10 149 12 150 of that of chernobyl 149 153 154in march 2011 japanese officials announced that radioactive iodine131 exceeding safety limits for infants had been detected at 18 waterpurification plants in tokyo and five other prefectures 155 on 21 march the first restrictions were placed on the distribution and consumption of contaminated items 156 as of july 2011 the japanese government was unable to control the spread of radioactive material into the nations food supply radioactive material was detected in food produced in 2011 including spinach tea leaves milk fish and beef up to 320 kilometres from the plant 2012 crops did not show signs of radioactivity contamination cabbage rice 157 and beef showed insignificant levels of radioactivity a fukushimaproduced rice market in tokyo was accepted by consumers as safe 157on 24 august 2011 the nuclear safety commission nsc of japan published the results of the recalculation of the total amount of radioactive materials released into the air during the accident at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station the total amounts released between 11 march and 5 april were revised downwards to 130 pbq  petabecquerels 35 mega curies for iodine131 and 11 pbq for caesium137 which is about 11 of chernobyl emissions earlier estimations were 150 pbq and 12 pbq 158 159in 2011 scientists working for the japan atomic energy agency kyoto university and other institutes recalculated the amount of radioactive material released into the ocean between late march through april they found a total of 15 pbq for the combined amount of iodine131 and caesium137 more than triple the 472 pbq estimated by tepco the company had calculated only the direct releases into the sea the new calculations incorporated the portion of airborne radioactive substances that entered the ocean as rain 160in the first half of september 2011 tepco estimated the radioactivity release at some 200 mbq megabecquerels 54 milli curies per hour this was approximately one fourmillionth that of march 161 traces of iodine131 were detected in several japanese prefectures in november 162 and december 2011 163according to the french institute for radiological protection and nuclear safety between 21 march and midjuly around 27 pbq of caesium137 entered the ocean about 82 percent before 8 april this emission represents the most important individual oceanic emissions of artificial radioactivity ever observed the fukushima coast has one of the worlds strongest currents  kuroshio current  it transported the contaminated waters far into the pacific ocean dispersing the radioactivity as of late 2011 measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments suggested that the consequences for marine life would be minor significant pollution along the coast near the plant might persist because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported to the sea by surface water crossing contaminated soil the possible presence of other radioactive substances such as strontium90 or plutonium has not been sufficiently studied recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species mostly fish caught along the fukushima coast 164 migratory pelagic species are highly effective and rapid transporters of radioactivity throughout the ocean elevated levels of caesium134 appeared in migratory species off the coast of california that were not seen prefukushima 165as of march 2012 no cases of radiationrelated ailments had been reported experts cautioned that data was insufficient to allow conclusions on health impacts michiaki kai professor of radiation protection at oita university of nursing and health sciences stated if the current radiation dose estimates are correct cancerrelated deaths likely wont increase 166in may 2012 tepco released their estimate of cumulative radioactivity releases an estimated 5381 pbq of iodine131 caesium134 and caesium137 was released 520 pbq was released into the atmosphere between 12–31 march 2011 and 181 pbq into the ocean from 26 march – 30 september 2011 a total of 511 pbq of iodine131 was released into both the atmosphere and the ocean 135 pbq of caesium134 and 136 pbq of caesium137 167 tepco reported that at least 900 pbq had been released into the atmosphere in march last year 2011 alone 168 169in 2012 researchers from the institute of problems in the safe development of nuclear energy russian academy of sciences and the hydrometeorological center of russia concluded that on march 15 2011 400 pbq iodine 100 pbq cesium and 400 pbq inert gases entered the atmosphere on that day alone 170in august 2012 researchers found that 10000 nearby residents had been exposed to less than 1 millisievert of radiation significantly less than chernobyl residents 171as of october 2012 radioactivity was still leaking into the ocean fishing in the waters around the site was still prohibited and the levels of radioactive 134 cs and 137 cs in the fish caught were not lower than immediately after the disaster 172on 26 october 2012 tepco admitted that it could not stop radioactive material entering the ocean although emission rates had stabilized undetected leaks could not be ruled out because the reactor basements remained flooded the company was building a 2400footlong steel and concrete wall between the site and the ocean reaching 100 feet 30 m below ground but it would not be finished before mid2014 around august 2012 two greenling were caught close to shore they contained more than 25000 becquerels 067 milli curies of caesium137 per kilogram 11000 bq  lb 031 μci lb the highest measured since the disaster and 250 times the governments safety limit 173 174on 22 july 2013 it was revealed by tepco that the plant continued to leak radioactive water into the pacific ocean something long suspected by local fishermen and independent investigators 175 tepco had previously denied that this was happening japanese prime minister shinzō abe ordered the government to step in 176on 20 august in a further incident it was announced that 300 metric tons 300 long tons 330 short tons of heavily contaminated water had leaked from a storage tank 177 approximately the same amount of water as one eighth 18 of that found in an olympicsize swimming pool 178 the 300 metric tons 300 long tons 330 short tons of water was radioactive enough to be hazardous to nearby staff and the leak was assessed as level 3 on the international nuclear event scale 179on 26 august the government took charge of emergency measures to prevent further radioactive water leaks reflecting their lack of confidence in tepco 180as of 2013 about 400 metric tons 390 long tons 440 short tons of water per day of cooling water was being pumped into the reactors another 400 metric tons 390 long tons 440 short tons of groundwater was seeping into the structure some 800 metric tons 790 long tons 880 short tons of water per day was removed for treatment half of which was reused for cooling and half diverted to storage tanks 181 ultimately the contaminated water after treatment to remove radionuclides other than tritium may have to be dumped into the pacific 21 tepco intend to create an underground ice wall to reduce the rate contaminated groundwater reaches the sea 182in february 2014 nhk reported that tepco was reviewing its radioactivity data after finding much higher levels of radioactivity than was reported earlier tepco now says that levels of 5 mbq 012 milli curies of strontium per liter 23 mbq  imp gal 19 mbq u s gal 610 μci imp gal 510 μciu s gal were detected in groundwater collected in july 2013 and not the 900 k bq 002 milli curies 41 mbq  imp gal 34 mbq u s gal 110 μci imp gal 92 μciu s gal that were initially reported 183 184 185on 10 september 2015 floodwaters driven by typhoon etau prompted mass evacuations in japan and overwhelmed the drainage pumps at the stricken fukushima nuclear plant a tepco spokesperson said that hundreds of metric tons of radioactive water had entered the ocean as a result 186 plastic bags filled with contaminated soil and grass were also swept away by the flood waters 187contamination in the eastern pacific  editin march 2014 numerous news sources including nbc 188 began predicting that the radioactive underwater plume traveling through the pacific ocean would reach the western seaboard of the continental united states the common story was that the amount of radioactivity would be harmless and temporary once it arrived the national oceanic and atmospheric administration measured cesium134 at points in the pacific ocean and models were cited in predictions by several government agencies to announce that the radiation would not be a health hazard for north american residents groups including beyond nuclear and the tillamook estuaries partnership challenged these predictions on the basis of continued isotope releases after 2011 leading to a demand for more recent and comprehensive measurements as the radioactivity made its way east these measurements were taken by a cooperative group of organizations under the guidance of a marine chemist with the woods hole oceanographic institution and it was revealed that total radiation levels of which only a fraction bore the fingerprint of fukushima were not high enough to pose any direct risk to human life and in fact were far less than environmental protection agency guidelines or several other sources of radiation exposure deemed safe 189 integrated fukushima ocean radionuclide monitoring project in form also failed to show any significant amount of radiation 190 and as a result authors received death threats from supporters of a fukushimainduced wave of cancer deaths across north america theory 191response  editsee also investigations into the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster government agencies and tepco were unprepared for the cascading nuclear disaster 192 the tsunami that began the nuclear disaster could and should have been anticipated and that ambiguity about the roles of public and private institutions in such a crisis was a factor in the poor response at fukushima 192 in march 2012 prime minister yoshihiko noda said that the government shared the blame for the fukushima disaster saying that officials had been blinded by a false belief in the countrys technological infallibility and were taken in by a safety myth noda said everybody must share the pain of responsibility 193according to naoto kan japans prime minister during the tsunami the country was unprepared for the disaster and nuclear power plants should not have been built so close to the ocean 194 kan acknowledged flaws in authorities handling of the crisis including poor communication and coordination between nuclear regulators utility officials and the government he said the disaster laid bare a host of an even bigger manmade vulnerabilities in japans nuclear industry and regulation from inadequate safety guidelines to crisis management all of which he said need to be overhauled 194physicist and environmentalist amory lovins said that japans rigid bureaucratic structures reluctance to send bad news upwards need to save face weak development of policy alternatives eagerness to preserve nuclear powers public acceptance and politically fragile government along with tepcos very hierarchical management culture also contributed to the way the accident unfolded moreover the information japanese people receive about nuclear energy and its alternatives has long been tightly controlled by both tepco and the government 195poor communication and delays  editthe japanese government did not keep records of key meetings during the crisis 196 data from the speedi network were emailed to the prefectural government but not shared with others emails from nisa to fukushima covering 12 march 1154 pm to 16 march 9 am and holding vital information for evacuation and health advisories went unread and were deleted the data was not used because the disaster countermeasure office regarded the data as useless because the predicted amount of released radiation is unrealistic 197 on 14 march 2011 tepco officials were instructed not to use the phrase core meltdown at press conferences 198on the evening of march 15 prime minister kan called seiki soramoto who used to design nuclear plants for toshiba to ask for his help in managing the escalating crisis soramoto formed an impromptu advisory group which included his former professor at the university of tokyo toshiso kosako a top japanese expert on radiation measurement mr kosako who studied the soviet response to the chernobyl crisis said he was stunned at how little the leaders in the prime minister’s office knew about the resources available to them he quickly advised the chief cabinet secretary yukio edano to use speedi which used measurements of radioactive releases as well as weather and topographical data to predict where radioactive materials could travel after being released into the atmosphere 199the investigation committee on the accident at the fukushima nuclear power stations of tokyo electric power company s interim report stated that japans response was flawed by poor communication and delays in releasing data on dangerous radiation leaks at the facility the report blamed japans central government as well as tepco depicting a scene of harried officials incapable of making decisions to stem radiation leaks as the situation at the coastal plant worsened in the days and weeks following the disaster 200 the report said poor planning worsened the disaster response noting that authorities had grossly underestimated tsunami risks that followed the magnitude 90 earthquake the 121meter 40 ft high tsunami that struck the plant was double the height of the highest wave predicted by officials the erroneous assumption that the plants cooling system would function after the tsunami worsened the disaster plant workers had no clear instructions on how to respond to such a disaster causing miscommunication especially when the disaster destroyed backup generators 200in february 2012 the rebuild japan initiative foundation described how japans response was hindered by a loss of trust between the major actors prime minister kan tepcos tokyo headquarters and the plant manager the report said that these conflicts produced confused flows of sometimes contradictory information 201 202 according to the report kan delayed the cooling of the reactors by questioning the choice of seawater instead of fresh water accusing him of micromanaging response efforts and appointing a small closed decisionmaking staff the report stated that the japanese government was slow to accept assistance from u s nuclear experts 203a 2012 report in the economist said the operating company was poorly regulated and did not know what was going on the operators made mistakes the representatives of the safety inspectorate fled some of the equipment failed the establishment repeatedly played down the risks and suppressed information about the movement of the radioactive plume so some people were evacuated from more lightly to more heavily contaminated places 204from 17 to 19 march 2011 us military aircraft measured radiation within a 45 km 28 mi radius of the site the data recorded 125 micro sieverts per hour of radiation as far as 25 km 155 mi northwest of the plant the us provided detailed maps to the japanese ministry of economy trade and industry meti on 18 march and to the ministry of education culture sports science and technology mext two days later but officials did not act on the information 205the data were not forwarded to the prime ministers office or the nuclear safety commission nsc nor were they used to direct the evacuation because a substantial portion of radioactive materials reached ground to the northwest residents evacuated in this direction were unnecessarily exposed to radiation according to nsc chief tetsuya yamamoto it was very regrettable that we didnt share and utilize the information itaru watanabe from the science and technology policy bureau blamed the us for not releasing the data 206data on the dispersal of radioactive materials were provided to the u s forces by the japanese ministry for science a few days after march 11 however the data was not shared publicly until the americans published their map on march 23 at which point japan published fallout maps compiled from ground measurements and speedi the same day 207 according to watanabes testimony before the diet the us military was given access to the data to seek support from them on how to deal with the nuclear disaster although speedis effectiveness was limited by not knowing the amounts released in the disaster and thus was considered unreliable it was still able to forecast dispersal routes and could have been used to help local governments designate more appropriate evacuation routes 208on 19 june 2012 science minister hirofumi hirano stated that his job was only to measure radiation levels on land and that the government would study whether disclosure could have helped in the evacuation efforts 207on 28 june 2012 nuclear and industrial safety agency officials apologized to mayor yuko endo of kawauchi village for nisa having failed to release the americanproduced radiation maps in the first days after the meltdowns all residents of this village were evacuated after the government designated it a noentry zone according to a japanese government panel authorities had shown no respect for the lives and dignity of village people one nisa official apologized for the failure and added that the panel had stressed the importance of disclosure however the mayor said that the information would have prevented the evacuation into highly polluted areas and that apologies a year too late had no meaning 209in june 2016 it was revealed that tepco officials had been instructed on 14 march 2011 not to describe the reactor damage using the word meltdown officials at that time were aware that 25–55 of the fuel had been damaged and the threshold for which the term meltdown became appropriate 5 had been greatly exceeded tepco president naomi hirose told the media i would say it was a coverup it’s extremely regrettable” 210event rating  editmain article accident rating of the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster comparison of radiation levels for different nuclear events the incident was rated 7 on the international nuclear event scale ines 211 this scale runs from 0 indicating an abnormal situation with no safety consequences to 7 indicating an accident causing widespread contamination with serious health and environmental effects prior to fukushima the chernobyl disaster was the only level 7 event on record while the three mile island accident was rated as level 5 a 2012 analysis of the intermediate and longlived radioactivity released found about 10–20 of that released from the chernobyl disaster 212 213 approximately 15 pbq of caesium137 was released 214 compared with approximately 85 pbq of caesium137 at chernobyl 215 indicating the release of 265 kilograms 58 lb of caesium137 unlike chernobyl all japanese reactors were in concrete containment vessels which limited the release of strontium90 americium241 and plutonium which were among the radioisotopes released by the earlier incident 212 215some 500 pbq of iodine131 were released 214 compared to approximately 1760 pbq at chernobyl 215 iodine131 has a half life of 802 days decaying

from radiation  editvery few cancers would be expected as a result of accumulated radiation exposures 220 221 222 even though people in the area worst affected by japans fukushima nuclear accident have a slightly higher risk of developing certain cancers such as leukemia solid cancers thyroid cancer and breast cancer 223 224estimated effective doses from the accident outside japan are considered to be below or far below the dose levels regarded as very small by the international radiological protection community 225 190in 2013 who reported that area residents who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiationinduced health effects were likely to be below detectable levels 226 227 the health risks were calculated by applying conservative assumptions including the conservative linear nothreshold model of radiation exposure a model that assumes even the smallest amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect 228 229 the report indicated that for those infants in the most affected areas lifetime cancer risk would increase by about 1 227 230 it predicted that populations in the most contaminated areas faced a 70 higher relative risk of developing thyroid cancer for females exposed as infants and a 7 higher relative risk of leukemia in males exposed as infants and a 6 higher relative risk of breast cancer in females exposed as infants 40 onethird of involved emergency workers would have increased cancer risks 40 231 cancer risks for fetuses were similar to those in 1 year old infants 41 the estimated cancer risk to children and adults was lower than infants 232these percentages represent estimated relative increases over the baseline rates and are not absolute risks for developing such cancers due to the low baseline rates of thyroid cancer even a large relative increase represents a small absolute increase in risks for example the baseline lifetime risk of thyroid cancer for females is just threequarters of one percent and the additional lifetime risk estimated in this assessment for a female infant exposed in the most affected location is onehalf of one percent— world health organization health risk

nothreshold model lnt model the accident would most likely cause 130 cancer deaths 12 13 however radiation epidemiologist roy shore countered that estimating health effects from the lnt model is not wise because of the uncertainties 233 darshak sanghavi noted that to obtain reliable evidence of the effect of lowlevel radiation would require an impractically large number of patients luckey reported that the bodys own repair mechanisms can cope with small doses of radiation 234 and aurengo stated that “the lnt model cannot be used to estimate the effect of very low doses…” 235in april 2014 studies confirmed the presence of radioactive tuna off the coasts of the pacific u s 236 researchers carried out tests on 26 albacore tuna caught prior to the 2011 power plant disaster and those caught after however the amount of radioactivity is less than that found naturally in a single banana 237 238 caesium137 and caesium134 have been noted in japanese whiting in tokyo bay as of 2016 concentration of radiocesium in the japanese whiting was one or two orders of magnitude higher than that in the sea water and an order of magnitude lower than that in the sediment they were still within food safety limits 239in june 2016 tilman ruff copresident of the political advocacy group the  international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war  argues that 174000 people have been unable to return to their homes and ecological diversity has decreased and malformations have been found in trees birds and mammals 240five years after the event the department of agriculture from the university of tokyo which holds many experimental agricultural research fields around the affected area has noted that the fallout was found at the surface of anything exposed to air at the time of the accident the main radioactive nuclides are now caesium137 and caesium134  but these radioactive compounds have not dispersed much from the point where they landed at the time of the explosion which was very difficult to estimate from our understanding of the chemical behavior of cesium 241in february 2018 japan renewed the export of fish caught off fukushimas nearshore zone according to prefecture officials no seafood had been found with radiation levels exceeding japan safety standards since april 2015 thailand is the first country to receive a shipment of fresh fish from japans fukushima prefecture 242 a group campaigning to help prevent global warming has demanded the food and drug administration disclose the name of the importer of fish from fukushima and of the japanese restaurants in bangkok serving srisuwan janya chairman of the stop global warming association said the fda must protect the rights of consumers by ordering restaurants serving fukushima fish to make that information available to their customers so they could decide whether to eat it or not 243thyroid screening program  editthe world health organization stated that a 2013 thyroid ultrasound screening program was due to the screening effect likely to lead to an increase in recorded thyroid cases due to early detection of non symptomatic disease cases 244 the overwhelming majority of thyroid growths are benign growths that will never cause symptoms illness or death even if nothing is ever done about the growth autopsy studies on people who died from other causes show that more than one third of adults technically have a thyroid growthcancer 245 as a precedent in 1999 in south korea the introduction of advanced ultrasound thyroid examinations resulted in an explosion in the rate of benign thyroid cancers being detected and needless surgeries occurring 246 despite this the death rate from thyroid cancer has remained the same 246according to the tenth report of the fukushima prefecture health management survey released in february 2013 more than 40 of children screened around fukushima prefecture were diagnosed with thyroid nodules or cysts ultrasonographic detectable thyroid nodules and cysts are extremely common and can be found at a frequency of up to 67 in various studies 247 186 05 of these had nodules larger than 51 mm 020 in andor cysts larger than 201 mm 079 in and underwent further investigation while none had thyroid cancer a russia today report into the matter was highly misleading 248 fukushima medical university give the number of children diagnosed with thyroid cancer as of december 2013 as 33 and concluded it is unlikely that these cancers were caused by the exposure from i131 from the nuclear power plant accident in march 2011 249in october 2015 137 children from the fukushima prefecture were described as either being diagnosed with or showing signs of developing thyroid cancer the studys lead author toshihide tsuda from okayama university stated that the increased detection could not be accounted for by attributing it to the screening effect he described the screening results to be 20 times to 50 times what would be normally expected 43 by the end of 2015 the number had increased to 166 children 250however despite his paper being widely reported by the media 246 an undermining error according to teams of other epidemiologists who point out tsudas remarks are fatally wrong is that tsuda did an apples and oranges comparison by comparing the fukushima surveys which uses advanced ultrasound devices that detect otherwise unnoticeable thyroid growths with data from traditional nonadvanced clinical examinations to arrive at his 20 to 50 times what would be expected conclusion in the critical words of epidemiologist richard wakeford “it is inappropriate to compare the data from the fukushima screening program with cancer registry data from the rest of japan where there is in general no such largescale screening” wakefords criticism was one of seven other authors letters that were published criticizing tsudas paper 246 according to takamura another epidemiologist who examined the results of small scale advanced ultrasound tests on japanese children not near fukushima the prevalence of thyroid cancer using the same detection technology does not differ meaningfully from that in fukushima prefecture” 246thyroid cancer is one of the most survivable cancers with an approximate 94 survival rate after first diagnosis that rate increases to a nearly 100 survival rate if caught early 251chernobyl comparison  editmain article comparison of fukushima and chernobyl nuclear accidents radiation deaths at chernobyl were also statistically undetectable only 01 of the 110645 ukraninian cleanup workers included in a 20year study out of over 500000 former soviet clean up workers had as of 2012 developed leukemia although not all cases resulted from the accident 252 253data from chernobyl showed that there was a steady then sharp increase in thyroid cancer rates following the disaster in 1986 but whether this data can be directly compared to fukushima is yet to be determined 44 45chernobyl thyroid cancer incidence rates did not begin to increase above the prior baseline value of about 07 cases per 100000 people per year until 1989 to 1991 3–5 years after the incident in both adolescent and child age groups 44 45 the rate reached its highest point so far of about 11 cases per 100000 in the decade of the 2000s approximately 14 years after the accident 44 from 1989 to 2005 an excess of 4000 children and adolescent cases of thyroid cancer were observed nine of these had died as of 2005 a 99 survival rate 254effects on evacuees  editin the former soviet union many patients with negligible radioactive exposure after the chernobyl disaster displayed extreme anxiety about radiation exposure they developed many psychosomatic problems including radiophobia along with an increase in fatalistic alcoholism as japanese health and radiation specialist shunichi yamashita noted 255we know from chernobyl that the psychological consequences are enormous life expectancy of the evacuees dropped from 65 to 58 years – not because of cancer but because of depression alcoholism and suicide relocation is not easy the stress is very big we must not only track those problems but also treat them otherwise people will feel they are just guinea pigs in our research 255a survey by the iitate local government obtained responses from approximately 1743 evacuees within the evacuation zone the survey showed that many residents are experiencing growing frustration instability and an inability to return to their earlier lives sixty percent of respondents stated that their health and the health of their families had deteriorated after evacuating while 399 reported feeling more irritated compared to before the disaster 256summarizing all responses to questions related to evacuees current family status onethird of all surveyed families live apart from their children while 501 live away from other family members including elderly parents with whom they lived before the disaster the survey also showed that 347 of the evacuees have suffered salary cuts of 50 or more since the outbreak of the nuclear disaster a total of 368 reported a lack of sleep while 179 reported smoking or drinking more than before they evacuated 256stress often manifests in physical ailments including behavioral changes such as poor dietary choices lack of exercise and sleep deprivation survivors including some who lost homes villages and family members were found likely to face mental health and physical challenges much of the stress came from lack of information and from relocation 257a survey computed that of some 300000 evacuees approximately 1600 deaths related to the evacuation conditions such as living in temporary housing and hospital closures that had occurred as of august 2013 a number comparable to the 1599 deaths directly caused by the earthquake and tsunami in the prefecture the exact causes of these evacuation

scheduled maintenance throughout the year was given to local governments who in all cases decided against according to the japan times the disaster changed the national debate over energy policy almost overnight by shattering the governments longpitched safety myth about nuclear power the crisis dramatically raised public awareness about energy use and sparked strong antinuclear sentiment an energy white paper approved by the japanese cabinet in october 2011 says public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged by the disaster and called for a reduction in the nations reliance on nuclear power it also omitted a section on nuclear power expansion that was in the previous years policy review 269michael banach the current vatican representative to the iaea told a conference in vienna in september 2011 that the disaster created new concerns about the safety of nuclear plants globally auxiliary bishop of osaka michael goro matsuura said this incident should cause japan and other countries to abandon nuclear projects he called on the worldwide christian community to support this antinuclear campaign statements from bishops conferences in korea and the philippines called on their governments to abandon atomic power author kenzaburō ōe who received a nobel prize in literature urged japan to abandon its reactors 270the nuclear plant closest to the epicenter of the earthquake the onagawa nuclear power plant successfully withstood the cataclysm according to reuters it may serve as a trump card for the nuclear lobby providing evidence that it is possible for a correctly designed and operated nuclear facility to withstand such a cataclysm 271the loss of 30 of the countrys generating capacity led to much greater reliance on liquified natural gas and coal 272 unusual conservation measures were undertaken in the immediate aftermath nine prefectures served by tepco experienced power rationing 273 the government asked major companies to reduce power consumption by 15 and some shifted their weekends to weekdays to smooth power demand 274 converting to a nuclearfree gas and oil energy economy would cost tens of billions of dollars in annual fees one estimate is that even including the disaster more lives would have been lost if japan had used coal or gas plants instead of nuclear 12many political activists have begun calling for a phaseout of nuclear power in japan including amory lovins who claimed japan is poor in fuels but is the richest of all major industrial countries in renewable energy that can meet the entire longterm energy needs of an energyefficient japan at lower cost and risk than current plans japanese industry can do it faster than anyone — if japanese policymakers acknowledge and allow it 195 benjamin k sovacool asserted that japan could have exploited instead its renewable energy base japan has a total of 324 gw of achievable potential in the form of onshore and offshore wind turbines 222 gw geothermal power plants 70 gw additional hydroelectric capacity 265 gw solar energy 48 gw and agricultural residue 11 gw 275in contrast others have said that the zero mortality rate from the fukushima incident confirms their opinion that nuclear fission is the only viable option available to replace fossil fuels journalist george monbiot wrote why fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power in it he said as a result of the disaster at fukushima i am no longer nuclearneutral i now support the technology 276 277 he continued a crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster earthquake and a vast tsunami the electricity supply failed knocking out the cooling system the reactors began to explode and melt down the disaster exposed a familiar legacy of poor design and cornercutting yet as far as we know no one has yet received a lethal dose of radiation 278 279 responses to monbiot noted his false calculation that nuclear powered electricity is needed that it can work economically and that it can solve its horrific waste decommissioning and proliferationsecurity pitfalls  along with human safety health and indeed human psychology issues 280in september 2011 mycle schneider said that the disaster can be understood as a unique chance to get it right on energy policy germany – with its nuclear phaseout decision based on a renewable energy program – and japan – having suffered a painful shock but possessing unique technical capacities and societal discipline – can be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift toward a truly sustainable lowcarbon and nuclearfree energy policy 281on the other hand climate and energy scientists james hansen ken caldeira kerry emanuel and tom wigley released an open letter calling on world leaders to support development of safer nuclear power systems stating there is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power 282 in december 2014 an open letter from 75 climate and energy scientists on the website of pronuclear advocate barry brook asserted nuclear power has lowest impact on wildlife and ecosystems — which is what we need given the dire state of the world’s biodiversity 283 brooks advocacy for nuclear power has been challenged by opponents of nuclear industries including environmentalist jim green of friends of the earth 284 brook has described the australian greens political party sa branch and australian youth climate coalition as sad and increasingly irrelevant after they expressed their opposition to nuclear industrial development 285as of september 2011 japan planned to build a pilot offshore floating wind farm with six 2 mw turbines off the fukushima coast 286 the first became operational in november 2013 287 after the evaluation phase is complete in 2016 japan plans to build as many as 80 floating wind turbines off fukushima by 2020 286 in 2012 prime minister kan said the disaster made it clear to him that japan needs to dramatically reduce its dependence on nuclear power which supplied 30 of its electricity before the crisis and has turned him into a believer of renewable energy  citation needed sales of solar panels in japan rose 307 to 1296 mw in 2011 helped by a government scheme to promote renewable energy canadian solar received financing for its plans to build a factory in japan with capacity of 150 mw scheduled to begin production in 2014 288as of september 2012 the los angeles times reported that prime minister yoshihiko noda acknowledged that the vast majority of japanese support the zero option on nuclear power 289 and prime minister noda and the japanese government announced plans to make the country nuclearfree by the 2030s they announced the end to construction of nuclear power plants and a 40year limit on existing nuclear plants nuclear plant restarts must meet safety standards of the new independent regulatory authority the plan requires investing 500 billion over 20 years 290on 16 december 2012 japan held its general election the liberal democratic party ldp had a clear victory with shinzō abe as the new prime minister abe supported nuclear power saying that leaving the plants closed was costing the country 4 trillion yen per year in higher costs 291 the comment came after junichiro koizumi who chose abe to succeed him as premier made a recent statement to urge the government to take a stance against using nuclear power 292 a survey on local mayors by the yomiuri shimbun newspaper in january 2013 found that most of them from cities hosting nuclear plants would agree to restarting the reactors provided the government could guarantee their safety 293 more than 30000 people marched on 2 june 2013 in tokyo against restarting nuclear power plants marchers had gathered more than 8 million petition signatures opposing nuclear power 294in october 2013 it was reported that tepco and eight other japanese power companies were paying approximately 36 trillion yen 37 billion dollars more in combined imported fossil fuel costs compared to 2010 before the accident to make up for the missing power 295equipment facility and operational changes  editas the crisis unfolded the japanese government sent a request for robots developed by the u s military the robots went into the plants and took pictures to help assess the situation but they couldnt perform the full range of tasks usually carried out by human workers 296 the fukushima disaster illustrated that robots lacked sufficient dexterity and robustness to perform critical tasks in response to this shortcoming a series of competitions were hosted by darpa to accelerate the development of humanoid robots that could supplement relief efforts 297 298 eventually a wide variety of specially designed robots were employed leading to a robotics boom in the region 299 but as of early 2016 three of them had promptly become nonfunctional due to the intensity of the radioactivity one was destroyed within a day 300a number of nuclear reactor safety system lessons emerged from the incident the most obvious was that in tsunamiprone areas a power stations sea wall must be adequately tall and robust 6 at the onagawa nuclear power plant closer to the epicenter of 11 march earthquake and tsunami 301 the sea wall was 14 meters 46 ft tall and successfully withstood the tsunami preventing serious damage and radioactivity releases 302 303nuclear power station operators around the world began to install passive autocatalytic hydrogen recombiners pars which do not require electricity to operate 304 305 306 pars work much like the catalytic converter on the exhaust of a car to turn potentially explosive gases such as hydrogen into water had such devices been positioned at the top of fukushima is reactor and containment buildings where hydrogen gas collected the explosions would not have occurred and the releases of radioactive isotopes would arguably have been much less 30unpowered filtering systems on containment building vent lines known as filtered containment venting systems fcvs can safely catch radioactive materials and thereby allow reactor core depressurization with steam and hydrogen venting with minimal radioactivity emissions 30 307 filtration using an external water tank system is the most common established system in european countries with the water tank positioned outside the containment building 308 in october 2013 the owners of kashiwazakikariwa nuclear power station began installing wet filters and other safety systems with completion anticipated in 2014 309 310for generation ii reactors located in flood or tsunami prone areas a 3 day supply of backup batteries has become an informal industry standard 311 312 another change is to harden the location of backup diesel generator rooms with watertight blastresistant doors and heat sinks similar to those used by nuclear submarines 30 the oldest operating nuclear power station in the world beznau which has been operating since 1969 has a notstand hardened building designed to support all of its systems independently for 72 hours in the event of an earthquake or severe flooding this system was built prior to fukushima daiichi 313 314upon a station blackout similar to the one that occurred after fukushimas backup battery supply was exhausted 315 many constructed generation iii reactors adopt the principle of passive nuclear safety they take advantage of convection hot water tends to rise and gravity water tends to fall to ensure an adequate supply of cooling water to handle the decay heat without the use of pumps 316 317reactions  editjapan  editmain article japanese reaction to fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster japan towns villages and cities

politically powerful nuclear industry public anger emerged over an official campaign  citation needed  not in citation given to play down the scope of the accident and the potential health risks 322 323 324in many cases the japanese governments reaction was judged to be less than adequate by many in japan especially those who were living in the region decontamination equipment was slow to be made available and then slow to be utilized as late as june 2011 even rainfall continued to cause fear and uncertainty in eastern japan because of its possibility of washing radioactivity from the sky back to earth  citation neededto assuage fears the government enacted an order to decontaminate over a hundred areas with a level contamination greater than or equivalent to one millisievert  clarification needed of radiation this is a much lower threshold than is necessary for protecting health the government also sought to address the lack of education on the effects of radiation and the extent to which the average person was exposed 325previously a proponent of building more reactors kan took an increasingly antinuclear stance following the disaster in may 2011 he ordered the aging hamaoka nuclear power plant closed over earthquake and tsunami concerns and said he would freeze building plans in july 2011 kan said japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy 326 in october 2013 he said that if the worstcase scenario had been realized 50 million people within a 250kilometer 160 mi radius would have had to evacuate 327on 22 august 2011 a government spokesman mentioned the possibility that some areas around the plant could stay for some decades a forbidden zone according to yomiuri shimbun the japanese government was planning to buy some properties from civilians to store waste and materials that had become radioactive after the accidents 328 329 chiaki takahashi japans foreign minister criticized foreign media reports as excessive he added that he could understand the concerns of foreign countries over recent developments at the nuclear plant including the radioactive contamination of seawater 330due to frustration with tepco and the japanese government providing differing confusing and at times contradictory information on critical health issues 331 a citizens group called  safecast  recorded detailed radiation level data in japan 332 333 the japanese government does not consider nongovernment readings to be authentic the group uses offtheshelf geiger counter equipment a simple geiger counter is a contamination meter and not a dose rate meter the response differs too much between different radioisotopes to permit a simple gm tube for dose rate measurements when more than one radioisotope is present a thin metal shield is needed around a gm tube to provide energy compensation to enable it to be used for dose rate measurements for gamma emitters either an ionization chamber a gamma spectrometer or an energy compensated gm tube are required members of the air monitoring station facility at the department of nuclear engineering at the university of berkeley california have tested many environmental samples

organization and the preparatory commission for the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty organization 337in may 2011 uk chief inspector of nuclear installations mike weightman traveled to japan as the lead of an international atomic energy agency iaea expert mission the main finding of this mission as reported to the iaea ministerial conference that month was that risks associated with tsunamis in several sites in japan had been underestimated 338in september 2011 iaea director general yukiya amano said the japanese nuclear disaster caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power 339 340 following the disaster it was reported in the economist that the iaea halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035 341in the aftermath germany accelerated plans to close its nuclear power reactors and decided to phase the rest out by 2022 342 italy held a national referendum in which 94 percent voted against the governments plan to build new nuclear power plants 343 in france president hollande announced the intention of the government to reduce nuclear usage by one third so far however the government has only earmarked one power station for closure – the aging plant at fessenheim on the german border – which prompted some to question the governments commitment to hollandes promise industry minister arnaud montebourg is on record as saying that fessenheim will be the only nuclear power station to close on a visit to china in december 2014 he reassured his audience that nuclear energy was a sector of the future and would continue to contribute at least 50 of frances electricity output 344another member of hollandes socialist party the mp christian bataille says the plan to curb nuclear was hatched as a way of securing the backing of his green coalition partners in parliament 345nuclear power plans were not abandoned in malaysia the philippines kuwait and bahrain or radically changed as in taiwan china suspended its nuclear development program briefly but restarted it shortly afterwards the initial plan had been to increase the nuclear contribution from 2 to 4 percent of electricity by 2020 with an escalating program after that renewable energy supplies 17 percent of china’s electricity 16 of which is hydroelectricity china plans to triple its nuclear energy output to 2020 and triple it again

351investigations  editthree investigations into the fukushima disaster showed the manmade nature of the catastrophe and its roots in regulatory capture associated with a network of corruption collusion and nepotism 352 353 regulatory capture refers to the situation where regulators charged with promoting the public interest defer to the wishes and advance the agenda of the industry or sector they ostensibly regulate those with a vested interest in specific policy or regulatory outcomes lobby regulators and influence their choices and actions regulatory capture explains why some of the risks of operating nuclear power reactors in japan were systematically downplayed and mismanaged so as to compromise operational safety 353many reports say that the government shares blame with the regulatory agency for not heeding warnings and for not ensuring the independence of the oversight function 354 the new york times said that the japanese nuclear regulatory system sided with and promoted the nuclear industry because of amakudari descent from heaven in which senior regulators accepted high paying jobs at companies they once oversaw to protect their potential future position in the industry regulators sought to avoid taking positions that upset or embarrass the companies tepcos position as the largest electrical utility in japan made it the most desirable position for retiring regulators typically the most senior officials went to work at tepco while those of lower ranks ended up at smaller utilities 355in august 2011 several top energy officials were fired by the japanese government affected positions included the viceminister for economy trade and industry the head of the nuclear and industrial safety agency and the head of the agency for natural resources and energy 356in 2016 three former tepco executives chairman tsunehisa katsumata and two vice presidents were indicted for negligence resulting in death and injury 218 357 in june 2017 the first
