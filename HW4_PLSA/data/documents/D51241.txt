people could be accommidated i was suprised at the number of resturarants that could not handle a large group when i tried to find a location for a family dinner for 40 people look for a local ramada holiday inn or concert hall give them a call the older large hotel chains were designed to be the place to handle large crowdsmsbettyboop40 · 1 decade ago0 1 comment oh that is a tough spot to be in but just remember that the marriage is way more important than the wedding and what matters is your love for each other your immediate family and 5 closest friends will be sure to understand as long as you make it clear to them something like we were planning to have a small reception but with all these new changes we are all just going to meet at olive garden we are really bummed that we wont be able to pay for anyones meal but we just wanted to celebrate with you however we could because we love you so much i know that personally if one of my friends said this to me i would be deeply honored to know that my friendship meant more to them than appearing richer than they were anyone who answers that you cant do this and have to pay for everyone or somehow live beyond your means either doesnt understand responsible budgeting or doesnt understand friendship congratulations on your engagement and job opportunity best of luck in your new life saralena · 2 years ago0 0 comment i work for darden the parent company of the olive garden no they will not close down the restaurant for a reception most darden restaurants however do large orders for take out some deliver but they do not cook on your premises if this is just a fake wedding call the general manager and ask how they can help you they often love the publicity and marketing involved good luck momof4boys · 1 decade ago1 1 comment ive worked in chain restaurants before but not at olive garden i would say no they dont mainly bc chain restaurants dont have private rooms its not there demographic chain restaurants want you in and out in under an hour weddings are long affairs usually 56 hours in that time the guests are often served different courses by waitstaff a place like olive garden does not have the time to prepare a 4course meal for one wedding when they have 250 other hungry guests in the dining room and an hour wait at the door in addition the waitstaff at restaurants like that are not hired as banquet staff they are hired to wait a certain amount of assigned tables in the restaurant and not any preplanned parties also in my opinion i think it would be tacky to have your wedding at the olive garden or other chain type restaurant the food is often frozen and then cooked up the chefs arent really chefs they are just people who have been trained to prepare meals the olive garden way it would also be a bit cheap to have a reception catered by a chain establishment like your guests are only worth a 1099 meal from the menu and a 199 fountain soda w obvious free refills answer girl 2007 · 1

for both lunch and dinner and are not going to shut down the entire resturant for a private party like thatwould loose way too much money however they may caterpspoptart · 1 decade ago0 1 comment for the best answers search on this site httpsshorturlimyjjgm aww i think they would understand completely and like you say your only inviting immediate family and close friends so im sure they would be happy to do this my only advice dont pick a restaurant that is really really expensive maybe you could let people know what your planning and see if they have any ideas on places that are nice and affordable good luck on your wedding day and i hope you get back on your feet soon  · 2 years ago0 0 comment no they dont hold wedding receptions my store has catered charity events on a few occasions
