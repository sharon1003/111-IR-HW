update all pdfs how fast is usain bolt no tags alignments to content standards 7 rp a3student view task jamaican sprinter usain bolt won the 100 meter sprint gold medal in the 2012 summer olympics he ran the 100 meter race in 963 seconds there are about 328 feet in a meter and 5280 feet in a mile what was usain bolts average speed for the 100 meter race in miles per hour im commentary this task involves a multistep conversion between two rates going from meters per second to miles per hour in this case the units coming from the 100 meter race are meters per second and we do not have a good intuition for what this means in miles per hour most of us are used to thinking about speeds in terms of miles per hour since the speedometers in our automobiles use these units so it is good for students to be able to convert between miles per hour and other units for speed that naturally come up the first solution shows all units in the calculations and does not make any calculations until the end the second solution goes step by step and provides an excellent opportunity to discuss rounding error as it is important here to make all calculations as in the first method before rounding rather than using the rounded numbers for successive calculations in addition to the work on conversion of units it might be interesting to compare the top speed of the fastest human being to some familiar animals animal top speed in mphhippopotamus 19kangaroo 45horse 47gazelle 50cheetah 70remarkably of the animals in the table the fastest human beings can only run faster than the hippopotamus note that the speed calculated in this problem is the average speed for 100 meters which is a little less than the top speed but 23mph is significantly less than any of the other animals on the list for a more creative implementation of this task the teacher could provide the table of different animal speeds and ask the students how the fastest human beings would fair against them in a race the relevant practice standards for this problem are mp2 reason abstractly and quantitatively as students move between the context and the calculations and mp6 attend to precision as students must focus on units and the accuracy with which they present their final answer note that both the time for the 100 meter race and the conversion from meters to feet are given with three digit so only three digits should remain in the answer also given the number of steps required to solve this problem it is well aligned to mp1 make sense of problems and persevere in solving them given the complexity of the problem it would not be appropriate for highstakes summative assessment but would be very appropriate in an instructional setting solutions solution 1 table we can make a table of distances and times and then find the corresponding rate at the end in this solution each successive line in the table represents a single unit conversion either for distance or for time the method used here first finds how many feet per second usain bolt is running and then moves from here to miles per hour usain bolt traveled 100 meters in 963 seconds 1 meter is 328 feet so 100 meters is feet usain bolt traveled 328 feet in 963 seconds this means he traveled 1 foot in seconds usain bolt traveled 1 foot in 002936 seconds 1 mile is 5280 feet so at this speed he would travel 1 mile in seconds at this speed usain bolt would travel 1 mile in 155 seconds 1 hour is seconds so he traveled 1 mile in hours at this speed usain bolt would travel 1 mile in 0043056 hours this means he would travel miles in 1 hour at this speed usain bolt would travel 232 miles in 1 hour we can summarize these steps in a table distance travelled time100 meters 963 seconds328 feet 963 seconds1 foot 029 seconds1 mile 155 seconds1 mile 0043 hours232 miles 1 hour the last line in the table tells shows that usain bolt is running a little over 23 miles per hour in this table the measurements of 963 seconds and 100 meters are not exact the other measurement in these calculations which is not exact is the 328 feet per meters in a situation like this all further numbers need to be appropriately rounded the rounding must come at the end however after making all calculations for example the 029 seconds to run a foot is a rounded number so in the next step when this is used to find how long it would take usain bolt to run one mile the calculation needs to be done not with 029 seconds but with 963 328 seconds solution 2 unit conversions we are given that usain bolt ran 100 meters in 963 seconds we first determine how many meters per second this is next we use the fact that there are about 328 meters per foot to convert the speed to feet per second next we convert feet to miles there are 5280 feet in a mile so this gives finally there are 60 seconds per minute and 60 minutes per hour so this is seconds per hour using this we can now convert our original information in terms of meters per second to miles per hour using a calculator we find that usain bolts average speed over the 100 meter race was about 232 miles per hour note that some of the numbers in this calculation namely 100 3600 and 5280 are exact while 328 and 963 are only approximate since the approximate numbers only have 3 significant digits we only report three digits in the final answer
