state flower while a banner below reads spirit of courage2 alaska released in 2008 alaskas quarter was the secondtolast to debut the image is of a grizzly bear with a salmon in its mouth a fitting symbol considering that over 98 of the grizzly population in the country lives in alaska the inscription reads the great land which beat out other possibilities like the last frontier north to the

effort captain joseph wadsworth squirreled the document away and hid it in the unusually large white oak which quickly became famous for its role in american independence the famous tree which fell

oak which is the state tree and you can read the state motto wisdom justice moderation on the surrounding banner the shape of the states outline has come under some criticism for apparently excluding one of georgias counties dade county is located in that most northwestern corner of the state where it looks like a chip has fallen off in the quarter design some people go so far as to say that the absence is an intentional exclusion as a form of delayed revenge for dades attempt to secede from the state prior to the civil war11 hawaii the final coin in the commemorative series is the only one to feature royalty along with the eight major islands and the states motto—written in hawaiian meaning the life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness—is king kamehameha i who is renowned for

county in this case15 iowa the design of the iowa quarter the 29th in the series comes directly from a painting by grant wood he of american gothic fame the iowa native became famous for his smalltown scenes and the one chosen for this quarter has a specific focus on education along with woods name the inscription reads foundations in education and shows a oneroom schoolhouse with a teacher and her

for mississippis quarter the 20th in the series bore the inscription the magnolia state the image that was ultimately selected features a closeup of two of the state flowers critics of the coin have said that while nice in theory this design ends up looking like an amorphous blob when produced quartersized25 missouri the 24th quarter to be released came with a lot more controversy than any of those preceding it the final design depicts the historic return of lewis and clarks expedition down the missouri river with the gateway arch rising behind them symbolically since construction on the arch didnt begin until more than a century after lewis and clarks exploration its a nice image but the man who designed it despises it missouri artist paul jackson was named the winner of the statewide contest after his submission was chosen but when he saw the mints finished design he didnt recognize it as his own the engravers at the mint it seems are not looking for an exact image but rather an idea what they produced doesnt look like jacksons original design so he took his protest all the way to washington d c where he rolled a fourfoot quarter down the street demanding justice he argued that the engravers were looking to have their names and initials immortalized along with the finished product not those of the citizens whose submissions were selected the mint claimed the conditions of such design contests never promised faithfulness to the winning submissions but following  quartergate  the term design contest was dropped from solicitations for ideas for later state quarters26 montana montanas quarter features a mountain range flattening into a vast plain across the diameter of the coin as reference to the varied and valuable topography of the state the caption

dakota quarter number 40 features south dakotas most recognizable landmark mount rushmore in addition to the fourheaded rock portrait the coin design includes wheat stalks and a chinese ringnecked pheasant although these are all fitting symbols critics have pointed out that in a state that boasts a high population of native americans the commemorative quarter features icons that are all in some way invasive mount rushmore has attracted controversy for serving as a visual reminder of how the mountains and the surrounding lands were violently seized from the lakota tribe who have historically protested the sculpture and both pheasants and wheat are exotic in south dakota where they have pushed out native species42 tennessee the three stars on tennessees quarter refer not to its numerical place in the nations formation—which is 16th—but rather the three regions of the state that have each made a unique contribution to the countrys musical heritage along with an open book of sheet music
