batteries lithium batteries are primary batteries that have lithium as an anode these types of batteries are also referred to as lithiummetal batteries they stand apart from other batteries in their high charge density long life and high cost per unit depending on the design and chemical compounds used lithium cells can produce voltages from 15 v comparable to a zinc–carbon or alkaline battery to about 37 v disposable primary lithium batteries must be distinguished from secondary lithiumion and lithiumpolymer 1 which are rechargeable batteries lithium is especially useful because its ions can be arranged to move between the anode and the cathode using an intercalated lithium compound as the cathode material but without using lithium metal as the anode material pure lithium will instantly react with water or even moisture in the air the lithium in lithium ion batteries is in a less reactive compound mistreatment during charging or discharging can cause outgassing of some of their contents which can cause explosions or fire lithium batteries are widely used in portable consumer electronic devices and in electric vehicles ranging from full sized vehicles to radio controlled toys

commercial implementation is available as of 2012 due to difficulties in achieving multiple discharge cycles without losing capacity 25 there are multiple possible implementations each having different energy capacities advantages and disadvantages in november 2015 a team of university of cambridge researchers furthered work on lithiumair batteries by developing a charging process capable of prolonging the battery life and battery efficiency their work resulted in a battery that delivered high energy densities more than 90 efficiency and could be recharged for up to 2000 times the lithiumair batteries are described as the ultimate batteries because they propose a high theoretical energy density of up to ten times the energy offered by regular lithiumion batteries they were first developed in a research environment by abraham  jiang in 1996 26 the technology however as of november 2015 will not be immediately available in any industry and it could take up to 10 years for lithiumair batteries to equip devices 27 the immediate challenge facing scientists involved in its invention is that the battery needs a special porous graphene electrode among other chemical components and a narrow voltage gap between charge and discharge to significantly increase efficiency the liquid organic electrolyte is a solution of an ionforming inorganic lithium compound in a mixture of a high permittivity solvent  propylene carbonate and a low viscosity solvent  dimethoxyethane  engineers at the university of california san diego have developed a breakthrough in electrolyte chemistry that enables lithium batteries to run at temperatures as low as 60 degrees celsius with excellent performance the new electrolytes also enable electrochemical capacitors to run as low as 80 degrees celsius — their current lowtemperature limit is 40 degrees celsius while the technology enables extreme lowtemperature operation high performance at room temperature is still maintained the new electrolyte chemistry could also increase the energy density and improve the safety of lithium batteries and electrochemical capacitors 28applications  editlithium batteries find application in many longlife critical devices such as pacemakers and other implantable electronic medical devices these devices use specialized lithiumiodide batteries designed to last 15 or more years but for other less critical applications such as in toys the lithium battery may actually outlast the device in such cases an expensive lithium battery may not be costeffective lithium batteries can be used in place of ordinary alkaline cells in many devices such as clocks and cameras although they are more costly lithium cells will provide much longer life thereby minimizing battery replacement however attention must be given to the higher voltage developed by the lithium cells before using them as a dropin replacement in devices that normally use ordinary zinc cells lithium batteries also prove valuable in oceanographic applications while lithium battery packs are considerably more expensive than standard oceanographic packs they hold up to three times the capacity of alkaline packs the high cost of servicing remote oceanographic instrumentation usually by ships often justifies this higher cost sizes and formats  editsee also button cell battery nomenclature and list of battery sizes small lithium batteries are very commonly used in small portable electronic devices such as pdas watches camcorders digital cameras thermometers calculators personal computer bios firmware 29 communication equipment and remote car locks they are available in many shapes and sizes with a common variety being the 3 volt coin type manganese variety typically 20 mm in diameter and 16–4 mm thick the heavy electrical demands of many of these devices make lithium batteries a particularly attractive option in particular lithium batteries can easily support the brief heavy current demands of devices such as digital cameras and they maintain a higher voltage for a longer period than alkaline cells popularity  editlithium primary batteries account for 28 of all primary battery sales in japan but only 1 of all battery sales in switzerland in the eu only 05 of all battery sales including secondary types are lithium primaries 30 31 32 33safety issues and regulation  editthe computer industrys drive to increase battery capacity can test the limits of sensitive components such as the membrane separator a polyethylene or polypropylene film that is only 2025 µm thick the energy density of lithium batteries has more than doubled since they were introduced in 1991 when the battery is made to contain more material the separator can undergo stress rapiddischarge problems  editlithium batteries can provide extremely high currents and can discharge very rapidly when shortcircuited although this is useful in applications where high currents are required a toorapid discharge of a lithium battery can result in overheating of the battery rupture and even an explosion lithiumthionyl chloride batteries are particularly susceptible to this type of discharge consumer batteries usually incorporate overcurrent or thermal protection or vents to prevent an explosion air travel  editfrom january 1 2013 much stricter regulations were introduced by iata regarding the carriage of lithium batteries by air they were adopted by the international postal union however some countries eg the uk have decided that they will not accept lithium batteries unless they are included with the equipment they power because of the above risks shipping and carriage of lithium batteries is restricted in some situations particularly transport of lithium batteries by air the united states transportation security administration announced restrictions effective january 1 2008 on lithium batteries in checked and carryon luggage the rules forbid lithium batteries not installed in a device from checked luggage and restrict them in carryon luggage by total lithium content 34australia post prohibited transport of lithium batteries in air mail during 2010 35uk regulations for the transport of lithium batteries were amended by the national chemical emergency centre in 2009 36in late 2009 at least some postal administrations restricted airmail shipping including express mail service of lithium batteries lithiumion batteries and products containing these such as laptops and cell phones among these countries are hong kong united states and japan 37 38 39methamphetamine labs  editunused lithium batteries provide a convenient source of lithium metal for use as a reducing agent in methamphetamine labs some jurisdictions have passed laws to restrict lithium battery sales or asked businesses to make voluntary restrictions in an attempt to help curb the creation of illegal meth labs in 2004 walmart stores were reported to limit the sale of disposable lithium batteries to three packages in missouri and four packages in other states 40health issues on ingestion  editbutton cell batteries are attractive to small children and often ingested in the past 20 years although there has not been an increase in the total number of button cell batteries ingested in a year researchers have noted a 67fold increase in the risk that an ingestion would result in a moderate or major complication 41the primary mechanism of injury with button battery ingestions is the generation of hydroxide ions which cause severe chemical burns at the anode this is an electrochemical effect of the intact battery and does not require the casing to be breached or the contents released complications include oesophageal strictures tracheooesophageal fistulas vocal cord paralysis aortooesophageal fistulas and death 42 the majority of ingestions are not witnessed presentations are nonspecific battery voltage has increased the 20 to 25 mm button battery size

from button battery ingestions by children of less than 4 years of age 43 button batteries can also cause significant necrotic injury when stuck in the nose or ears 44disposal  editregulations for disposal and recycling of batteries vary widely local governments may have additional requirements over those of national regulations in the united states one manufacturer of lithium iron disulfide primary batteries advises that consumer quantities of used cells may be discarded in municipal waste as the battery does not contain any substances controlled by us federal regulations 45 another manufacturer states that button size lithium batteries contain perchlorate which is regulated as a hazardous waste in california regulated quantities would not be found in typical consumer use of these cells 46as lithium in used but non working ie extended storage button cells is still likely to be in the cathode cup it is possible to extract commercially useful quantities of the metal from such cells as well as the manganese dioxide and specialist plastics from experiment the usual failure mode is that they will read 32v or above but be unable to generate useful current 5m a versus 40m
