home  writing resources  strategies for essay writing ending the essay conclusions so much is at stake in writing a conclusion this is after all your last chance to persuade your readers to your point of view to impress yourself upon them as a writer and thinker and the impression you create in your conclusion will shape the impression that stays with your readers after theyve finished the essay the end of an essay should therefore convey a sense of completeness and closure as well as a sense of the lingering possibilities of the topic its larger meaning its implications the final paragraph should close the discussion without closing it off to establish a sense of closure you might do one or more of the following conclude by linking the last paragraph to the first perhaps by reiterating a word or phrase you used at the beginning conclude with a sentence composed mainly of onesyllable words simple language can help create an effect of understated drama conclude with a sentence thats compound or parallel in structure such sentences can establish a sense of balance or order that may feel just right at the end of a complex discussion to close the discussion without closing it off you might do one or more of the following conclude with a quotation from or reference to a primary or secondary source one that amplifies your main point or puts it in a different perspective a quotation from say the novel or poem youre writing about can add texture and specificity to your discussion a critic or scholar can help confirm or complicate your final point for example you might conclude an essay on the idea of home in james joyces short story collection dubliners with information about joyces own complex feelings towards dublin his home or you might end with a biographers statement about joyces attitude toward dublin which could illuminate his characters responses to the city just be cautious especially about using secondary material make sure that you get the last word conclude by setting your discussion into a different perhaps larger context for example you might end an essay on nineteenthcentury muckraking journalism by linking it to a current news magazine program like 60 minutes conclude by redefining one of the key terms of your argument for example an essay on marxs treatment of the conflict between wage labor and capital might begin with marxs claim that the capitalist economy is    a gigantic enterprise of dehumanization  the essay might end by suggesting that marxist analysis is itself dehumanizing because it construes everything in economic  rather than moral or ethical terms conclude by considering the implications of your argument or analysis or discussion what does your argument imply or involve or suggest for example an essay on the novel ambiguous adventure by the senegalese writer cheikh hamidou kane might open with the idea that the protagonists development suggests kanes belief in the need to integrate western materialism and sufi spirituality in modern senegal the conclusion might make the new but related point that the novel on the whole suggests that such an integration is or isnt possible finally some advice on how not to end an essay dont simply summarize your essay a brief summary of your argument may be useful especially if your essay is longmore than ten pages or so but shorter essays tend not to require a restatement of your main ideas avoid phrases like in conclusion to conclude in summary and to sum up these phrases can be usefuleven welcomein oral presentations but readers can see by the telltale compression of the pages when an essay is about to end youll irritate your audience if you belabor the obvious resist the urge to apologize if youve immersed yourself in your subject you now know a good deal more about it than you can possibly include in a five or ten or 20page essay as a result by the time youve finished writing you may be having some doubts about what youve produced and if you havent immersed yourself in your subject you may be feeling even more doubtful about your essay as you approach the conclusion repress those doubts dont undercut your authority by saying things like this is just one approach to the subject there may be other better approaches   copyright 1998 pat bellanca for the writing center at harvard university
