apr062017view pdfreport number noar17007 type audit reports category facilities 23 comments background the u s postal service considers mail to be delayed when it is not processed in time to meet its established delivery day delayed mail can adversely affect postal service customers and harm the organization’s brand we used our risk model to identify processing facilities with high volumes of delayed mail from april to september 2016 delayed mail volume at the santa clarita ca processing and distribution center pdc increased by more than 34 million pieces or 264 percent compared to the same period last year while national delayed mail volume decreased by 75 percent the santa clarita pdc is responsible for the postal automated redirection system pars mail for southern california pars is an automated process that redirects mail because of insufficient postage a change of address or because the mail cannot be delivered due to an incomplete or incorrect address of the 47 million delayed mailpieces at the santa clarita pdc from april to september 2016 27 million were pars mail 19 million were letters and flats and 839000 were packages our objective was to determine the cause of delayed mail at the santa clarita pdc what the oig found pars and letter mail was delayed because the santa clarita pdc did not have enough staff to operate mail processing machines and delivery unit employees did not follow pars mail preparation procedures additionally we found that packages were delayed or sent to another facility for processing because of insufficient machine processing capacity in january 2016 pars mail processing operations moved from the industry ca pdc to the santa clarita pdc with 24 fulltime equivalent fte positions instead of the requested 64 fte positions or 63 percent fewer management said they were in the process of filling the open pars positions during our site visit in october 2016 we observed that because of insufficient staff up to 12 employees on each shift routinely split their workhours between operating pars mail processing machines and working in another mail processing operation this caused the pars machines to be idle for a portion of these shifts furthermore employees at the almost 300 delivery units served by the santa clarita pdc did not always follow pars mail preparation procedures when sending mail to the pdc for example they did not properly label trays containing pars mail or correctly identify pars mail trays by category as a result pdc personnel had to manually sort pars mail so it could be processed for delivery during our site visit there was a processing backlog of up to 4 days with an average of about 995000 pieces of parsdelayed mail per day we discussed the backlog and the incorrect pars mail preparation with pdc management management subsequently took corrective action to ensure the delivery units used the pars mail preparation procedures before sending the mail to the pdc the santa clarita pdc did not have sufficient machine capacity for packages management said the pdc operated the package processing machines for more hours than planned to ensure mail scheduled for delivery the next day was processed as a result there was not enough time to complete scheduled preventive maintenance in addition we observed the santa clarita pdc sending up to four trailers of packages a day to the los angeles international service center for processing management said the pdc is supposed to receive an additional package processing machine once they move pars operations to the pasadena pdc in march 2017 we did not assess these changes and plan to evaluate them in future audit work pars mail preparation and staffing issues and the insufficient machine capacity for packages from april to september 2016 resulted in about 29000 more overtime hours than budgeted at a cost of over 1 million management said they used the additional overtime workhours to keep staff after their shifts to process pars mail and sort packages when mail processing facilities do not have sufficient staffing and machine capacity and delivery unit employees do not follow established procedures there is an increased risk of delayed mail and overtime in addition to the added costs of overtime delayed mail could cause customers to move to alternative service providers which would reduce revenue what the oig recommended we recommended that postal service management ensure an adequate balance of pars mail workload and staff to prevent delayed mail and overtime we also recommended management ensure delivery units comply with pars mail preparation procedures finally we recommended that management develop a 25 year package processing plan to ensure processing capacity and staffing are adequate to support current and future package volume growth in the interim continue to redirect packages to facilities with excess processing capacity where possible and ensure preventive maintenance is performed within established parameters read full report comments 23susan parker i mailed a box of books to a store on jan 26th from sherman oaks post office the box was never scanned in santa clarita it has also

wednesday 5317 my package was not delivered 5317 i should get my money back for such poor customer service it took 33 hours for my package to go 70 miles from my house to san francisco that is absolutely ridiculous you should be ashamed of yourselves may 03 2017liam john mooneyinquiry delayed mail parcels thank you may 03 2017padraic coughlin over 87 people have recently reported theft or tampering of packages at the bulk sorting facility in springfield ma googles online reviews system shows rampant reports of packages being sliced open  valuables extracted and replaced with garbage or junk  and reinserted into the mail stream packages go off the radar permanently and it is evident to anyone capable of a google search that there is a theft ring operating within this facility dozens have reported yet nothing is done it is ironic that the usps pretends to care by publishing articles like this citing technical innovations and the like when in reality they have a major den of thieves openly stealing mail at a major east coast hub and the reviews show that complainants are routinely hungup on ridiculed etc my father worked 25 years as a letter carrier but usps is no longer a reputable organization apr 18 2017postal customer maybe you should look at the facilities in prescott valley az i had a package that amazon showed as delivered and left in a parcel locker at 456 pm yesterday 4132017 when it was in actuality not put into a parcel locker until 1400 today 4142017 even the tracking on uspscom showed the same info as amazon i went to pick up the package last night but there was none i have insider information that they scan packages as delivered so people will look like they are doing their jobs when in actuality they are not this happens a lot dont even bother complaining to a manager or a supervisor they avoid conflict like the plagueapr 14 2017fred muncy they still dont know whare my package isit ben lost  for three weeks or so i wish they would just ship it back to me please apr 12 2017tom henrichs nationally delayed mail has decreased by 75 that is good news so how come this is the first i a usps employee am hearing of it anecdotal good news is nice but carries little weight it is good to share news of substance with employees apr 11 2017sandi not sure why this a surprise everywhere in the po is understaffed working the staff 67 days a week 1012 hrs a day is the norm in baltimore never take into account vacations or illness pses and cca are treated terrible as long as mangament can say the mail is delivered apr 11 2017megan when is my package kay jewilers come apr 11 2017ronnie mc cabe the michigan metroplex pdc is worse management covers up their tracks to make them look good especially when it comes to filling out reports to their bosses and on telecons delayed mail constantly 1st class and standard and they hide mail in semi trailers especially when the pmg was there in august of 2016 please take a look this poor performance of the plant makes it harder on the aos because of all the working mail that comes late or getting circulars that were suppose to be delivered by a specific date but come days later because the plant didnt process this is especially true in regards to mount clemens mi main and annex post office apr 10 2017anonymous you should resign your position within the service and find a job that you can me proud of you a post employee that is instructed to perform your job you are being paid to perform and seem like a disengaged employees that should have been terminated years ago may 05 2017
