foundries accept for the manufacture of asicsvlsis mainly standard cells alike gerber gdsii contains masks layers as many as 24 to 30 including metal top layer s the term rtltogdsii refers to a design methodoly where already in the rtl stage route problems critical placements signal integristy crosstalk and other drcs are taken under account to shorten up the timing closure cycle process this is especially true for the new nanometer technologies below 013um this is a very short nutshell hope this helps1 members found this post helpful19th march 2003 1422 3cent junior member level 2join date

hierarchical processing applications were handicapped at output time with the new format the differences in data handling efficiency of hierarchical eda application software will become even more obvious mentor graphics corporation plans to support the gdsii replacement format in the mentor graphics® calibre® product family and the ic station® tool suite in commercial release as soon as the first quarter of 2003 testing shows up to 1050 times reductions in hierarchical data volume from gdsii and up to two or more times reduction in flat data volume from mebes mode5 format mentor agreed

because it uses internally defined formats for its data types the pattern data is considered to be contained in a library of cells cells may contain geometrical objects such as polygons boundaries paths and other cells objects in the cell are assigned to layers of the design different layers typically represent different processing steps for exposure on separate mask plates geometrical objects may also be tagged with datatypes which can be used for any purpose but are most commonly used to group together similarly sized objects for compensation of the proximity effect limits the gdsii format specification limits the number of vertices per polygon boundary and wire path to not more than 200 pairs of coordinates however many packages including link cad can read up to the technical maximum of 32766 coordinate pairs by default when exporting to gdsii link cad will not write more than 200 vertices and larger polygons and wires are split into fragments you may remove this limitation in the gdsii export options u can visit httpwwwlinkcadansyscom best regards wilson29th may 2003 070530th may 2003 0145 9chenycs member level 1join date apr 2001posts 33helped 0  0points

contains a hiearchy of structures each structure containing elements boundarypolygon pathpolyline textbox structure references structure array references the elements are situated on layers it is a binary format that is platform independent because it uses internally defined formats for its data types while reading gdsii files the gdsii internal data types like reals integers etc need to be converted to the platformcae package datatypes that are used the gdsii format is a sequential list of records each record contains a header to tell what information is in the record the order of the record needs to be according to the gdsii bnf because of this strict organization it is relativly easy to parse the maximum number of vertixes is officially only 200 xy pairs but many packages can read up to the absolute maximum of 64k232k simple because this is the maximum record lenght that can be specified two bytes the format is hard to read since it is binary for that viewers are available to view boolean the contents as ascii also an ascii format has been developed key format which is more than just a text representation it is possible to convert gdsiiformat to keyformat and back
