pegan by encouraging people to stick with plantbased foods and limit sugar theres no doubt that the pegan diet is good for your health sticking to this hybrid plan has the potential to provide benefits such as lower cholesterol and a decreased risk of diabetes dr cederquist says yet if weight loss is your main goal you might want to seek out a plan featuring more protein cederquist says the nutritional balance i have found to be most effective for weight loss is a reduced calorie diet with 35 to 40 percent of the calories coming from protein she points out that protein is essential in helping to maintain lean muscle mass which is instrumental in helping to burn excess calories and fat without enough protein your body will lose muscle mass and in turn be less effective at losing weight dr cederquist says that being said peganism is a very viable way to eat basically it sounds very healthy and eliminates a lot of problem foods saltz says the only tenement of peganism she disagrees with is the idea of limiting beans beans are extremely healthy oneingredient foods high in fiber and an inexpensive protein source saltz who teaches healthy cooking classes in los angeles
