extinct synonyms pleurotremata sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head modern sharks are classified within the clade selachimorpha or selachii and are the sister group to the rays however the term shark has also been used for extinct members of the subclass elasmobranchii outside the selachimorpha such as cladoselache and xenacanthus as well as other chondrichthyes such as the holocephalid eugenedontidans under this broader definition the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago 1 acanthodians are often referred to as spiny sharks though they are not part of chondrichthyes proper they are a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole since then sharks have diversified into over 500 species they range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark  etmopterus perryi  a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres 67 in in length to the whale shark  rhincodon typus  the largest fish in the world which reaches approximately 12 metres 40 ft in length sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2000 metres 6600 ft they generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions such as the bull shark and the river shark which can survive and be found in both seawater and freshwater 2 sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics they have numerous sets of replaceable teeth 3wellknown species such as the great white shark tiger shark blue shark mako shark thresher shark and hammerhead shark are apex predators —organisms at the top of their underwater

century 4 sharks were known to mariners as sea dogs 5 this is still evidential in several species termed  dogfish  or the porbeagle the etymology of the word shark is uncertain the most likely etymology states that the original sense of the word was that of predator one who preys on others from the dutch schurk meaning villain scoundrel cf card shark loan shark etc  which was later applied to the fish due to its predatory behaviour 6a now disproven theory is that it derives from the yucatec maya word xok pronounced shok 7 evidence for this etymology came from the oxford english dictionary which notes shark first came into use after sir john hawkins  sailors exhibited one in london in 1569 and posted  sharke  to refer to the large sharks of the caribbean sea however the middle english dictionary records an isolated occurrence of the word shark referring to a sea fish in a letter written by thomas beckington in 1442 which rules out a new world etymology 8evolution a collection of cretaceous shark teeth see also evolution of fish evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the ordovician period 450–420 million years ago before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents 1 only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans 9 the oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago in the silurian period 9 the first sharks looked very different from modern sharks 10 at this time the most common shark tooth is the cladodont a style of thin tooth with three tines like a trident apparently to help catch fish the majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago 11 most fossils are of teeth often in large numbers partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime which explains the abundant fossils the teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate an apatite when a shark dies the decomposing skeleton breaks up scattering the apatite prisms preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments among the most ancient and primitive sharks is cladoselache from about 370 million years ago 10 which has been found within paleozoic strata in ohio kentucky and tennessee at that point in earths history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large shallow ocean which stretched across much of north america cladoselache was only about 1 metre 33 ft long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws 10 its teeth had several pointed cusps which wore down from use from the small number of teeth found together it is most likely that cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks its caudal fins had a similar shape to the great white sharks and the pelagic shortfin and longfin makos the presence of whole fish arranged tailfirst in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility most fossil sharks from about 300 to 150 million years ago can be assigned to one of two groups the xenacanthida was almost exclusive to freshwater environments 12 13 by the time this group became extinct about 220 million years ago they had spread worldwide the other group the hybodonts appeared about 320 million years ago and lived mostly in the oceans but also in freshwater  citation needed the results of a 2014 study of the gill structure of an unusually wellpreserved 325 million year old fossil suggested that sharks are not living fossils but rather have evolved more extensively than previously thought over the hundreds of millions of years they have been around 14megalodon top two estimated maximum and conservative sizes with the whale shark great white shark and a human for scale modern sharks began to appear about 100 million years ago 11 fossil mackerel shark teeth date to the early cretaceous one of the most recently evolved families is the hammerhead shark family sphyrnidae which emerged in the eocene 15 the oldest white shark teeth date from 60 to 66 million years ago around the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs in early white shark evolution there are at least two lineages one lineage is of white sharks with coarsely serrated teeth and it probably gave rise to the modern great white shark and another lineage is of white sharks with finely serrated teeth these sharks attained gigantic proportions and include the extinct megatoothed shark c megalodon like most extinct sharks c megalodon is also primarily known from its fossil teeth and vertebrae this giant shark reached a total length tl of more than 16 metres 52 ft 16 17 c megalodon may have approached a maxima of 203 metres 67 ft in total length and 103 metric tons 114 short tons in mass 18 paleontological evidence suggests that this shark was an active predator of large cetaceans 18taxonomy sharks belong to the superorder selachimorpha in the subclass elasmobranchii in the class chondrichthyes the elasmobranchii also include rays and skates the chondrichthyes also include chimaeras it was thought that the sharks form a polyphyletic group some sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks 19 but current molecular studies support monophyly of both groups of sharks and batoids 20 21the superorder selachimorpha is divided into galea or galeomorphii  and squalea or squalomorphii  the galeans are the heterodontiformes orectolobiformes lamniformes and carcharhiniformes lamnoids and carcharhinoids are usually placed in one clade but recent studies show the lamnoids and orectoloboids are a clade some scientists now think that heterodontoids may be squalean the squaleans are divided into hexanchiformes and squalomorpha the former includes cow shark and frilled shark though some authors propose both families to be moved to separate orders the squalomorpha contains the squaliformes and the hypnosqualea the hypnosqualea may be invalid it includes the squatiniformes and the pristorajea which may also be invalid but includes the pristiophoriformes and the batoidea 19 22there are more than 470 species of sharks split across thirteen orders including four orders of sharks that have gone extinct 22carcharhiniformes commonly known as ground sharks the order includes the blue tiger bull grey reef blacktip reef caribbean reef blacktail reef whitetip reef and oceanic whitetip sharks collectively called the requiem sharks along with the houndsharks catsharks and hammerhead sharks they are distinguished by an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack heterodontiformes they are generally referred to as the bullhead or horn sharks hexanchiformes examples from this group include the cow sharks and frilled sharks which somewhat resembles a marine snake lamniformes they are commonly known as the mackerel sharks they include the goblin shark basking shark megamouth shark the thresher sharks shortfin and longfin mako sharks and great white shark they are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction the lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon carcharodon megalodon orectolobiformes they are commonly referred to as the carpet sharks including zebra sharks nurse sharks wobbegongs and the whale shark pristiophoriformes these are the sawsharks with an elongated toothed snout that they use for slashing their prey squaliformes this group includes the dogfish sharks and roughsharks squatiniformes also known as angel sharks they are flattened sharks with a strong resemblance to stingrays and skates† cladoselachiformes† hybodontiformes† symmoriida† xenacanthida xenacantiformesanatomy general anatomical features of sharks main article shark anatomy teeth main article shark tooth the teeth of tiger sharks are oblique and serrated to saw through flesh shark teeth are embedded in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw and are constantly replaced throughout life multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt some sharks lose 30000 or more teeth in their lifetime the rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months in most species teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row which is observed in the cookiecutter shark 23tooth shape depends on the sharks diet those that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing those that feed on fish have needlelike teeth for gripping and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting the teeth of planktonfeeders such as the basking shark are small and nonfunctional 24skeleton shark skeletons are very different from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates sharks and other cartilaginous fish  skates and rays have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue cartilage is flexible and durable yet is about half the normal density of bone this reduces the skeletons weight saving energy 25 because sharks do not have rib cages they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land 26jaw jaws of sharks like those of rays and skates are not attached to the cranium the jaws surface in comparison to the sharks vertebrae and gill arches needs extra support due to its heavy exposure to physical stress and its need for strength it has a layer of tiny hexagonal plates called  tesserae  which are crystal blocks of calcium salts arranged as a mosaic 27 this gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae but the jaws of large specimens such as the bull shark tiger shark and the great white shark have two to three layers or more depending on body size the jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers 25 in the rostrum snout the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts fins fin skeletons are elongated and supported with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers 28 most sharks have eight fins sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in the tailfirst direction 26dermal denticles main article dermal denticle the dermal denticles of a lemon shark viewed through a scanning electron microscope unlike bony fish sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body this works as an outer skeleton providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy 29 their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming 30tails tails provide thrust making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species due to their evolution in separate environments sharks possess a heterocercal caudal fin in which the dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than the ventral portion this is because the sharks vertebral column extends into that dorsal portion providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment this allows more efficient locomotion among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish by contrast most bony fish possess a homocercal caudal fin 31tiger sharks have a large upper lobe which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed the tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet whereas the porbeagle shark which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fastswimming prey 32 other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly such as the thresher sharks usage of its powerful elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid physiology buoyancy unlike bony fish sharks do not have gasfilled swim bladders for buoyancy instead sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene and their cartilage which is about half the normal density of bone 29 their liver constitutes up to 30 of their total body mass 33 the livers effectiveness is limited so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs using it as a form of swim bladder bottomdwelling sharks like the nurse shark have negative buoyancy allowing them to rest on the ocean floor some sharks if inverted or stroked on the nose enter a natural state of tonic immobility researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely 34respiration like other fish sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills unlike other fish shark gill slits are not covered but lie in a row behind the head a modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom–dwelling sharks spiracles are reduced or missing in active pelagic sharks 24 while the shark is moving water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as ram ventilation while at rest most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water a small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest these species are obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species 35 36the respiration and circulation process begins when deoxygenated blood travels to the sharks twochambered heart here the shark pumps blood to its gills via the ventral aorta artery where it branches into afferent brachial arteries reoxygenation takes place in the gills and the reoxygenated blood flows into the efferent brachial arteries which come together to form the dorsal aorta the blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body the deoxygenated blood from the body then flows through the posterior cardinal veins and enters the posterior cardinal sinuses from there blood enters the heart ventricle and the cycle repeats 37thermoregulation most sharks are coldblooded or more precisely poikilothermic meaning that their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment members of the family lamnidae such as the shortfin mako shark and the great white shark are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water in these sharks a strip of aerobic red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile miraculous net the common thresher shark has a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature which is thought to have evolved independently  not in citation given 38osmoregulation in contrast to bony fish with the exception of the coelacanth 39 the blood and other tissue of sharks and chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea up to 25 40 and trimethylamine noxide tmao allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater this adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater and they are therefore confined to marine environments a few exceptions exist such as the bull shark which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea 33 when a shark dies the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia 41 42digestion digestion can take a long time the food moves from the mouth to a jshaped stomach where it is stored and initial digestion occurs 43 unwanted items may never get past the stomach and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth 44one of the biggest differences between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines this short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tubelike intestine the valve provides a long surface area requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca 43senses smell the shape of the hammerhead shark s head may enhance olfaction by spacing the nostrils further apart sharks have keen olfactory senses located in the short duct which is not fused unlike bony fish between the anterior and posterior nasal openings with some species able to detect as little as one part per million of blood in seawater 45sharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril 46 this is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound they are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species and as a result often linger near or in sewage outfalls some species such as nurse sharks have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey sight eye of a bigeyed sixgill shark  hexanchus nakamuraishark eyes are similar to the eyes of other vertebrates including similar lenses corneas and retinas though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment with the help of a tissue called tapetum lucidum this tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters the effectiveness of the tissue varies with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils like humans something no teleost fish can do sharks have eyelids but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes to protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes this membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked however some species including the great white shark  carcharodon carcharias  do not have this membrane but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey the importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated some believe that electro and chemoreception are more significant while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important presumably the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant the use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions the sharks field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time 47 a microspectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind the remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and seeing only in shades of grey and green are believed to be effectively colorblind the study indicates that an objects contrast against the background rather than colour may be more important for object detection 48 49 50hearing although it is hard to test the hearing of sharks they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can possibly hear prey from many miles away 51 a small opening on each side of their heads not the spiracle leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel the lateral line shows a similar arrangement and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores this is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration and sounddetecting organs that are grouped together as the acousticolateralis system in bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost electromagnetic field receptors ampullae of lorenzini and motion detecting canals in the head of a shark electroreception main article electroreception the ampullae of lorenzini are the electroreceptor organs they number in the hundreds to thousands sharks use the ampullae of lorenzini to detect the electromagnetic fields that all living things produce 52 this helps sharks particularly the hammerhead shark find prey the shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation 53lateral line main article lateral line this system is found in most fish including sharks it detects motion or vibrations in water the shark can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50 hz 54life history the claspers of male spotted wobbegong shark egg the spiral egg case of a port jackson shark shark lifespans vary by species most live 20 to 30 years the spiny dogfish has one of the longest lifespans at more than 100 years 55 whale sharks  rhincodon typus may also live over 100 years 56 earlier estimates suggested the greenland shark  somniosus microcephalus could reach about 200 years but a recent study found that a 502metrelong 165 ft specimen was 392 ± 120 years old ie at least 272 years old making it the longestlived vertebrate known 57 58reproduction unlike most bony fish sharks are kselected reproducers meaning that they produce a small number of welldeveloped young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle 59 sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish for example lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13–15 60sexual sharks practice internal fertilization 61 the posterior part of a male sharks pelvic fins are modified into a pair of intromittent organs called claspers analogous to a mammalian penis of which one is used to deliver sperm into the female 62mating has rarely been observed in sharks  citation needed the smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female in less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel to each other while the male inserts a clasper into the females oviduct females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating the bite marks may also come from courtship behavior the male may bite the female to show his interest in some species females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites 62asexual there have been a number of documented cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a pup on her own through parthenogenesis 63 64 the details of this process are not well understood but genetic fingerprinting showed that the pups had no paternal genetic contribution ruling out sperm storage the extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed scientists say that asexual reproduction in the wild is rare and probably a lastditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity which helps build defenses against threats to the species species that rely solely on it risk extinction asexual reproduction may have contributed to the blue shark s decline off the irish coast 65brooding sharks display three ways to bear their young varying by species oviparity viviparity and ovoviviparity 66 67ovoviviparity most sharks are ovoviviparous meaning that the eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mothers body and that the eggs yolk and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct nourishes the embryos the young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviducts fluids as in viviparity the young are born alive and fully functional lamniforme sharks practice oophagy where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs taking this a step further sand tiger shark pups cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos the survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood the young to a comparatively large size before birth the whale shark is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas including bays river mouths and shallow reefs they choose such areas for protection from predators mainly other sharks and the abundance of food dogfish have the longest known gestation period of any shark at 18 to 24 months basking sharks and frilled sharks appear to have even longer gestation periods but accurate data are lacking 66oviparity some species are oviparous laying their fertilized eggs in the water in most oviparous shark species an egg case with the consistency of leather protects the developing embryo s these cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection the egg case is commonly called a mermaids purse oviparous sharks include the horn shark catshark port jackson shark and swellshark 66 68viviparity viviparity is the gestation of young without the use of a traditional egg and results in live birth 69 viviparity is sharks can be placental or aplacental 69 young are born fully formed and selfsufficient 69 hammerheads the requiem sharks such as the bull and blue sharks  and smoothhounds are viviparous 59 66behavior the classic view describes a solitary hunter ranging the oceans in search of food however this applies to only a few species most live far more social sedentary benthic lives and appear likely to have their own distinct personalities 70 even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year 71 shark migration patterns may be even more complex than in birds with many sharks covering entire ocean basins sharks can be highly social remaining in large schools sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands eg in the gulf of california 33 crossspecies social hierarchies exist for example oceanic whitetip sharks dominate silky sharks of comparable size during feeding 59when approached too closely some sharks perform a threat display this usually consists of exaggerated swimming movements and can vary in intensity according to the threat level 72speed in general sharks swim cruise at an average speed of 8 kilometres per hour 50 mph but when feeding or attacking the average shark can reach speeds upwards of 19 kilometres per hour 12 mph the shortfin mako shark the fastest shark and one of the fastest fish can burst at speeds up to 50 kilometres per hour 31 mph 73 the great white shark is also capable of speed bursts these exceptions may be due to the warmblooded or homeothermic nature of these sharks physiology sharks can travel 70 to 80 km in a day 74intelligence sharks possess braintobody mass ratios that are similar to mammals and birds 75 and have exhibited apparent curiosity and behavior resembling play in the wild 76 77there is evidence that juvenile lemon sharks can use observational learning in their investigation of novel objects in their environment 78sleep all sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for them to breathe however not all species need to be moving to do this those that are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water it has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them 79 and as such they are not truly asleep species that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming in which the shark is essentially unconscious it is known from experiments conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord rather than its brain coordinates swimming so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping and this also may be the case in larger shark species 79ecology feeding this section is about shark feeding for the sport of shark feeding see shark baiting most sharks are carnivorous 80 basking sharks whale sharks and megamouth sharks have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton basking sharks practice ram feeding whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean this type of feeding requires gill rakers —long slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve —analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales the shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows from time to time in huge mouthfuls teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding 80unlike many other sharks the great white shark is not actually an apex predator in all of its natural environments as it is sometimes hunted by orcas other highly specialized feeders include cookiecutter sharks which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals cookiecutter teeth are enormous compared to the animals size the lower teeth are particularly sharp although they have never been observed feeding they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal twisting their bodies to rip off flesh 33some seabed–dwelling species are highly effective ambush predators angel sharks and wobbegongs use camouflage to lie in wait and suck prey into their mouths 81 many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth other sharks feed on squid or fish which they swallow whole the viper dogfish has teeth it can point outwards to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact the great white and other large predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their toothstudded rostra many sharks including the whitetip reef shark are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey these social sharks are often migratory traveling huge distances around ocean basins in large schools these migrations may be partly necessary to find new food sources 82range and habitat sharks are found in all seas they generally do not live in fresh water with a few exceptions such as the bull shark and the river shark which can swim both in seawater and freshwater 83 sharks are common down to depths of 2000 metres 7000 ft and some live even deeper but they are almost entirely absent below 3000 metres 10000 ft the deepest confirmed report of a shark is a portuguese dogfish at 3700 metres 12100 ft 84relationship with humans attacks a sign warning about the presence of sharks in salt rock south africa snorkeler swims near blacktip reef shark in rare circumstances involving poor visibility blacktips may bite a human mistaking it for prey under normal conditions they are harmless and shy main article shark attack in 2006 the international shark attack file isaf undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks the average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 43 85contrary to popular belief only a few sharks are dangerous to humans out of more than 470 species only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans the great white oceanic whitetip tiger and bull sharks 86 87 these sharks are large powerful predators and may sometimes attack and kill people despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage 88the perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks such as the jersey shore shark attacks of 1916 and through popular fictional works about shark attacks such as the jaws film series jaws author peter benchley as well as jaws director steven spielberg later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as maneating monsters 89to help avoid an unprovoked attack humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much 90in captivity main article sharks in captivity until recently only a few benthic species of shark such as hornsharks leopard sharks and catsharks had survived in aquarium conditions for a year or more this gave rise to the belief that sharks as well as being difficult to capture and transport were difficult to care for more knowledge has led to more species including the large pelagic sharks living far longer in captivity along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation 91 for a long time the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long but in september 2004 the monterey bay aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her a whale shark in georgia aquarium most species are not suitable for home aquaria and not every species sold by pet stores are appropriate some species can flourish in home saltwater aquaria 92 uninformed or unscrupulous dealers sometimes sell juvenile sharks like the nurse shark which upon reaching adulthood is far too large for typical home aquaria 92 public aquaria generally do not accept donated specimens that have outgrown their housing some owners have been tempted to release them 92 species appropriate to home aquaria represent considerable spatial and financial investments as they generally approach adult lengths of 3 feet 90 cm and can live up to 25 years 92in hawaii sharks figure prominently in hawaiian mythology stories tell of men with shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form a common theme was that a sharkman would warn beachgoers of sharks in the waters the beachgoers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the sharkman who warned them hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods among a fishing people the most popular of all aumakua or deified ancestor guardians are shark aumakua kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark the body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awestruck family to the markings on the sharks body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloveds body had been wrapped such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet receiving food and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies the ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery many native hawaiian families claim such an aumakua who is known by name to the whole community 93kamohoalii is the best known and revered of the shark gods he was the older and favored brother of pele 94 and helped and journeyed with her to hawaii he was able to assume all human and fish forms a summit cliff on the crater of kilauea is one of his most sacred spots at one point he had a heiau temple or shrine dedicated to him on every piece of land that jutted into the ocean on the island of molokai kamohoalii was an ancestral god not a human who became a shark and banned the eating of humans after eating one herself 95 96 in fijian mythology dakuwaqa was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls in popular culture main article sharks in popular culture in contrast to the complex portrayals by hawaiians and other pacific islanders the european and western view of sharks has historically been mostly of fear and malevolence 97 sharks are used in popular culture commonly as eating machines notably in the jaws novel and the film of the same name along with its sequels 98 sharks are threats in other films such as deep blue sea the reef and others although they are sometimes used for comedic effect such as in finding nemo and the austin powers series these comedic effects can sometimes be unintentional as seen in batman the movie and various syfy channel films like dinoshark and sharktopus sharks tend to be seen quite often in cartoons whenever a scene involves the ocean such examples include the tom and jerry cartoons jabberjaw and other shows produced by hannabarbera they also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters popular misconceptions a popular myth is that sharks are immune to disease and cancer but this is not scientifically supported sharks have been known to get cancer 99 100 both diseases and parasites affect sharks the evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few if any scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease 101 other apparently false claims are that fins prevent cancer 102 and treat osteoarthritis 103 no scientific proof supports these claims at least one study has shown shark cartilage of no value in cancer treatment 104conservation further information list of threatened sharks and shark sanctuary the value of shark fins for shark fin soup has led to an increase in shark catches usually only the fins are taken while the rest of the shark is discarded usually into the sea the annual shark catch has increased rapidly over the last 60 years a 14foot 43 m 1200pound 540 kg tiger shark caught in kāneohe bay oahu in 1966fishery it is estimated that 100 million sharks are killed by people every year due to commercial and recreational fishing 105 106 shark finning yields are estimated at 144 million metric tons for 2000 and 141 million tons for 2010 based on an analysis of average shark weights this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000 and about 97 million sharks in 2010 with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year 107 108 sharks are a common seafood in many places including japan and australia in the australian state of victoria shark is the most commonly used fish in fish and chips  citation needed in which fillets are battered and deepfried or crumbed and grilled in fish and chip shops shark is called flake in india small sharks or baby sharks called sora in tamil language telugu language are sold in local markets since the flesh is not developed cooking the flesh breaks it into powder which is then fried in oil and spices called sora puttusora poratu the soft bones can be easily chewed they are considered a delicacy in coastal tamil nadu icelanders ferment greenland sharks to produce a delicacy called hákarl 109 during a fouryear period from 1996 to 2000 an estimated 26 to 73 million sharks were killed and traded annually in commercial markets 110sharks are often killed for shark fin soup fishermen capture live sharks fin them and dump the finless animal back into the water shark finning involves removing the fin with a hot metal blade 106 the resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators 111 shark fin has become a major trade within black markets all over the world fins sell for about 300lb in 2009 112 poachers illegally fin millions each year few governments enforce laws that protect them 108 in 2010 hawaii became the first u s state to prohibit the possession sale trade or distribution of shark fins 113 from 1996 to 2000 an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins 110shark fin soup is a status symbol in asian countries and is considered healthy and full of nutrients sharks are also killed for meat european diners consume dogfishes smoothhounds catsharks makos porbeagle and also skates and rays 114 however the u s fda lists sharks as one of four fish with swordfish king mackerel and tilefish whose high mercury content is hazardous to children and pregnant women sharks generally reach sexual maturity only after many years and produce few offspring in comparison to other harvested fish harvesting sharks before they reproduce severely impacts future populations capture induced premature birth and abortion collectively called captureinduced parturition occurs frequently in sharksrays when fished 61 captureinduced parturition is rarely considered in fisheries management despite being shown to occur in at least 12 of live bearing sharks and rays 88 species to date 61the majority of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management the rise in demand for shark products increases pressure on fisheries 34 major declines in shark stocks have been recorded—some species have been depleted by over 90 over the past 20–30 years with population declines of 70 not unusual 115 a study by the international union for conservation of nature suggests that one quarter of all known species of sharks and rays are threatened by extinction and 25 species were classified as critically endangered 116 117shark culling a shark cull in western australia killed dozens of sharks in 2014 mostly tiger sharks 118 until it was cancelled after public protests and a decision by the western australia epa there is an ongoing imminent threat policy in western australia in which sharks that threat humans in the ocean can be shot and killed 119 this imminent threat policy has been criticized by senator rachel siewart for killing endangered sharks 120 from 1962 to the present 121 the government of queensland has targeted and killed sharks in large numbers by using drum lines under a shark control program—this program has also inadvertently killed large numbers of other animals such as dolphins 122 123 the government of new south wales also has a program that deliberately kills sharks using nets 124 kwazulunatal an area of south africa has a sharkkilling program using nets and drum lines—these nets and drum lines have killed turtles and dolphins and have been criticized for killing wildlife permanent or semipermanent deployment of sharkfishing gear off highuse beaches which includes shark nets and drum lines have been claimed to be successful in reducing the incidence of shark attack at the protected beaches 125 126 though this assertion has been disputed 127 128 killing sharks negatively affects the marine ecosystem 127 a nonlethal method of reducing shark attacks involves capturing sharks and moving them further offshore 129other threats other threats include habitat alteration damage and loss from coastal development pollution and the impact of fisheries on the seabed and prey species 130 the 2007 documentary sharkwater exposed how sharks are being hunted to extinction 131protection in 1991 south africa was the first country in the world to declare great white sharks a legally protected species 132intending to ban the practice of shark finning while at sea the united states congress passed the shark finning prohibition act in 2000 133 two years later the act saw its first legal challenge in united states v approximately 64695 pounds of shark fins in 2008 a federal appeals court ruled that a loophole in the law allowed nonfishing vessels to purchase shark fins from fishing vessels while on the high seas 134 seeking to close the loophole the shark conservation act was passed by congress in december 2010 and it was signed into law in january 2011 135 136in 2003 the european union introduced a general shark finning ban for all vessels of all nationalities in union waters and for all vessels flying a flag of one of its member states 137 this prohibition was amended in june 2013 to close remaining loopholes 138in 2009 the international union for conservation of nature s iucn red list of endangered species named 64 species onethird of all oceanic shark species as being at risk of extinction due to fishing and shark finning 139 140in 2010 the convention on international trade in endangered species  cites rejected proposals from the united states and palau that would have required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of scalloped hammerhead oceanic whitetip and spiny dogfish sharks the majority but not the required twothirds of voting delegates approved the proposal china by far the worlds largest shark market and japan which battles all attempts to extend the convention to marine species led the opposition 141 142 in march 2013 three endangered commercially valuable sharks the hammerheads the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to appendix 2 of cites bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation 143in 2010 greenpeace international added the school shark shortfin mako shark mackerel shark tiger shark and spiny dogfish to its seafood red list a list of common supermarket fish that are often sourced from unsustainable fisheries 144 advocacy group shark trust campaigns to limit shark fishing advocacy group seafood watch directs american consumers to not eat sharks 145under the auspices of the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals cms also known as the bonn convention the memorandum of understanding on the conservation of migratory sharks was concluded and came into effect in march 2010 it was the first global instrument concluded under cms and aims at facilitating international coordination for the protection conservation and management of migratory sharks through multilateral intergovernmental discussion and scientific research in july 2013 new york state a major market and entry point for shark fins banned the shark fin trade joining seven other states of the united states and the three pacific u s territories in providing legal protection to sharks 146see also fish portal sharks portal list of sharks list of prehistoric cartilaginous fish genera osteichthyes marine vertebrate outline of sharks
