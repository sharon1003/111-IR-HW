how to maintain swimming pool water it’s all about the water in order to make your pool look inviting you need to keep the water crystal clear you do not have to be a chemist in order to maintain the water quality in your pool however you should understand the components that make your pool water safe and ideal for swimming the components are tested based on a parts per million ppm measurement this is the measurement of the parts of a substance in relation to one million parts by volume of pool water how to test swimming pool water using the test strips from the pool supply store should be sufficient for testing get the strips that show the chlorine alkaline p h and cyanuric acid find an area away from the skimmer and the returns and with the strip in hand submerse about 18 inches into the water for about 10 seconds remove but don’t shake water off wait a few moments until the colors fill in compare each component’s color reading to the color range on the product bottle read the instructions that were provided with the test kit as this procedure could vary from product to productp hthe p h balance of your water impacts the effectiveness of the chlorine in your water the idea test reading for p h is between 74 and 76 if the test reading is below 72 then the water is more on the acidic side a test reading above 78 indicates the water is more on the alkalinity side monitor the p h daily using test strips chlorine to keep bacterial pathogens and algae from growing in your water the chlorine sanitizer level needs to be at a safe level for swimming a chlorine test reading between 10 and 30 ppm is optimal if you use bromine tablets instead of chlorine as the sanitizer then the reading should be between 20 and 40 ppm ask your pool store for more advice on the pros and cons of using bromine instead of chlorine or if you want to switch over to bromine from chlorine or visa versa monitor the chlorine level daily using the test strips for more info on chlorine visit the acc american chemistry alkalinity the alkalinity reading should be between 100 and 120 ppm typically goes hand in hand with p h if the alkalinity reading is low then most likely the p h reading is low and visa versa typically chlorine shock contains alkaline which will help raise the alkaline level on the flip side of that chlorine tablets which contain cyanuric acid tends to lower the alkalinity cyanuric acid the cyanuric acid chlorine stabilizer reading should be between 20 and 30 ppm this component is usually a product of chlorine tablets it slows the escapeevaporation of chlorine which in turn helps to maintain a more consistent chlorine level however since chlorine tablets contain this component which is an acid it tends to lower the alkalinity and the p h safety considerations consideration to keep in mind when dealing with pool chemicals always follow the manufacturer’s instructions and warnings as indicated on the label don’t mix any chemicals together add each separately to the pool wear protective safety glasses and avoid breathing in vapors when applying store chemical in a cool dry and shaded area out of reach of children and family pets how to apply pool chemicals if your pool is sanitized using chlorine chemicals then the two primary applications you’ll want to use in your pool are chlorine shock i like the granular shock that is package in 1 pound bags and the chlorine tablets i prefer the 3 inch tablets that you add to the chlorinator if your pool is sanitized with a chlorine generator system that produces chlorine from salt added to the pool then you won’t need to add chlorine chemicals at all you just need to add salt occasionally to the pool and adjust the main control unit to increase the amount of chlorine release ask your pool installer or pool supply store for advice on this baking soda sodium bicarbonate is an idea ingredient for raising the alkalinity and the p h other products like p h increaser and alkaline increaser are available at the pool supply store adjusting pool water after pool opening when you first open your pool you should get the system running before adding the initial dose of sanitizer via chlorine shock however i f you have a chlorine generator you only need to add salt to the pool so you can skip to the the adjusting the p h and alkalinity section if applying chlorine shock then for example a 16’ by 32’ pool which is about 20000 gallons one pound of shock should raise the chlorine level to 2 ppm you should probably add 2 pounds to kill all the bacteria and get the level to 4 ppm after this you may need to add more if the chlorine level doesnt rise to the appropriate level i would not add any more shock for at least a day or two after the initial dose also wait about two days before adding the chlorine or bromine tablets to the chlorinator otherwise your chlorine level may be too high also do not add chlorine or bromine tablets to the skimmer basket doing so will reduce the life of the pool pump and filter getting the chlorine to the correct level after pool opening can be tricky applying granular shock to your pool granular shock should be mixed with water before adding to the pool otherwise it could reduce the life of your vinyl liner when mixing granular shock wear safety glasses and rubber gloves using a 5gallon bucket insert 1 pound of granular shock be careful not to inhale the vapors or dust add water to fill about ½ way with a hose be careful of splash back and stir very well with a wood stick pour the mixture slowly into the water on the pool steps if there are any granules left on the bottom of the bucket there usually is then add more water and stir and pour this in again as with all pool chemicals keep children and pets away from the bucket when mixing and keep everyone out of the pool when adding to the pool the best time to apply is in the evening because the chlorine won’t escapeevaporate sunlight causes this also you must keep everyone out of the pool for about 8 hours after shocking to allow time for the shock to circulate throughout the pool on a routine basis apply one pound of shock about every 10 days to keep the pool chlorine level active applying chlorine tablets chlorine tablets can be added to the chlorinator usually 2 or 3 at a time should last about a week before you need to add 2 or 3 more you can also put chlorine tablets in a floater basket but remove the floater basket before swimming do not put tablets in the skimmer basket when you open the chlorine tablet container avoid inhaling  keep children and pets away also after handling the tablets rinse your hands off in the pool water avoid touching your eyes adjusting the p h and alkalinity if the alkaline is low try add baking soda to the skimmer in the morning you could also add ‘alkaline increaser’ or ‘alkaline up’ if you don’t want to use baking soda keeping a p h reading around 74 and 76 is the best level for your swimming pool it is easiest on your eyes and the pool parts and equipment if it is lower than 70 then most likely the alkaline is also low adding baking soda or ‘alkaline up’ should raise the p h also if the p h is still low after a day or two then try adding p h increaser if the p h and alkaline are too high then the water tends to get cloudy and this condition could invite algae growth under these conditions i would get the ‘alkaline decreaser’ or the ‘p h decreaser’ from the pool supply store if the cyanuric acid is too high then i suggest backing off on the chlorine tablets since these contain cyanuric acid shock doesn’t have cyanuric acid and can be used temporarily until the cyanuric acid levels come down to normal if this is the case try adding 1 pound of shock using the mixing method in the bucket and apply to pool steps about every other 3 days for about 2 weeks then return to the tablets ask your pool supply store for more advice on this if the condition continues they may recommend draining a few inches of water from the top of the pool the cyanuric acid tends to hang on the top green water trouble shooting tips if you pool water turns green this could be caused by algae growth if the p h is too high or if the chlorine level is too low adding chlorine tablets sanitizer should alleviate this if the p h remains high then add ‘p h decreaser’ or ‘p h down’ and follow the instruction on how to apply if the p h is low and the chlorine is 30 ppm and the water remains green then this could be an indication that your water has a high copper level have your water tested at the pool supply store there are products at the pool supply store that can remedy this situation green water could also be an indication your filters are dirty or coated with tree pollen this usually happens a day or two after you add shock because it breaks down the yellowgreen pollen material collected on your filter that is eventually pushed back into pool to remedy this pull the filters and hose them off add baking soda and within a day or two the water should clear routine maintenance to keep pool water crystal clear on a daily basis remove any leaves and debris from the skimmer basket also check the pump trap basket to see if this has a lot of debris floating around occasionally empty this as well remove leaves and bugs that are floating on top of the water with your hand held leaf net or hand held pool skimmer also keep the filtering system clean backwash filters or remove filters from housing and hose off about every two weeks or so test the water with test strips to check the component levels make any necessary adjustments that are needed home pool opening routine maintenance trouble shooting pool closing
