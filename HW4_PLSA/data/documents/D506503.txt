is exilis better than a facelift exilis is a device that was introduced to dermatologists several years ago and is hyped by the manufacturer as a viable alternative to cosmetic surgery the creator of the device btl aesthetics created this device to use radiofrequency waves to heat up specific layers of the skin in order to melt away fat and tighten skin many dermatologists have quickly adopted the exilis technology to provide their patients with an alternative to liposuction and other surgery however before opting for this procedure it’s important to understand what exilis can and cannot do this is vital because the full course of treatments runs in the 1000 to 1500 range – depending on your geographical location and the prestige of your doctor – so you must have realistic expectations before spending money on treatment discover the best skin care products of 2017how exilis works exilis technology currently comes in two models the btl exilis elite a machine designed for body treatments and the btl exilis protégé a device for facial treatments the basic idea behind the technology has already been used in the field dermatology before and revolves around stimulating certain processes within the skin by using radio frequency waves by using different wave settings the energy can penetrate the skin and heat up some of the different layers for example exilis skin tightening works by stimulating collagen production within the skin the specific radio frequencies unravel the collagen fibers causing fibroblasts to start producing more of this protein this can have a skin tightening effect in the long term by building up the fiber network in the skin exilis is also used for the purposes of fat reduction by delivering the radiofrequency deeper into the tissues the exilis technology can “melt away” the fat the actual process works by using energy to destroy the fat cells which are then broken down and removed from the treatment area by the body’s natural processes does exilis hurt the exilis skin tightening and fat removal treatment was designed to be painless and comfortable there are no needles on injections involved and most patients tolerate the procedure very well without the need for any topical anesthetics at the heart of exilis’ design is a cooling technology that helps prevent damage to the upper layers of the skin it is this aspect of the technology that makes treatment painless and quite comfortable the cooling occurs simultaneously with the application of radio frequencies so that the skin is cooled at the same time as the frequencies pass through this is the key that allows for deep penetration and melting of fat cells beneath while keeping the skin layers intact customizability of treatment the combination of different radio frequencies and the cooling technology is further enhanced by giving your skin care professional a wide range of treatment intensity options this ability to select different settings is absolutely vital for creating a customizable exilis treatment why because the thickness of your skin varies depending on the part of the body that is being treated therefore the combination of radio frequency energy and cooling strength must be adjusted for optimal results for example if you’re getting exilis treatment on your thighs the radio frequency energy will need to be stronger as it will have to penetrate through thicker layers of skin to get to the fat deposits on the other hand if you are treating the face or even areas under the eyes the exilis cooling settings will have to be stronger while the radio frequency will have to be much weaker this is because facial skin is much thinner much more sensitive and is more easily damaged cost of exilis treatment before agreeing to exilis treatment it’s important to understand that you’ll need at least four treatment sessions to achieve visible results this is because the skin and the fat deposits can only sustain so much damage at once and need time to recover after each treatment therefore you must be able to pay for at least four treatments as getting only one or two may end up being a waste of money the total cost of four exilis treatments will fall somewhere in the 1000 – 1500 range depending on the area where you live and the reputation of your doctor is exilis comparable to liposuction exilis has been shown to provide strong visible results when administered properly and can significantly reduce fat deposits that have accumulated under the skin therefore it is commonly used to remove belly fat after pregnancy excess fat on the thighs and other parts of the body as well as jowls chin fat and fat on other parts of the face however although exilis can produce dramatic results it will never be as effective as cosmetic surgery for example it can certainly remove excess fat and tighten skin on the face but it will not show the same results as a facelift would further if you are struggling with excess abdominal fat and skin after childbirth and are looking at exilis as an alternative to a tummy tuck it’s important to understand that exilis will only target fat and skin cells a tummy tuck on the other hand also tightens the stretched abdominal muscles something that exilis cannot do exilis side effects exilis skin tightening and fat removal is not believed to have significant side effects most people will not see any redness or irritation and there should not be any bruising however if you opt for this procedure make sure to work with a reputable experienced doctor who understands this technology this is because the settings on the device must be attuned to the area of the skin that is being treated for example if you are treating areas around the eyes and your doctor uses exilis settings meant for the abdomen this could potentially cause skin damage because too much energy will be delivered to the treatment site the best skin care lines the absolute best skin care line of
