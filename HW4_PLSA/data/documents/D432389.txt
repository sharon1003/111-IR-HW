from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search this article is about general theory and electromagnetic phased array for the ultrasonic and medical imaging application see phased array ultrasonics for the optical application see phased array optics animation showing how a phased array works it consists of an array of antenna elements a powered by a transmitter tx the feed current for each antenna passes through a phase shifter φ controlled by a computer c the moving red lines show the wavefronts of the radio waves emitted by each element the individual wavefronts are spherical but they combine  superpose in front of the antenna to create a plane wave a beam of radio waves travelling in a specific direction the phase shifters delay the radio waves progressively going up the line so each antenna emits its wavefront later than the one below it this causes the resulting plane wave to be directed at an angle θ to the antennas axis by changing the phase shifts the computer can instantly change the angle θ of the beam most phased arrays have twodimensional arrays of antennas instead of the linear array shown here and the beam can be steered in two dimensions the velocity of the radio waves is shown slowed down enormously animation showing the radiation pattern of a phased array of 15 antenna elements spaced a quarter wavelength apart as the phase difference between adjacent antennas is swept between −120 and 120 degrees the dark area is the beam or main lobe while the light lines fanning out around it are sidelobes in antenna theory a phased array usually means an electronically scanned array a computercontrolled array of antennas which creates a beam of radio waves which can be electronically steered to point in different directions without moving the antennas 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 in an array antenna the radio frequency current from the transmitter is fed to the individual antennas with the correct phase relationship so that the radio waves from the separate antennas add together to increase the radiation in a desired direction while cancelling to suppress radiation in undesired directions in a phased array the power from the transmitter is fed to the antennas through devices called phase shifters controlled by a computer system which can alter the phase electronically thus steering the beam of radio waves to a different direction since the array must consist of many small antennas sometimes thousands to achieve high gain phased arrays are mainly practical at the high frequency end of the radio spectrum in the uhf and microwave bands in which the antenna elements are conveniently small phased arrays were invented for use in military radar systems to scan the radar beam quickly across the sky to detect planes and missiles these phased array radar systems are now widely used and phased arrays are spreading to civilian applications the phased array principle is also used in acoustics and phased arrays of acoustic transducers are used in medical ultrasound imaging scanners  phased array ultrasonics  oil and gas prospecting  reflection seismology  and military sonar systems the term is also used to a lesser extent for unsteered array antennas in which the phase of the feed power and thus the radiation pattern of the antenna is fixed 6 9 for example am broadcast radio antennas consisting of multiple mast radiators fed so as to create a specific radiation pattern are also called phased arrays contents  hide 1 types2 history21 broadcasting22 radar23 space probe communication24 weather research usage25 optics26

connected to a single transmitter andor receiver as shown in the animation at top pesas are the most common type of phased array an active phased array or active electronically scanned array aesa is a phased array in which each antenna element has its own transmitterreceiver unit all controlled by the computer active arrays are a more advanced secondgeneration phasedarray technology which are used in military applications unlike pesas they can radiate multiple beams of radio waves at multiple frequencies in different directions simultaneously a conformal antenna is a phased array in which the individual antennas instead of being arranged in a flat plane are mounted on a curved surface the phase shifters compensate for the different path lengths of the waves due to the antenna elements varying position on the surface allowing the array to radiate a plane wave conformal antennas are used in aircraft and missiles to integrate the antenna into the curving surface of the aircraft to reduce aerodynamic drag history  editferdinand braun s phased array from 1905 consisting of 3 monopole antennas in an equilateral triangle a quarterwave delay in the feedline of one antenna caused the array to radiate in a beam the delay could be switched into any of the 3 feeds rotating the antenna beam by 120° us pave paws active phased array ballistic missile detection radar in alaska completed in 1979 it was one of the first active phased arrays closeup of some of the 2677 crossed dipole antenna elements that make up the plane array this antenna produced a narrow pencil beam only 22° wide

world war iiphased array transmission was originally shown in 1905 by nobel laureate karl ferdinand braun who demonstrated enhanced transmission of radio waves in one direction 10 11 during world war ii nobel laureate luis alvarez used phased array transmission in a rapidly steerable radar system for  groundcontrolled approach  a system to aid in the landing of aircraft at the same time the gema in germany built the mammut 1 12 it was later adapted for radio astronomy leading to nobel prizes for physics for antony hewish and martin ryle after several large phased arrays were developed at the university of cambridge this design is also used for radar and is generalized in interferometric radio antennas in 2004 caltech researchers demonstrated the first integrated siliconbased phased array receiver at 24ghz with 8 elements 13 this was followed by their demonstration of a cmos 24ghz phased array transmitter in 2005 14 and a fully integrated 77ghz phased array transceiver with integrated antennas in 2006 15 16 by the caltech team in 2007 darpa researchers announced a 16 element phased array radar antenna which was also integrated with all the necessary circuits on a single silicon chip and operated at 30–50 ghz 17the relative amplitudes of—and constructive and destructive interference effects among—the signals radiated by the individual antennas determine the effective radiation pattern of the array a phased array may be used to point a fixed radiation pattern or to scan rapidly in azimuth or elevation simultaneous electrical scanning in both azimuth and elevation was first demonstrated in a phased array antenna at hughes aircraft company california in 1957 18optical phased array transmitters can form an optical beam which can be raster or vector scanned electronically to project images without using lenses or mechanically moving parts 19 optical phased array receivers have been demonstrated to be able to act as lensless cameras by selectively looking at different directions 20 21 phased arrays are also used in optical communication as a wavelength selective splitter for information about active and passive phased array radars see also active electronically scanned array broadcasting  editin broadcast engineering phased arrays are used by many am broadcast radio stations to enhance signal strength and therefore coverage in the city of license while minimizing interference to other areas due to the differences between daytime and nighttime ionospheric propagation at mediumwave frequencies it is common for am broadcast stations to change between day  groundwave and night  skywave radiation patterns by switching the phase and power levels supplied to the individual antenna elements  mast radiators daily at sunrise and sunset for shortwave broadcasts many stations use arrays of horizontal dipoles a common arrangement uses 16 dipoles in a 4×4 array usually this is in front of a wire grid reflector the phasing is often switchable to allow beam steering in azimuth and sometimes elevation more modest phased array longwire antenna systems may be employed by private radio enthusiasts to receive longwave mediumwave am and shortwave radio broadcasts from great distances on vhf phased arrays are used extensively for fm broadcasting these greatly increase the antenna gain magnifying the emitted rf energy toward the horizon which in turn greatly increases a stations broadcast range in these situations the distance to each element from the transmitter is identical or is one or other integer wavelength apart phasing the array such that the lower elements are slightly delayed by making the distance to them longer causes a downward beam tilt which is very useful if the antenna is quite high on a radio tower other phasing adjustments can increase the downward radiation in the far field without tilting the main lobe creating null fill to compensate for extremely high mountaintop locations or decrease it in the near field to prevent excessive exposure to those workers or even nearby homeowners on the ground the latter effect is also achieved by halfwave spacing – inserting additional elements halfway between existing elements with fullwave spacing this phasing achieves roughly the same horizontal gain as the fullwave spacing that is a fiveelement fullwavespaced array equals a nine or tenelement halfwavespaced array radar  editphased array radar systems are also used by warships of many navies because of the rapidity with which the beam can be steered phased array radars allow a warship to use one radar system for surface detection and tracking finding ships air detection and tracking finding aircraft and missiles and missile uplink capabilities before using these systems each surfacetoair missile in flight required a dedicated firecontrol radar which meant that radarguided weapons could only engage a small number of simultaneous targets phased array systems can be used to control missiles during the midcourse phase of the missiles flight during the terminal portion of the flight continuouswave fire control directors provide the final guidance to the target because the radar beam is electronically steered phased array systems can direct radar beams fast enough to maintain a fire control quality track on many targets simultaneously while also controlling several inflight missiles active phased array radar mounted on top of sachsen class frigate f220 hamburgs superstructure of the german navy the anspy1 phased array radar part of the aegis combat system

the phase shift between adjacent emitters is switched from 45 degrees to −45 degrees the radiation pattern of a phased array in polar coordinate system mathematically a phased array is an example of n slit diffraction in which the radiation field at the receiving point is the result of the coherent addition of n point sources in a line since each individual antenna acts as a slit emitting radio waves their diffraction pattern can be calculated by adding the phase shift φ to the fringing term we will begin from the n slit diffraction pattern derived on the diffraction formalism page with slits of equal size and spacing  now adding a φ term to the k d sin θ fringe effect in the second term yields    taking the square of the wave function gives us the intensity of the wave    now space the emitters a distance apart this distance is chosen for simplicity of calculation but can be adjusted as any scalar fraction of the wavelength  as sine achieves its maximum at we set the numerator of the second term  1 thus as n gets large the term will be dominated by the term as sine can oscillate between −1 and 1 we can see that setting will send the maximum energy on an angle given by additionally we can see that if we wish to adjust the angle at which the maximum energy is emitted we need only to adjust the phase shift φ between successive antennas indeed the phase shift corresponds to the negative angle of maximum signal a similar calculation will show that the denominator is minimized by the same factor different types of phased arrays  editthis section does not

messagemain article beamforming there are two main types of beamformers these are time domain beamformers and frequency domain beamformers a graduated attenuation window is sometimes applied across the face of the array to improve sidelobe suppression performance in addition to the phase shift time domain beamformer works by introducing time delays the basic operation is called delay and sum it delays the incoming signal from each array element by a certain amount of time and then adds them together the most common kind of time domain beam former is serpentine waveguide active phase array uses individual delay lines that are switched on and off yttrium iron garnet phase shifters vary the phase delay using the strength of a magnetic field there are two different types of frequency domain beamformers the first type separates the different frequency components that are present in the received signal into multiple frequency bins using either an discrete fourier transform dft or a filterbank  when different delay and sum beamformers are applied to each frequency bin the result is that the main lobe simultaneously points in multiple different directions at each of the different frequencies this can be an advantage for communication links and is used with the sps48 radar the other type of frequency domain beamformer makes use of spatial frequency discrete samples are taken from each of the individual array elements the samples are processed using a dft the dft introduces multiple different discrete phase shifts during processing the outputs of the dft are individual channels that correspond with evenly spaced beams formed simultaneously a 1dimensional dft produces a fan of different beams a 2dimensional dft produces beams with a pineapple configuration these techniques are used to create two kinds of phase array dynamic – an array of variable phase shifters are used to move the beam fixed – the beam position is stationary with respect to the array face and the whole antenna is moved there are two further subcategories that modify the kind of dynamic array or fixed array active – amplifiers or processors in each phase shifter element passive – large central amplifier with attenuating phase shifters dynamic phased array  editeach array element incorporates an adjustable phase shifter that are collectively used to move the beam with respect to the array face dynamic phase array require no physical movement to aim the beam the beam is moved electronically this can produce antenna motion fast enough to use a small pencilbeam to simultaneously track multiple targets while searching for new targets using just one radar set track while search as an example an antenna with a 2 degree beam with a pulse rate of 1 k hz will require approximately 8 seconds to cover an entire hemisphere consisting of 8000 pointing positions this configuration provides 12 opportunities to detect a 1000 ms 2200 mph 3600 kmh vehicle over a range of 100 km 62 mi which is suitable for military applications  citation neededthe position of mechanically steered antennas can be predicted which can be used to create electronic countermeasures that interfere with radar operation the flexibility resulting from phase array operation allows beams to be aimed at random locations which eliminates this vulnerability this is also desirable for military applications fixed phase array  editan antenna tower consisting of a fixed phase collinear antenna array with four elements fixed phase array antennas are typically used to create an antenna with a more desirable form factor than the conventional parabolic reflector or cassegrain reflector fixed phased arrays incorporate fixed phase shifters for example most commercial fm radio and tv antenna towers use a collinear antenna array which is a fixed phased array of dipole elements in radar applications this kind of phase array is physically moved during the track and scan process there are two configurations multiple frequencies with a delayline multiple adjacent beams the sps48 radar uses multiple transmit frequencies with a serpentine delay line along the left side of the array to produce vertical fan of stacked beams each frequency experiences a different phase shift as it propagates down the serpentine delay line which forms different beams a filter bank is used to split apart the individual receive beams the antenna is mechanically rotated semiactive radar homing uses monopulse radar that relies on a fixed phase array to produce multiple adjacent beams that measure angle errors this form factor is suitable for gimbal mounting in missile seekers active phase array  editactive electronically scanned arrays aesa elements incorporate transmit amplification with phase shift in each antenna element or group of elements each element also includes receive preamplification the phase shifter setting is the same for transmit and receive active phase array do not require phase reset after the end of the transmit pulse which is compatible with doppler radar and pulsedoppler radar 32passive phase array  editpassive phased arrays typically use large amplifiers that produce all of the microwave transmit signal for the antenna phase shifters typically consist of waveguide elements that contain phase shifters controlled by magnetic field voltage gradient or equivalent technology 33 34the phase shift process used with passive phase array typically puts the receive beam and transmit beam into diagonally opposite quadrants the sign of the phase shift must be inverted after the transmit pulse is finished and before the receive period begins to place the receive beam into the same location as the transmit beam that requires a phase impulse that degrades subclutter visibility performance on doppler radar and pulsedoppler radar as an example yttrium iron garnet phase shifters must be changed after transmit pulse quench and before receiver processing starts to align transmit and receive beams that impulse introduces fm noise that degrades clutter performance passive phase array is used with aegis 35 for directionofarrival estimation see also
