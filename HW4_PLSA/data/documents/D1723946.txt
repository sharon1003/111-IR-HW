smerling added that the restrictions put in place by facebook are futile and nearimpossible to execute he added it’s unenforceable it’s like having a big bowl of candy and not letting them have any the internet is everywhere around us you can’t get away from it you just have to have a long conversation about the rules facebook founder mark zuckerberg wants to lift the age restrictions put in his social networking site facebook founder mark zuckerberg has previously spoken of his desire to see the sites age restriction lifted currently the facebook age limit is set by the childrens online privacy protection act which was made federal law in america in 1998 but zuckerberg said in may he wants to fight to change the law citing the educational benefits of using the site as justification he said that will be a fight we take on at some point my philosophy is that for education you need to start at a really really young age because of the legal restrictions we havent even begun this learning process if theyre lifted then wed start to learn what works earlier this year focus groups for credos a think tank which advises the advertising industry reported that 8090 percent of under

i would never allow my 12 and 10 year old to have one i get too many weirdos sending me invites and have even had someone message me posing as fb security trying to get my info i dont feel my boys are mature enough to handle these situations just like i wouldnt allow them to stay in a room where grownup talk was happening why would i allow them on a social site where they would be exposed to the same thing there are plenty of children safe sites they can play on while i understand that children must be educated on the evils in this world to keep them safe i feel kids should be treated as kids not little adults716click to rateghotr san antonio u s 6 years ago try notifying facebook of underage children and they make it very hard after learning my 10 yr old twin granddaughters had their own pages with birth year listing them as 4 and 5 years older i tried mainly because it appeared that they could not access them there was no activity on them except for mother and boyfriend was this new unknown boyfriend trolling for other young ladies plus there was no responses to my interactions though they had befriended me i had a hard time learning where to go and filling out their form i was unable to identify 2 pieces of information that facebook wanted i finally received a response that they could do nothing without the missing information but there was no information as to what the information was i had given them all birth dates mother and boyfriends identification but they were not interested facebook is only interested in themselves and i worry29click to rate john tulsa usa 6

predators on facebook and we need to keep one step ahead to keep our children safe never allow a child to take a laptop into the privacy of their bedroom especially if it has a built in webcam make sure their privacy settings are solidly secured so noone can access photos andor information unless on their friends list enforce the importance of never adding someone they have not physically met have an account yourself and check your childs account regularly preferably have their log in details until they are old enough and responsible enough to manage their own account and even then still keep an eye on top of all this be aware of the dangers of smart phones they can give out their location its like any good tool fantastic if used properly and safety measures are adhered to1317click to
