eye redness here can be due to engorged blood vessels on the surface of the eye or due to hemorrhage on the surface the location and pattern of redness may be important to making a diagnosis as may be any associated symptoms and findings this page discusses a few causes of eye redness which are not discussed elsewhere there are also links to other symptom and diagnosis pages based on other symptoms in addition to the redness conjunctivitis pink eyesubconjunctival hemorrhage episcleritis medication eye drop toxicity pterygium other conditions causing eye redness found on other pagesconjunctivitis or pink eye is an infection of the membrane that covers the sclera or the white of the eye this lining is the conjunctiva and it also lines the inside of the eyelids the infection is typically either caused by a virus or by bacteria viral conjunctivitis is common in adults and is extremely contagious even with indirect contact sometimes it may occur with the common cold the eyes become injected and itch there may be a watery or mucoid discharge and the lids may swell both eyes are usually affected treatment is to reduce symptoms since antibiotics are ineffective and antiviral medication is not available for this condition it usually runs its course in about 2 weeks care must be taken to wash the hands after touching the eyes and disposing of tissues used to wipe the eyes to help prevent spread to other people bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in children while also contagious it requires more direct contact for spread than a viral infection eye redness lid swelling and a heavy puslike discharge are common treatment with antibiotic eye drops ointments and sometimes even pills by mouth are necessary for treatment cultures may be taken to determine the bacteria involved and to select appropriate antibiotics a subconjunctival hemorrhage usually appears as a sudden spontaneous bright red patch on the surface of the eye this occurs when a small blood vessel breaks in the lining over the eye the conjunctiva it is usually otherwise painless and the vision is not affected the redness can be quite dramatic this can occur spontaneously or after direct trauma sneezing or coughing or straining it often happens overnight while sleeping high blood pressure is another possible cause the redness usually disappears over a one week period while blood thinners do no typically cause this condition it may make it appear worse there are rare cases of clotting disorders that can also lead to this condition in some cases the hemorrhage can stretch the conjunctiva which can cause pain in these cases the conjunctiva might be swollen or raised and could lead to patches of dryness on the cornea due to a disturbance in the tear flow that lubricates the eye episcleritis is an inflammation of the episclera which is a fibrous layer between the white wall of the eye the sclera and the lining of the eye the conjunctiva with this condition there is a patch of injected blood vessels on the surface of the eye only a part of the eye is red it may be associated with mild irritation or sometimes iritis the condition may resolve without treatment but it also can recur and may affect both eyes it sometimes is associated with gout many prescription and nonprescription eye drops can create ocular irritation or allergy especially if used for a long period of time overthecounter eye drops such as artificial tears allergy eye drops and contact lens solutions all contain preservatives unless the bottle specifically states preservative free these preservatives can commonly cause eye irritation and redness if the user is sensitive to that preservative prescription antibiotic eye drops can be effective at treating infection but they can also be quite irritating to the eye and may cause prolonged irritation and redness this may lead to confusion as to whether or not the infection has really been treated steroid eye drops usually are not particularly irritating a few prescription allergy eye drops are known to cause some eye redness and burning on installation vasoconstricting or decongestant eye drops get the red out drops simply blanch out blood vessels on the eye surface concealing redness if these eye drops are used frequently to mask redness there may be a rebound redness when the drops are discontinued this may lead to more usage of the eye drop to conceal the worsening redness a pterygium is a noncancerous growth of the conjunctiva onto the cornea it may start as a pingueculum which is a small lump of tissue located on either side of the cornea on the sclera a pterygium has a head which may progressively cover the cornea and a body which extends toward the corner of the eye usually the inside corner often the body of a pterygium may appear red with noticeable blood vessels a pterygium which progressively moves toward the pupil may need to be surgically removed in order to prevent the vision from being affected redness and irritation from a pterygium can be managed with artificial tears and with other prescription eye drops pterygia seem to occur more frequently in people who spent much time outside and is especially common in the southern latitudes if they need to be removed there is a possibility of recurrence a link to each condition is listed along with other hallmark features of the condition
