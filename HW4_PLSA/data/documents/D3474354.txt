pomegranate is a fruit that has a hard outer shell within which there is a multitude of small tasty seeds the pomegranate appears often in symbolism and mythology because this fruit contains an enormous amount of seeds it is regarded as a symbol of fertility prosperity abundance and generosity in mythology the pomegranate is a featured symbol in the abduction of persephone one day when persephone was wandering about the earth she was noticed by hades lord of the underworld who instantly fell in love with her hades abducted persephone and took her to his domain in the underworld to live with him as his wife and queen demeter persephones mother upon noticing that her daughter had been abducted by hades immediately caused all plants to stop growing upon the face of the earth trees flowers fruits vegetables and grains all ceased to grow demeter then filed a grievance with zeus regarding the abduction of her daughter by hades in which she informed zeus that she would not allow any growth to occur on earth until persephone was returned to her although zeus was not interested in becoming involved with the affairs of other gods and goddesses he also realized that he could not allow the earth to remain cold and barren for this would mean the end of all life on the planet zeus eventually mediated an agreement between demeter and hades in which persephone would spend half of the year on earth and the other half of the year in the underworld demeter consented to this agreement and for the half of the year in which persephone walked upon the earth demeter allowed the plants to grow blossom and bear fruit for the six months that persephone spent in the underworld demeter caused all growth to go dormant this agreement between demeter zeus and hades enabled persephone to be the only other being mortal or immortal besides hermes mercury and hades himself who was permitted to leave the underworld after having entered its confines an interesting point to consider in this particular myth is the fact that when persephone is portrayed with her husband hades in the underworld she is not depicted as someone who has been abducted and held prisoner against her will her countenance is that of a contented woman who is both wife and queen to her beloved husband we also notice that persephone is often portrayed holding a pomegranate in her hand since the pomegranate is the symbol of fertility and abundance this reminds us that when persephone arrives upon the earth in the springtime she brings with her all the seeds of fertility prosperity and abundance this is the time when the earth is in full bloom and life rejoices in autumn when she returns to her husband and her queendom in the underworld she takes the pomegranate with her during this time of the year the earth goes dormantit sleepsit rests the tale of persephone and the pomegranate is a metaphor for the continual cycle of growth dormancy and regrowth which governs all things in the physical realm this myth also reminds us that when persephone returns to the underworld and the world goes dormant the seeds of growth fertility and abundance do not vanish from the world forever they are kept eternally warm and protected deep within the womb of mother earth and await the next annual earthly visit of persephone and the cycle of abundance growth and prosperity which she and her fertile pomegranate
