because their blood clots poorly they have difficulty stopping the flow of blood from a wound this may be referred to as prolonged bleeding or a prolonged bleeding episode hemophilia a can be mild moderate or severe depending on the baseline level of factor viii made by that individual in mild cases prolonged bleeding episodes may only occur after surgery dental procedures or trauma in more severely affected individuals symptoms may include prolonged bleeding from minor wounds painful swollen bruises and unexplained spontaneous bleeding into vital organs as well as joints and muscles
