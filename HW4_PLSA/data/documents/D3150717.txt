foundation squaring calculator this calculator requires the use of javascript enabled and capable browsers this calculator is designed to give the result of a math calculation to verify that a foundation or room truss foundation or other 90 degree structure is actually square and correct in layout be square or repair the calculation is based on the pythagorean theorem reduced to simple construction terms it says that the foundation length squared plus the foundation width squared equals the foundation diagonal distance opposite corner to opposite corner squared it is also known in the construction industry as 345 meaning the if the length is 3 squared  9 and the width is 4 squared  16 then the diagonal is 5 squared  25 verification is true in that 9 plus 16 is 25 of which the square root is 5 while protractors and tsquares are very useful the longer the distance for the measurement the more accurate it is if you dont want to actually measure but can determine by a sting both diagonals must be equal for a squared foundation just a fraction of a degree deviation from 90 degrees over 20 feet or more is a substantial error in causing walls to not be straight or square a little extra effort in the initial stages yields a much more professional structure in the end this calculator is capable of use in the american system of feet and inches and the metric system of meters select the american or metric number system first in the feet and inches mode american system enter your value of feet indicated as feet then the inches if there are any in the box indicated as inches if you have a fraction of an inch you may enter it keep in mind that this is a decimal fraction for example 5 is 12 inch and 75 is 34 inch if you are uncertain as to the conversion you may use our conversion tables for precision up to 64ths of an inch in decimal if you already know the conversion of inches to a decimal you may just enter it as feet for example you could enter 5 feet 6 inches as 5 in the feet box and 6 in the inches box or just 55 in the feet box and no entry in the inches box in the metric mode only the first box on length and width is used the system and calculator accept decimals the answer is returned in feet inches and construction fractions to 64ths in the american mode while the metric mode returns meters and decimal values if you do more than one calculation be sure to click on the clear values button between attempts square foundation verification required data entry measurements in american mode metric mode length width calculated results foundation diagonal measurement updated 81311
