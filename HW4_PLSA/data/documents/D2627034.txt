generation antipsychotic bradycardia hypotension abstract quetiapine is increasingly used for the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in elderly patients among the many potential side effects of secondgeneration antipsychotics the sudden onset of cardiac abnormality is a particularly important side effect to consider due its fatal implications elderly patients may be particularly vulnerable to these cardiacrelated side effects due to the likelihood that they have multiple existing health conditions eg heart disease high blood pressure diabetes as well as agerelated changes in their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and differences in their receptor binding profiles we present a case of an elderly man with a history of heart disease who developed symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension simultaneously while taking quetiapine after dose reduction and withdrawal of quetiapine a time sequential improvement of bradycardia and hypotension monitored by repeated electrocardiogram and blood pressure checks suggests a relationship between the higher dosage of quetiapine and cardiac abnormalities other factors such as aging itself and chronic heart failure might be associated with cardiac distress elderly patients on quetiapine particularly at higher dosages should be continually and closely monitored for any symptoms of cardiac distress introduction quetiapine is a secondgeneration antipsychotic sga that is prescribed for a broad spectrum of psychiatric conditions including offlabel uses for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia bpsd among the many potential side effects of sgas the sudden onset of cardiac abnormality is a particularly important side effect to consider due its fatal implications elderly patients may be particularly vulnerable to these cardiacrelated side effects due to the likelihood that they have multiple existing health conditions eg heart disease high blood pressure diabetes as well as agerelated changes in their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and differences in their receptor binding profiles 1 we present a case of an elderly man with a history of heart disease who developed symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension simultaneously while taking quetiapine case vignette a 72yearold japanese male patient with a diagnosis of alcohol dementia was admitted to our hospital’s dementia unit for worsening of bpsd one month earlier he had started taking quetiapine 25mgday and brotizolam 025mgday for disorientation and insomnia and was being treated with furosemide 10mgday and spironolactone 25mgday for chronic heart failure at admission the patient’s pulse rate was 69 beat per minute bpm his blood pressure was 12283mm hg and a 12lead electrocardiogram ecg showed regular sinus rhythm with minimal qtc interval prolongation qtc interval480 msec his score on minimental state examination was 1830 and there were no particular abnormalities in the physical exam laboratory workup and chest xray were all within normal limits except for mild elevation of nterminal fragment pro brain type natriuretic peptide ntpro bnp302pgm l to treat his irritability and aggressiveness we gradually increased his quetiapine dosage so that in two weeks the dosage was 100mgday we performed another ecg at this time which showed a normal sinus rhythm of 60bpm qtc interval461 msec over the next month we continued to titrate the quetiapine to the final dosage of 225mgday and his psychotic symptoms stabilized after three months the patient abruptly complained of sleepiness and feebleness and was noted to have bradysphygmia 48bpm with low blood pressure 7844mm hg an ecg was performed and was suggestive of sinus bradycardia 41bpm  qtc interval452msec with supraventricular extrasystole rhythm figure 1 there were no new abnormal findings in the laboratory tests ntpro bnp311pgm l chest xray and echocardiogram and the dose escalation of quetiapine was the only medication change he had received since his initial evaluation taking into consideration his current and previous ecgs we suspected that quetiapine at 225mgday was contributing to his decrease in heart rate and blood pressure we reduced his quetiapine dosage to 100mgday his severe bradycardia and hypotension persisted for about 72 hours without additional internal treatment seven days later a followup ecg revealed improvement in bradycardia 50bpm and blood pressure 11070mm hg however reappearance of irritability and aggressiveness in the patient forced us to fully discontinue the quetiapine and initiate valproic acid at 400mgday while his other medications were continued at the same dosages over the next month the severe bradycardia and hypotension resolved discussion the temporal correlation between quetiapine and the appearance of bradycardia and hypotension in our patient supported our suspician that quetiapine possibly due to its higher dosage directly contributed to the cardiac abnormalities seen in our patient bradycardia has been reported as a severe adverse effect of sgas such as risperidone olanzapine and clozapine though the precise mechanism that causes bradyarrhythmogenic characteristics in sgas has not been fully elucidated numerous studies have explored other adverse effects of sgas such as abnormal qt interval interference with potassium ion transport to cardiac ventricular cells and differences in medication distribution between the myocardium and plasma 2 one study reported that most antipsychotic drugs block the human etheràgogo–related gene h erg and potassium andor sodium ion channels not as their therapeutic effect and cause a concentrationdependent bradycardia in rat embryonic hearts 3 blockade of the potassium andor sodium ion channels is manifested on ecg as qt prolongation and is sometimes associated with the potentially fatal conduction of torsade de pointes hypotension can be attributed to circulatory insufficiency due to severe bradycardia quetiapine is a selective monoaminergic antagonist to dopaminergic d2 serotoninergic 5ht2a 5ht2c histaminergic h1 muscarinic m1 m3 and adrenergic a1a2 receptors and a partial agonist to 5ht1a receptors 4 there are several hypotheses that attempt to explain receptor blockade effects one hypothesis is that the central administration of 5ht can cause bradycardia or tachycardia and hypo or hypertension mediated by activation of 5ht1a and 5ht2 receptors another hypothesis suggests that alpha1adrenegic antagonism with peripheral vasodilatation causes postural hypotension and compensatory tachycardia we believe that the lack of betaadrenergic affinity causes a sympatholytic effect that is exerted from the central instead of peripheral system since quetiapine possesses alpha2 affinity this receptor upregulation in the brain stem may induce bradycardia and hypotension at the same time another point of consideration is that aging itself can contribute to an undesirably high concentration of quetiapine in the blood by decreasing hepatic activity of cyp3a4 which is the major metabolizing isoenzyme of quetiapine 5limitation the relatively long amount of time 3 months that passed between the final dosage escalation of quetiapine and the appearance of the cardiac symptoms in our patient limits our conclusion though we believe the higher dosage of quetiapine directly contributed to our patient’s cardiac symptoms there were several other risk factors present in our patient that could have also contributed to his cardiac distress conclusion we suggest that clinicians remain vigilent for signs or symptoms of adverse effects in their elderly patients who take sgas elderly patients with histories of heart failure myocardial infarction andor conduction abnormalities may be particularly vulnerable to cardiac abnormalities while on quetiapine particularly at higher dosages and thus should be continually and closely monitored for any symptoms of cardiac distress references1 gareri p de fazio p de fazio s et al adverse effects of atypical antipsychotics in the elderly a review drugs aging 200623937–956 2 nielsen j graff c kanters
