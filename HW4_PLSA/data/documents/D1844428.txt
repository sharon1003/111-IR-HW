experienced esthetician pros improves skin texture cons takes several intense treatments the hydra facial treatment aka hydradermabrasion has been gaining popularity in the spa industry and been featured in many trade publications the hydra facial was performed on the reality show the real housewives of beverly hills and while i don’t watch reality television does cnbc count  my research revealed the facial was a success at the housewives’ inhouse spa party the treatment was also demonstrated on the show the doctors in an episode declaring water as the no1 secret to living longer and looking younger the facial has also been featured on various news channels as an effective antiaging procedure how does hydra facial work the hydra facial reportedly exfoliates while simultaneously hydrating skin and is known to be quick approximately 15 minutes and painless usually with immediate visible effects after one treatment it is marketed as a specialized facial designed for all skin types even sensitive skin not rosacea and treats a variety of skin issues including acne not cystic fine lines and hyperpigmentation there is no skin irritation or downtime and the smoothness and hydration should last five to seven days a study conducted on the efficacy of hydradermabrasion backed by the manufacturer edge systems reported clinical improvements to facial tone and texture less dyschromia skin discoloration and fewer fine lines curious to see if the treatment lived up to the hype i decided to try it out sign up for our newsletter to get the latest product reviews and save 10 on all orders over 50my hydra facial experience my hydra facial was performed in the office of ny plastic surgeon dr amiya prasad who incidentally has administered hydra facials to the the real housewives of jericho  as i was in a medical office and not a spa i received a nofrills treatment completed in less than 20 minutes timewise the hydra facial is an ideal procedure for me  i find it difficult to sit still through a manicure the hydra facial is a serumbased resurfacing system administered via a trademarked machine there is an assortment of proprietary serums consisting of ahabha acids antioxidants peptides and vitamininfused hyaluronic acid the serums used during the facial depend on skin type and conditions the procedure employs two types of exfoliation a gentle version of crystalfree microdermabrasion and a mild pneumatic chemical peel skin is hydrated throughout the facial with water infused with antioxidants and vitamins dispensed from a wand connected to the system each step in the facial uses a different hydro peel tip attached to the wand the resurfacing tip is placed directly on the skin’s surface and physically exfoliates the skin while simultaneously delivering active serums to chemically exfoliate manual extractions are not performed similar to microdermabrasion there is a vacuum motion from the wand that is used throughout the facial with the exception of the last step which is purely hydration overall i enjoyed the hydra facial and was happy with the results my face was incredibly smooth soft and well hydrated there was no downtime and i was able to go straight to a meeting right after the facial it does improve skin texture and i found the exfoliation to be gentle yet effective i felt my athome products also penetrated better after the treatment the hydration from the facial lasted for a few days  longer than after a traditional facial however i think it would take several intense treatments to have an effect on acne fine lines or hyperpigmentation it’s likely that even sensitive skin types can benefit from this facial but i believe the results would largely depend on the skills and experience of the person administering the treatment hence i would recommend having the treatment at a spa or doctor’s office that has been using the system for some time if you’d like to try the hydra facial locate a provider near you read more is hydrafacial right for me hydrafacial is suitable for sensitive skin hydrafacial is an effective form of exfoliation hydrafacial requires several repeat treatments hydrafacial must be administered by an experienced esthetician may 28 2015by alexis yes with a pacemaker you can receive the treatment there is no electrical currents in the treatment you can still receive a hydra facial while taking cuimadin just be sure to write that on your consent form or tell your technician the price of the treatment is now changing to a minimum of 150 across the board you should try finding a provider in your area that offer package promotions the service warrants its price the technology behind the treatment is delivering greater results than anything else on the market this is the only piece of equipment with our patented vortexfusion tm technology this is how the serums are directly infused into the skin the hydra facial works within your skin not on top of it the hydra facial was

area that you are in this device is well worth it for owners and for clients it delivers immediate results that will last 7 14 days with no pain and no discomfort plus its for all skin types the hydra facial out preforms any other service in the industry i am an aesthetician and have been using the hydra facial for years now i love the results both my clients and i get all of the price points you are mentioning are very average if not on the lower end of the scale carolyn that is a very good price for the hydra facial i am also a representative for the hydra facial and i go to many different offices the prices stated above like i said are on the lower end they are very fair may 28 2013by marina12900 its a good pice for hydra facial i pay 16000 per treatment ind i think for the results i have its worth the money i pay april 3 2013by larry that price is a little bit higher that normal the price is probably to offset machine cost which is well over 20k my wife is a master esthetician and an administrator at a beauty school and there cost is lower due to treatments being student performed the great part of this machine is that student or master the machine is simple to use and provides great results it by far the best treatment i have had performed on me march 12 2013by carolyn my doctor charges 12900 for this treatment and i dont reallly think a few days benefit is worth it is this price normal prev 1 next join the discussion leave a comment below my comment add a comment your email will not be published im not a robotre captchaprivacy  terms post commentor cancel
