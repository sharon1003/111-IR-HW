what is a chargeoff share tweet what does a “chargeoff” of my credit card account mean at first glance the term “chargeoff” kind of sounds like the balance is gone done eliminated nothing could be further from the truth here is what a chargeoff status means for your credit card debt a chargeoff means your account is delinquent and the credit card company is viewing it as a business loss in other words they’ve figured out that you aren’t going to be paying them anytime soon and it’s sort of an inhouse shuffle of your account to a different status or department typically a bank will only chargeoff an account after several months of not making at least the minimum payment many credit card companies do a chargeoff after 180 days or six months of delinquency and attempts to collect what happens after a chargeoff of your account at least two things happen after a chargeoff that directly affect you first moving the account to chargeoff status allows the bank to sell the debt to a debt buyer or bring in a debt collection agency to try to collect in other words the bank is done trying to get the money from you and it’s time to bring in the “mercenaries” when the bank sells your debt to a debt buyer or third party debt collector it typically sells it for much less than the balance owed just because the debt buyer paid less than the face amount however doesn’t mean they will be any less aggressive in trying to collect the full amount for all practical purposes you will now be dealing with the company that bought your debt from the bank they may start contacting you right away or wait months or even years the second thing that happens is that the chargeoff is reported to the credit bureaus and appears on your credit report it may stay there for as long as seven years what should you do if your account has been chargedoff if your account has been charged off you are at a critical fork in the road and your next move counts it is likely that the new debt buyer is going to get very aggressive in trying to collect against you even if you don’t hear from them right away chances are they are lying in wait until your credit report shows some activity that leads them to believe you have some money somewhere either way you’ll probably have to deal with them sooner or later but the chargeoff status also presents an opportunity a skilled attorney negotiator can use your legal position and leverage to confront the debt buyer and settle the account for a fraction of the balance in fact when done right this can be a very opportune time to negotiate a favorable settlement if done wrong or the opportunity is missed it can lead the debt collector right to your bank account or even lead to garnishment of your wages if your credit card account has been chargedoff and you are struggling with debt please contact our firm for a free consultation with an attorney you have options and this is a great time to learn about the strategies that can get you out of debt without bankruptcy share tweet
