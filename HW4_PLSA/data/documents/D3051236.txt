the sciences crawling may be unnecessary for normal child development in some tribes babies skip the crawl by kate wong on july 1 2009babies must crawl before they walk parents and pediatricians agree crawling has also been held up as a prerequisite to the normal progression of other aspects of neuromuscular and neurological development such as handeye coordination and social maturation but new research may knock the legs out from under this conventional wisdom according to anthropologist david tracer of the university of colorado at boulder babies of the au huntergatherers of papua new guinea do not go through a crawling stage instead their parents and other caregivers carry them until they can walk yet au children do not appear to suffer any ill effects from skipping this phase in a presentation given to the american association of physical anthropologists in chicago this past april tracer argued that in fact not crawling may be entirely normal and possibly even adaptive in his observations of 113 au motherchild pairs tracer found that babies up to 12 months old were carried upright in a sling 86 percent of the time on the rare occasions when the mothers put their infants on the ground they propped them up in a sitting position rather than placing them down on their stomachs as a result of spending all of that time upright au kids never learn to crawl they do however go through a scoot phase in which they sit upright and propel themselves along on their bottoms tracer says the au believe that this scooting rather than crawling is the universal human prewalking phase the au are not alone in discouraging their children from crawling tracer notes that babies in a number of other traditional societies—including ones in paraguay mali and indonesia—are raised this way furthermore he observes neither do our closest living relatives chimpanzees and gorillas put their youngsters on the ground very often thus it may well be that our early hominid ancestors toted their babies around too rather than letting them crawl citing a study of bangladeshi children showing that crawling significantly increases the risk of contracting diarrhea tracer proposes that carrying infants limits their exposure to ground pathogens it also protects them from predators he therefore contends that the crawling stage is a recent invention—one that emerged only within the past century or two after humans began living in elevated houses with flooring which would have been much more hygienic than dirt wenda trevathan an anthropologist at new mexico state university agrees that babies were probably rarely placed on the ground in the past adding glowing embers as another potential hazard tracer’s work “highlights how narrowly we view normal infant development” she remarks “and calls into question the tendency to judge all human infants on the basis of western infants”note this article was originally printed with the title hitching a ride rights  permissions about the author skate wong kate wong is a senior editor for evolution and ecology at scientific american credit nick higgins recent articles ancient cave paintings clinch the case for neandertal symbolism stone tools from india fan debate over origins of cultural complexity controversial fossil hints homo sapiens blazed a trail out of africa earlier than thought latest news space nasas next exoplanet hunter will seek worlds close to home10 hours ago — alexandra witze and nature magazine biotech beijing launches pioneering brainscience center11 hours ago — david cyranoski and nature magazine policy  ethics to meet emissions goals seattle wants to charge drivers11 hours ago — camille von kaenel and ee news environment epas proposed rollbacks of mileage standards is a terrible idea14 hours ago — rob jackson behavior  society how to avoid business disasters with behavioral science15 hours ago — gleb tsipursky biology orangutans use plant extracts to treat pain15 hours ago — doug main in the store scientific american july 2009799
