still allow you to move them without taking flight2 when transporting your monarch outside move your finger toward the butterfly’s head so it can crawl on3 once your monarch has climbed aboard the finger express bring your hand in toward your body…pull gently to fully remove your butterfly from the chrysalis4 cup your other hand over the butterfly so it doesn’t try to fly away4a this is an

monte loomis photography a better way this is so simple and the only reason i didn’t start doing this sooner is because i used to take a lot of photos of newly hatched monarchs in fact if i’m snapping photos for this blog i’ll still use the old method with a watchful however if you want to release more active monarchs that can easily elude predators and territorial male monarchs try this bring your mesh enclosure outdoors with your new butterflies hanging inside i suggest having a second mesh enclosure for keeping and releasing butterfliesset the cage in a sunny area or hang it from a shepherds

option monarchs can still fly in sunny conditions in the 50’srain light rain isn’t a problem for butterflies with dry wings and a full stomach but it’s not prime conditions for rookies taking their first flightlate hatching if butterflies eclose too late to get 3 hours in the sun keep them overnightstorms in the forecast if there’s at least 4 hours of good weather beforehand you can release them…otherwise i would wait if extreme weather is forecast in the next 24 hours keep them safe until the passes 24 hours should provide them ample time to find shelter from the storm feeding adult butterflies if keeping butterflies more than 24 hours you can feed them cut nectar flowers orangewatermelon slices or place cotton ballscotton swabs soaked in gatorade juicy juice hummingbird nectar honey water 9 parts water to 1 part honey or sugar water 9 parts water to 1 part sugar on the mesh cage roof so butterflies can feed hanging from inside don’t worry if butterflies go on a hunger strike …they will eventually eat when they are hungry enough or after they are finally released monarchs can be kept indefinitely from the roof of their mesh cage this is why it’s good to have an extra cage that’s just for butterflies in case there’s an unusual streak of bad weather or you choose to care for a flightless butterfly if flight ful butterflies are not kept in a secure cage they
