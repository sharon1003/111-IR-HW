weight decrease management 3polyneuropathy  poly  neuro  pathy is damage or disease affecting peripheral nerves  peripheral neuropathy in roughly the same areas on both sides of the body featuring weakness numbness and burning pain 3 it usually begins in the hands and feet and may progress to the arms and legs and sometimes to other parts of the body where it may affect the autonomic nervous system it may be acute or chronic a number of different disorders may cause polyneuropathy including diabetes and some types of guillain–barré syndrome 4 5 6contents  hide 1 classification2 signs and symptoms3 causes4 pathophysiology5 diagnosis51 differential diagnosis6 treatment7 see also8 references9 further reading10 external links classification  editpolyneuropathies may be classified in different ways such as by cause 1 by presentation 3 or by classes of polyneuropathy in terms of which part of the nerve cell is affected mainly the axon the myelin sheath or the cell body 7 8action potential propagation in myelinated neurons is faster than in unmyelinated neurons leftdistal axonopathy is the result of interrupted function of the peripheral nerves 9 it is the most common response of neurons to metabolic or toxic disturbances and may be caused by metabolic diseases such as diabetes kidney failure connective tissue disease deficiency syndromes such as malnutrition and alcoholism or the effects of toxins or drugs such as chemotherapy they may be divided according to the type of axon affected largefiber smallfiber or both the most distal portions of axons are usually the first to degenerate and axonal atrophy advances slowly toward the nerves cell body however if the cause is removed regeneration is possible although the prognosis depends on the duration and severity of the stimulus  medical citation needed people with distal axonopathies usually present with sensorimotor disturbances such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 10myelinopathy is due to a loss of myelin or of the schwann cells 11 this demyelination slows down or completely blocks the conduction of action potentials through the axon of the nerve cell neuraplaxia 12 the most common cause is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy aidp the most common form of guillain–barré syndrome 13 although other causes include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy  14neuronopathy is the result of issues in the peripheral nervous system pns neurons they may be caused by motor neurone diseases sensory neuronopathies toxins or autonomic dysfunction neurotoxins such as chemotherapy agents may cause neuronopathies 15signs and symptoms  editamong the signssymptoms of polyneuropathy which can be divided into sensory and hereditary and are consistent with the following 3sensory polyneuropathy – ataxia numbness muscle wasting and paraesthesiae hereditary polyneuropathy – scoliosis and hammer toes causes  editthe causes of polyneuropathy can be divided into hereditary and acquired and are therefore as follows 1inherited are hereditary motor neuropathies charcot–marie–tooth disease and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy acquired are diabetes mellitus vascular neuropathy alcohol abuse and vitamin b12 deficiency pathophysiology  edithuman t cell in regards to the pathophysiology of polyneuropathy of course the former depends on which polyneuropathy for instance in the case of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy one finds that it is a autoimmune disease here t cells involvement has been demonstrated while in terms of demyelination antibodies alone are not capable 16diagnosis  editmicrograph of a muscle biopsy the diagnosis of polyneuropathies begins with a history and physical examination to ascertain the pattern of the disease process such asarms legs distal proximal if they fluctuate and what deficits and pain are involved if pain is a factor determining where and how long the pain has been present is important one also needs to know what disorders are present within the family and what diseases the person may have although diseases often are suggested by the physical examination and history alone tests that may be employed include electrodiagnostic testing serum protein electrophoresis nerve conduction studies urinalysis serum creatine kinase ck and antibody testing nerve biopsy is sometimes done 3 2other tests may be used especially tests for specific disorders associated with polyneuropathies quality measures have been developed to diagnose patients with distal symmetrical polyneuropathy dsp 17differential diagnosis  editin terms of the differential diagnosis for polyneuropathy one must look at the following vitamin deficiency 18diabetes mellitus 18toxins 18guillain–barré syndrome 18lyme disease 18hepatitis c 18amyloidosis 18acromegaly 18kidney failure 19treatment  editmethylprednisolone in the treatment of polyneuropathies one must ascertain and manage the cause among management activities are weight decrease use of a walking aid and occupational therapist assistance additionally bp control in those with diabetes is helpful while intravenous immunoglobulin is used for multifocal motor neuropathy 3according to lopate et al methylprednisolone is a viable treatment for chronic inflammatory demyelinative polyneuropathy which can also be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin the author s also indicate that prednisone has greater adverse effects in such treatment as opposed to intermittent highdoses of the aforementioned medication 3 20according to wu et al in critical illness polyneuropathy supportive and preventive therapy are important for the affected individual as well as avoiding or limiting corticosteroids 21see also  edithereditary neuropathy with liability to
