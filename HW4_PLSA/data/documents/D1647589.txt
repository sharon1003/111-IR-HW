viewsi am so sorry for your loss give your friend a warm hug offer to help with the wake the family usually deals with the funeral and when the dust has settled and everyone has gone back to their own lives be there for your friend ring him or her regularly to ask how theyre getting along and ask questions about your friends mum most people wont want to talk to the bereaved about their loved one but believe me the son or daughter may well want to talk about little traits the mother had things she said or did if you knew the lady you can add little anecdotes about her which your friend will appreciate sometimes the bereaved need time before they can talk about their loved one but just wait and make yourself available always remember that no matter how old we are when our last parent dies

author has 940 answers and 19m answer views the main thing is to say or do something to show you care too many people dont contact the grieving familyperson out of fear that they will say the wrong thing sometimes it is enough to call and say i heard about your mother ive been greatly comforted in times of loss by friends whove said my name and nothing else i went to a funeral once where a group of motorcyclists arrived en masse after the other guests were seated the memory of their bikes roaring into the parking lot still brings tears to my eyes not a one of them said a word to anyone they just filed silently into the church chains tattoos and all sat in silence during the service and then roared off into the distance afterwards it was one of the most memorable tributes ive ever experienced and yet no one spoke a word958k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to date jon barnes father of two beautiful daughters answered may 14 2015 · author has 551 answers and 5702k answer views my friends father passed away a few weeks ago it was not necessarily a surprise due to his ill health but i its always shocking when it actually happens i have known the family since i was little and it was pretty difficult for me to take my friend still lives with his mother and every time we speak he always mentions how its the little things that really hurt  he used to call with his father when he had troubles at work he used to go home each day and see him cooking dinner its tough to know what to say because often the person is still coming to terms with what happened and that can be a very sad and confusing thing to deal with but as many others have stated just be there whether thats in person or on the other end of the phone and just listen you dont have to say anything really be there though its not enough to say you will and then not follow through be there when they want to just sit be there when they want to cry be there when they are feeling optimistic and want to go out and do something to get their mind off things you dont have to say anything just being there is sometimes all you can do  i know this question is old from the ops perspective but this is what ive done and having been on both sides not my mother thankfully this is how i want people to react to me438k views · view upvoters quora user answered jul 10 2017 · author has 239 answers and 173k answer views my mom died a few months ago honestly i know people mean well when they say “i’m sorry for your loss” but it doesn’t really register with someone who is in shock from their mom dying instead i would just offer to be there if they need anything or if they ever need to talk my best friend called be during her ten minute break in an 11 hour shift to see if i was ok i would avoid telling them their parent is in a better place unless you know for sure it will comfort them i would also avoid using religion if they are an atheist my friend knew i was and atheist so he just said “i am keeping you in my thoughts” rather than “i am keeping you in my thoughts and prayers” the best thing you could probably say is to offer to be there if they ever need to talk or if they ever need anything sometimes you just need to vent or figure things out and it helps if another person is there78k views · view upvoters dushka zapata social introvert lets

mother passed away unexpectedly a few weeks back and she hasn’t returned to school yet she says she will come back next week we talk over the internet and when she comes back i have the slightest of ideas how to be there as a good and reliable friend i guess you would have to when the topic is brought up get along through it and tell her that you are sorry for her loss that’s what i would do tell her you are there to help whenever she needs it and that you have a shoulder for her to cry on nothing too complicated so that it won’t bring up too much of vivid memories for her just in general speaking tell her that if she’s stressed out over something indirectly about her mother’s death you will be there at all times28k views · view upvoters priyanka sharma read write click eat sleep
