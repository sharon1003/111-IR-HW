the flutter kick swimming technique and common mistakes this article describes the technique of the flutter kick in the front crawl stroke it also covers common mistakes kicking rhythms and some tips to improve your technique to get started let’s have a look at a video that shows the freestyle kick in action during the men’s 1500 final at the 2004 olympics freestyle swimming  2004 olympics your

flutter kick is a simple and efficient kick used while swimming freestyle basically both legs are kept parallel and quickly flutter up and down with toes pointed flutter kick roles the first role of the flutter kick is to provide propulsion it is a fact that world class swimmers have a powerful kick so it is clear that the kick has its importance in fast swimming however it might be less than you think in fact studies have shown that the amount of propulsion provided by the kick in elite swimmers is only about 10 the rest of propulsion is provided by the arm stroke the second role of the flutter kick is to stabilize the body in fact the start of the propulsive phase of the arm stroke always coincides with a downward motion of the leg on the same side swimming technique let’s now cover the flutter kick technique in more detail the legs are kept parallel at all times and execute opposite movements while one leg kicks downward the other one moves upward and vice versa during the first half of the downbeat the downward movement is initiated by slightly flexing the leg at the hip shortly after the knee also bends a little bit the foot goes in plantar flexion toes pointed both by muscle contraction and by the pressure of the water against the foot as it moves downward during that phase the top of the foot is oriented downward and a little bit backward because of this while the foot moves down some water is in fact pushed back that’s how propulsion is generated in the flutter kick during the second half of the downbeat the hip is locked in place while the knee is extended the toes are still pointed this phase isn’t propulsive but prepares the leg for its upward movement the upbeat movement of the leg starts while the knee is still extending in fact while the leg moves upward the pressure of the water against the lower leg will extend it the pressure of the water against the bottom of the foot will also move it in an intermediary neutral position this phase of the flutter kick isn’t propulsive either there are two popular kicking rhythms in the freestyle stroke the twobeat kick and the sixbeat kick twobeat kick in the twobeat kick you kick once with each leg per stroke cycle the downbeat of the right leg occurs during the propulsive phase of the right arm stroke insweep and upsweep to be precise freestyle twobeat kick your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  018the twobeat rhythm is used by lots of middle and long distance swimmers because it uses less energy than the sixbeat kick sixbeat kick in the sixbeat kick each leg kicks three times per stroke cycle let’s consider the movements of the right arm and the right leg the first downbeat of the leg occurs during the forward extension of the arm the second downbeat of the leg occurs during the upsweep of the arm the third downbeat of the leg occurs during the recovery of the arm the left leg moves in opposition to the right leg ian thorpe underwater your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  018the sixbeat kick is nearly always used by shortdistance swimmers but is also popular with middle distance swimmers and long distance swimmers but with a somewhat subdued kick common mistakes there are a few common mistakes in the flutter kick that decrease it’s efficiency and hence should be avoided large kick to keep drag to a minimum the kick should stay within the hole opened in the water by the head and trunk while moving forward ideally the kick should neither break the water surface nor move below the line of the body bicycle kick during the downbeat the kick is initiated by slightly flexing the hip and then the knee follows suit also only bending a little bit if you do bend the knee too much the back of your lower leg will in fact move forward rather than upward water will then be pushed forward and slow you down putting too much force in the kick during the upbeat in the freestyle stroke the upbeat phase of the kick isn’t propulsive so ideally you should relax your leg during the upbeat to save energy bending your knee and pointing your toes during the upbeat these two mistakes are closely related to the previous one if you put too much force into the kick during the upbeat you’ll also have the tendency to bend your knee and point your toes which wastes energy and increases drag ideally you should relax your leg so that the water pressure will extend it during the upbeat some tips if you have stiff ankles it might be that your foot is only oriented downward or even downward and forward during the first phase of the downbeat if that’s the case your kick might provide no propulsion at all or even have the tendency to move you backward rather than forward this is often the case with people that have a running background using swimming fins andor stretching regularly can improve the flexibility of your ankles we have swimming exercises to learn how to flutter kick and balance in a prone position an

wonderful explanations and work that you are doing with your website very very helpfulreply christophe on august 10 2013 at 1923good question it’s during the recovery for example have a look at the following videohttpwwwyoutubecomwatchv6w532cqjb xyreply naveen paudel on july 17 2014 at 1105i’m learning swimming i mostly do the 2 beat flutter kick whenever i try the 6 beat flutter kick i get confused and can’t synchronize hand and leg motions completing 3 leg cycles while doing 1 hand cycle is proving to be a bit hard to me… are there any drills to solve these problems reply christophe on july 23 2014 at 0905hi naveeni wouldn’t be too concerned about the sixbeat kick just be patient once the other aspects of your stroke are firm in place and working well together the sixbeat kick will come to you naturally just think kicking harder and faster when you want to swim fast and there will be an “aha” moment where your body will do the right thing and the sixbeat kick will occur naturally reply mboniseni simelane on november 6 2015 at 0750i struggle with floating and every time i try to float i sink it is worth noting that i am only 3 days into swimming i did never swim before how can i float without sinking reply christophe on november 9 2015 at 0905hiit is difficult to say what causes your sinking without seeing you nevertheless i’d recommend that you practice the exercises described in httpwwwenjoyswimmingcombasicswimmingtechniqueshtml good luck reply hiilz on december 12 2015 at 0844hii am not a swimming expert or anything but i read that the positioning of your body especially at the waist area is what makes you sink or float and also swimming while facing the wall infront of you you should face down or slightly forward if you can’t face down hope this helps replybindu on april 19 2016 at 1321hi i am a beginner in dogpaddle as soon as i keep my face above the water level i am unable to kick with my legs how can i improve this reply christophe on april 19 2016 at 2108hi binduit is difficult to give advice with your description why are you unable to kick with your legs as soon as you keep your face above the water surface reply eduardo alcantara martíenz on april 26 2016 at 0118on the 1959 panamerican games held in chicago george breen used the two kicks in the 1500 freestyle event it was an interesting way to swim those 1500 hundred meters after that it was common to see swimmers on that distance 1500 using that twobeat kick reply soph on april 26 2016 at 1714hi i am currently learning swimming on my own and i encountered few issues i hope you can help me1 i can now float on my back and front right now i can do freestyle but only with arm movements i have hard time doing side breathing it seems i cannot rotate my body to the side or i just have bad timing i know i have to exhale underwater and to breathe every 3 strokes but i just can’t do it it’s frustrating i have to stop just to breathe do you have any suggestions to correct this2 also i am curious how can other people swim with their heads up i tried doing the same lifting my shoulder and head up but nothing happens i’m still underwater i also can’t lift my head up to breathe while doing front float how do they do that3 as for breaststroke do i lift my upper back or just head to breathe after i breathe i sink so low in the water do you have any tips4 i also tried doing sculling and eggbeater kick but failed i tried doing sculling while doing back float but nothing happens as for eggbeater kick i just go backwards do you have any idea why please help me i really appreciate your help thank youreply christophe on april 26 2016 at 2226hi soph1 i’d suggest you practice the sequence of drills in the “learn the freestyle stroke” section of this website you’ll learn horizontal balance body rotation and breathing on your side in those drills2 do you mean lifting your head forward while swimming front crawl to see above the water surface if that’s the case you need to push both down and backwards at the beginning of the underwater arm stroke but it requires good coordination and technique also when i do this i only lift my head up so as that my eyes are above the water surface my mouth stays below the water surface i still breathe on the side if you lift your head in front float to breathe you lower body will sink so you need to inhale quickly and then quickly release your upper body in the water so that your lower body floats up again3 to breathe in breaststroke you should keep your head in line with your torso your head shoulders and upper chest should rise above the water surface as a unit as you breathe and then drop back into the water4 i’m sorry i have to admit that i never learned to do the eggbeater kick i wanted to learn it a few years ago but had to stop because of knee problems reply soph on april 27 2016 at 20001 okay thanks for your suggestion i’ll take a look at it2 yes actually not just front crawl i also saw others doing it with head up breaststroke and also when doing front float they push water down to breathe i can’t do any of that i just can’t lift my head well i can but just less than a second is that really like that there’s not enough time for me to breathe i take a deep breath then exhales while entering water until going up for air is this wrong“i only lift my head up so as that my eyes are above the water surface my mouth stays below the water surface i still breathe on the side”i thought doing this makes breathing easier but it seems it’s just the same as normal freestyle right3 is it possible to breathe in 1 sec it seems the major problem for me is breathing i have no idea how to fix this i hope you can explain more in detail on how much you breathe in and out maybe using percentage or something you prefer thank youreply christopheon april 29 2016 at 2158hi soph2 breathing in breaststroke and front float is more a matter of bending your knees so that your legs drop and your body pivots around the hips then you head shoulder and chest will move up and you can breathe in front crawl you normally breathe on the side i thought you were refering to the case where you are swimming front crawl and want to look forward for example in triathlon races3 i think in freestyle i take less than one second to inhale in breaststroke it could be two seconds the important thing to know is that you must exhale underwater then it’s possible to quickly inhale above water reply charlotte de clerck on may 15 2016 at 0619helloi’ve been learning for a month now but i still can’t do the kicking properly as i tend to kick as fast as i can without even caring bout the beat… i’ve been trying to do the 2beat kick but i keep on sinking instead of moving forward and i can’t do the breathing properly without a perfect kick… do you have any tips for this problem reply christophe on may 15 2016 at 1339i guess you are lacking horizontal balance you then need to kick hard to avoid sinking which quickly uses up your oxygen and makes it impossible to breathe properly as you get out of breath quickly please practice the sequence of drills in the freestyle sectionhttpwwwenjoyswimmingcomlearnhowtoswimhtml this will let you practice balance rotation breathing on the side coordination of the arms kicking etc take your time don’t rush the process reply chang ling on july 6 2016 at 1715it seems that whole leg movementflutter kick contributes at the best only “a little bit” to propulsion during the first half of downkick am i correct reply christophe on july 6 2016 at 2200absolutely reply chang ling on july 8 2016 at 1153why do professional swimmers not adopt the “frog kick” it can contribute significantly to propulsion  50  that can possibly overcome some negative effect on “streamline” i have tried it myself it is faster than using flutter kick i don’t know why it is not popular reply christophe on july 12 2016 at 2140hi changthe frog kick creates tremendous propulsion during the active phase but also a lot of drag during the recovery which on average is less effective than the flutter kick reply tori on september 10 2016 at 2154hi i want to thank you guys for your kind efforts in teaching us the techniques of swimming i studied this page thoroughly i did not know how to flutter kick at all it took me like 10 sessions to get the idea of what had to be done with the legs but i got it at last and thanks to lots of practice i am now flutter kicking like a steam boat in fact i am now swimming the crawl god bless you reply christophe on september 16 2016 at 1902thanks torireply micael on october 22 2016 at 0543when i swim i kick to much and i think is because of that i get too tired i make small little fast kicks i want to kick slower someone told me to train my stroke with a pull boy in the legs is this correct reply christophe on october 24 2016 at 2237this most likely is a balance problem you are using the kick to keep your legs up instead of using them for propulsion and that’s why you get tired as you suspected our swimming drills take care of this and teach you how to use balance to keep your legs up the following drill is especially interesting to get rid this problem httpwwwenjoyswimmingcomfreestyleswimmingdrillsbalancingonyourfronthtml reply adnan on november 3 2016 at 1319hii am learning swimming while doing forward crawling i can do decent kicks i can do very fast or normal also but the problem comes with freestyle i don’t know but the moment i move my first hand the legs will stop moving at all i can still swim and complete the distance but it becomes a struggle by the end also when i breathe the body goes down a bit and if i am not able to do the kicking then it doesn’t come up i am getting very desperate with it… at times i try too hard but they get so stiff then… sometimes i launch myself just focusing on legs and ensure that no matter what i will keep kicking and that time the kicks will start vibrating so i am really finding it very hard to get the hand and kick coordination also every day when i go to the pool i try motivating myself that today it will happen but that’s not happening at all i really need your advice and some tips drills which will should help me with this thanks and regardsadnan reply christophe on november 5 2016 at 1519hi adnani suggest that you practice our freestyle stroke drills which should take care of the issues you mentionedhttpwwwenjoyswimmingcomlearnhowtoswimhtml good luck reply saleel e on february 25 2017 at 0607thank you very much for the highly informative website i am 54 year old male i am not fatty and been learning swimming since the last 20 days my problem is with kicking my legs always goes down after a few kicks if i am getting a slight support under my hips i am able to kick efficiently i am quiet confident that if i can correct this hip sinking issue i can swim smooth please help reply christophe on february 26 2017 at 0952hi saleelthe following drill took care of this issue for me foreverhttpwwwenjoyswimmingcomfreestyleswimmingdrillsbalancingonyourfronthtml once you get how sinking legs are related to an incorrect upper body position and you learn how to fix it sinking legs should be a thing of the past reply dan on april 26 2017 at 1821hi christophethanks for the great article i have a problem with kicking too much out of the water on both backstroke and freestyle would be very grateful for any tips  alterations i can make to improve this dan reply christophe on may 3 2017 at 2246hi dani think that generally doing regular kicking sets with short blade fins and a swimmer’s snorkel can help vertical kicking sets can also help in freestyle using a sixbeat kick instead of using a twobeat kick also should help reduce the kick’s amplitude finally if you have stiff ankles doing some ankle stretching exercises on a regular basis without overdoing it please don’t injure yourself should increase the efficiency of your kick and hence decrease the need for a wide ample kick by the way doing kicking sets with short blade fins also helps improve ankle flexibility hope this helpschristophe reply alexey filippov on june 13 2017 at 2104is this statement in “swim stroke phases” section correct synchronization between arms and legs the timing between arm stroke and leg kick is also very precise whether you use a two beat kick or a six beat kick the downsweep of the propulsive arm and the downbeat of the leg on the same side always starts simultaneously reply brent on july 4 2017 at 1902hi i am new to lap swimming i am struggling to make progress because i have to stop after each length of the pool to catch my breath i am in decent shape overall so this is more of a swimming problem than a general fitness issue this makes it very difficult to improve my stroke because i am so focused on trying to side breath that i can’t focus very much on my mechanics and because my mechanics are not great i have to expend a lot of extra energy which makes breathing that much harder would you recommend using a snorkel at first so i can focus on my stroke then once i have improved and built some stamina add side breathing as the “finishing touch” in other words do you think it is a good idea to isolate the breathing from the stroke itself at first any feedback would be appreciated thanks reply christophe on july 5 2017 at 0903hi brentthis is a common problem because you need to do a lot of things simultaneously while swimming front crawl a snorkel can certainly help you to concentrate on your arm and leg movements without having to bother with breathing and so is a nice tool to have in your bag however to get really comfortable in the water you need to be able to balance your body in a horizontal position and you also need to be able to roll from the side onto your stomach and back on the side effortlessly once you can float on the side and stay balanced breathing rally becomes a nonissue and everything else becomes a lot easier the best way to learn this is to follow the drill progression in the “learn the freestyle stroke” section of this site httpwwwenjoyswimmingcomlearnhowtoswimhtml it will take a few weeks to go through these drills but you will save yourself a lot of hassle and struggle on the long run if you go through those exercises good luckreply aimon s on july 16 2017 at 2202this is actually a great site for info and tips thanks i was forced to start swimming 6 months ago when i had a spine op slowly warming up to it haha i feel like my form is decent lower body stays up ankles are pretty flexible etc but i noticed my leg propulsion is still pretty terrible when i look at other swimmers i try a few one hundred meter kickboard drills and using fins but don’t seem to be getting faster it literally takes me a whole minute for 25 meters with the kickboard any advice my overall swim speed has improved but it seems to be all arm propulsion thanks reply christophe on july 24 2017 at 2305well i have to tell you a secret i suck at kickboard kicking too ha ha i rarely do kicking laps with a kickboard when i want to work out my legs i prefer to put on a swim snorkel and extend my arms forward and then i can kick very hard and also get all the air that i need to do several laps but i also prefer to work on my technique rather than to do kicking sets for my legs so i don’t do them that often i also have observed that girls often have an easier time doing kicking sets with a kickboard they seems to have a different balance in the water than men replynikki on september 1 2017 at 2240hii’ve been on a swim team for about 4 years and i’ve always had trouble with the flutter kick it always causes pain in my knees and no matter how fast i kick or how hard i try i don’t seem to be going anywhere when using kick board when i talk about my knees hurting people tell me to use my hips and not just bent my knees but they still hurt when i do that i feel like there is something i could do to kick faster and with less pain but nothing works please helpreply christophe on september 3 2017 at 2040hi nikkii’d really recommend you see a physician or physical therapist your knees shouldn’t hurt while flutter kicking don’t ruin your kneesin addition some people are good kickers and some are weak kickers anyway there are no kickboard kicking competitions so being weak kicking a kickboard doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be a weak swimmer but please get your knees checked out reply londiwe on january 30 2018 at 1901hi chris thank you for the effort in writing such articles you are a lifesaver i began my first lesson for the 1st time ever yesterday and the next is tomorrow… that is i will be practicing 2 days per week for an hour i am glad to know that i can float kick but of course not for propulsion as yet… but reading your articles i will get there i just want to know… how long will it take for me to be a good swimmer estimated time roughly reply christophe on january 31 2018 at 2046hi londwiethanks for the kind words this is great that you are starting to take lessons and learning to swim as for your question it depends on what you call a good swimmer if you are dedicated you can make a lot of progress in a few months of time and become reasonably proficient in a few of the swim strokes good luck and have funreply submit a comment your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website notify me of followup comments by email
