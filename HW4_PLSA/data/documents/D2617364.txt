according to biblical tradition the hebrews are peoples descended from shem one of noahs sons through eber the eponymous ancestor and abraham gen 722 f reports that the flood destroyed all life except that in noahs ark consequently the whole human family descended from noah and his sons japheth ham and shem as yet not all of the names of eponymous ancestors in the family lines can be identified 1 but some probabilities are listed in chart 6 from shem through arpachshad and shelah came eber the eponymous ancestor of the hebrews and from his descendants through peleg reu sereg and nahor came terah the father of abram and his brothers nahor and haran it becomes clear that if hebrews are descendants of eber then others besides those of abrahams line would be included see gen 102527 read gen 1225 with abraham the story of the hebrews begins and it is clearly stated that hebrew origins lay outside canaan the summons to leave his ancestral home and journey to canaan is accompanied by a promise gen 122 that becomes a submotif in patriarchal accounts reappearing again and again cf gen 1314 f 155 f 1810 2217 2624 2813 f 3212 f 359 ff 4816 finally taking covenantal form gen 1714 ff the promise has two parts nationhood and divine blessing or protection the precise location of the nationtobe is not specified but was of course known to those hearing or reading the account the promise of blessing signified the unique and particularistic bond between yahweh and his followers so that the enemies of abraham or the nation were enemies of yahweh and those befriending abraham andor the nation would be blessed with this assurance abraham journeyed to canaan egypt the negeb hebron gezer beersheba and back to hebron where he and his wife sarah died the descriptions of abraham are not uniform at times he appears as a lonely migrant at others as a chieftain head of a large family or as a warrior factual details about the patriarch are difficult to establish for his real significance lies in what is often called inner history through which those who looked to abraham as a forefather gained understanding of themselves as people of the promise and attained a sense of destiny and an appreciation of their particular relationship to their deity we have noted earlier that some abrahamic traditions coincide with information coming from nuzi which would place abraham in the middle bronze era we read that abraham in response to a divine summons left mesopotamia and journeyed to canaan with his wife sarah and nephew lot it is clear that the people were meant to recognize themselves as a community originating in a commission from god and in the unwavering unquestioning obedience of abraham the journey itself was more than a pilgrimage for it constituted the starting point of a continuing adventure in nationhood nor are the travelers without vicissitudes but throughout famine earthquake fire and war they are protected by yahweh gen 14 in which abraham is called a hebrew for the first time records a battle between the patriarch and kings of countries or areas as yet unidentified for certain and associates him with the canaanite king of jerusalem it is possible that reliable historical data are preserved here 2 the account of the destruction of sodom and gomorrah may also rest in some memory of a shift in the earths crust that destroyed the cities of the plain tradition associates abraham with hebron and if jebel errumeide is the site of this ancient city it is evident that a powerful city was located here in the middle bronze period 3abrahams adventures in the negeb the problems of grazing and watering rights and the digging of a well at beersheba 4 echo genuine problems of the shepherd the episode involving sarah and king abimelech a doublet of gen 1210 ff introduces sarahs relationship to abraham as both wife and sister a relationship which in hurrian society provided the wife with privileged social standing it may also be interpreted as an historic link with the cultures of the upper euphrates 5the close relationship between the hebrews and the people of the desert and steppes is recognized in the story of ishmael the nomadic first son of abraham but it is through isaac the second son about whom so very little is recorded that the hebrews trace their own family line both isaac and his son jacob maintain a separateness from the people among whom they dwell taking wives from among their own kin in haran gen 24 28 the story of jacob who becomes israel and his twin brother esau who becomes edom is colored with rivalry trickery and bitter misundertanding but also contains echoes of hurrian custom in hurrian law birthright could be purchased and some of the terminology associated with isaacs blessing of his sons reflects hurrian patterns 6the stories about jacob also accord with nuzi hurrian law for it is recorded that a man may labor for his wife 7 in dealing with his uncle laban jacobs trickery was matched by his uncles deceptive acts there is no condemnation of chicanery but rather the attitude that to best a man in a business contract revealed cleverness when jacobs hopes to inherit his uncles estate were dashed by the birth of male heirs he broke contract and fled and it was only when a new contract was made that relationships were healed the account of jacobs night wrestling with an angelic visitor has probably come down to us through various recensions for it now contains two aetiological explanations one concerning the name jacobisrael and the other giving the reason why the ischiatic sinew is not eaten by hebrews other traditions associate jacob with bethel and shechem joseph the son of jacob was sold into slavery by jealous brothers and rose to high office in egypt when his father and brothers migrated to egypt to escape famine they were regally received and encouraged to settle documents attesting to the custom of admitting nomadic groups into the country in time of famine are known from egypt and the joseph stories reflect many accurate details about egyptian life and may be derived in part from egyptian tales as we shall see the pharaoh under whom joseph rose to power is not identified it is quite possible as a alt has argued that the patriarchs were founders of separate cults or clans in which distinctive names for the deity were compounded with patriarchal names 8 hence the deity was known as the shield of abraham gen 151 the fear of isaac gen 3142 53 and the mighty one of jacob gen 4924 individual representations were later fused and equated with yahweh and individual clan heroes were placed in an historical sequence and made part of a single family line from abraham to jacob israel read exod 16 after what appears to be an extended period of time the hebrews increased in numbers and became a mighty multitude and a pharaoh who was indifferent to the joseph traditions inherited the throne and persecuted the hebrews pressing them into virtual enslavement moses a desert refugee from egyptian justice became associated with the kenite people on the slopes of mount sinai in a dramatic encounter with yahweh he was commissioned to act as deliverer of the hebrews in the clash with pharaoh the godkings power was overshadowed by yahweh through a series of horrendous events in which the nile was turned to blood and plagues involving frogs gnats flies cattle boils hail locusts and darkness are ultimately climaxed by the death of all the firstborn children of egypt read exod 711 this final act associated in tradition with the passover festival persuaded pharaoh to release the hebrews shortly after the hebrews departed pharaoh changed his mind and pursued them at the sea of reeds yahweh permitted the hebrews to pass through the waters unscathed but overwhelmed the egyptians the hebrews pressed into the wilderness to mount sinai where the law was given and there they entered a covenant with yahweh read num 1439f after an abortive attempt to seize canaan by penetrating from the south they moved eastward and after many setbacks took up a position on the eastern side of the jordan just north of the salt sea here moses died and under his successor joshua the attacks on canaan were launched problems with dates and placesefforts to date the patriarchal period have not been particularly rewarding for biblical chronology is complex in the p source 215 years pass between the time of abrahams journey to canaan and jacobs migration to egypt see gen 124b 215 2526 479 and the period spent in egypt is given as 430 years exod 1240 f making a total of 645 years before the exodus as we shall see most scholars date the exodus near the middle of the thirteenth century so that abraham would leave mesopotamia at the beginning of the nineteenth century and jacobs journey to egypt would occur about 1700 b c unfortunately date variations occur in some manuscripts in the lxx exod 1240 includes time spent in both egypt and canaan in the 430year period some manuscripts read 435 years according to this reckoning abrahams journey would fall in the seventeenth century and jacobs in the fifteenth century the early nineteenth century date for abraham places his departure from mesopotamia at the time of the elamite and amorite invasion it harmonizes with the conclusions of nelson glueck who found that between the twentyfirst and nineteenth centuries b c the negeb was dotted with hamlets where inhabitants having learned how to hoard water engaged in agriculture and tended small flocks such settlements would provide stopping places for abraham and his retinue 9 the seventeenth century date for jacobs settlement in egypt coincides with the hyksos invasion of egypt lending support to josephus hypothesis for hebrews may have been part of this movement the second pattern of dating would place abraham in the time of hammurabi of babylon and would give strength to the argument that the mention of king amraphel of shinar in gen 141 is a hebraized reference to hammurabi abraham would therefore be in canaan during the hyksos period and joseph would have risen to power in the amarna age the close of the amarna period brought to power leaders hostile to akhenaton and possibly also to those he had favored whatever the correct date for abraham may be he represents the beginning of the nation to the hebrews yahwehs promise to the patriarch and his successors is considered to be the guarantee of national existence num 3211 there are no references to abraham in the writings of the eighth century prophets for then stress was laid on the exodus as the starting point of the nation in the seventh and sixth centuries and in the postexilic period the abrahamic tradition came to the fore once again efforts to determine the date and route of the exodus have been disappointing josephus placed the exodus at the time of the overthrow of the hyksos by ahmose in the sixteenth century a date that is far too early biblical evidence is limited i kings 61 reports that solomon began building the temple in the fourth year of his reign 480 years after the exodus solomons rule is believed to have begun near the middle of the tenth century possibly about 960 bc thus the date of the exodus would be 960 minus 4 4th year of reign plus 480 or 1436 in that case thutmose iii would be the pharaoh of the oppression and his mother hatshepsut might be identified as the rescuer of the infant moses the hebrew invasion of canaan taking place forty years later or about 1400 b c might be identified with the coming of the apiru 10another theory is based on the reference to the building of pithom and raamses in exod 111 it was noted earlier that both seti i and rameses ii worked at the rebuilding of these cities and that rameses is the best candidate for the pharaoh of the exodus 12901224 b c if the exodus took place between 1265 and 1255 the invasion of canaan would occur in mernephtahs reign and some encounter between egyptians and hebrews would be the basis for his boast of annihilating israel attempts to chart the course followed by the fleeing hebrews is equally frustrating no one knows for sure the location of mount sinai and the site chosen for the holy mountain determines in part the route suggested attempts have been made to identify stopping places mentioned in num 33137 11 but the identifications can be no more than conjectures for biblical descriptions are vague without distinctive landmarks 12the traditional site of sinai jebel musa near the southern tip of the sinai peninsula has been widely accepted since the fourth and fifth centuries a d although there was some confusion over which mountain in the cluster of peaks was sinai the traditional route to jebel musa begins in egypt crosses the sea of reeds identified either at the tip of the red sea in the gulf of heroonpolis gulf of suez or as one of the papyrus swamps above the gulf and goes southward along the western edge of the sinai peninsula before turning inland to jebel musa from sinai the hebrews would move to the north along the gulf of aqabah toward ezion geber and kadesti barnea sinai has also been identified as jebel helal located in the northern part of the peninsula the route to this mountain goes from egypt across the marshy swamp area and follows the way of shur one of the major trade routes of the ancient world to jebel helal and kadesh barnea another route to this same mountain goes over the land strip of lake sirbonis which becomes the sea of reeds northward along the way of the philistines the coastal route then southward to kadesh barnea and jebel helal some have insisted that the descriptions in exod 1916 suggest volcanic disturbances and that sinai must be sought among volcanic mountains probably those in the midianite areas on the eastern side of the gulf of aqabah one choice among these mountains is el khrob which preserves the name horeb the exodus route would then follow the way of shur to kadesh barnea and ezion geber and down the coast to el khrob sinai has also been located in edomite territory for judg 54 and deut 332 locate the mountain in seir jebel faran on the west side of the wadi arabah has been suggested as a possible choice and mountains in the petra area have also been suggested in this case the hebrews would have traveled along the way of shur by way of ezion geber into edomite territory 13although for the scholar there are innumerable problems associated with the exodus tradition this memorable event became a central factor in the interpretation of the hebrew faith here yahweh had demonstrated his loyal redeeming love to the people whom he had chosen as his own in the darkest days of the exilic period the memory of the exodus event became a source of hope for it was believed that yahweh would deliver his people from bondage in babylon even as he had rescued them from egypt a somewhat different tradition of hebrew beginnings is reflected in ezek 163 ff  where mixed ancestry — amorite hittite and canaanite — is attributed to the jerusalemites but here we have a unique situation for jerusalem was a jebusite stronghold which did not become a hebrew city until the time of david ii sam 5 the firstfruits liturgy deut 265 traces hebrew ancestry to the aramaeans but the designation appears to be used in a broad rather than a specific sense etymological analyses of the term hebrew  ibri have given little help to the study of origins the term has been related to a root meaning to go over or to go across hence a hebrew would be one who crossed over or one who went from place to place a nomad a wanderer a designation that would fit some aspects of patriarchal behavior a similar term habiru is found in cuneiform documents from the twentieth to the eleventh centuries often used interchangeably with another word sa gaz at times the habiru appear to be settled in specific locations at times they serve in the army as mercenaries or are bound to masters as servants the el amarna tablets refer to invaders of palestine as apiru a word bearing close relationship to the terms habiru and hebrew 14 extensive research has led many scholars to the conclusion that the term hebrew was first used as an appellative to describe foreigners who crossed into settled areas and referred not to a specific group but to a social caste if the word hebrew parallels habiru or apiru we know that these people on occasion were employed at times created settlements of their own and at other times attacked established communities the suggestion that the terms apiru habiru and hebrew relate to those who have renounced a relationship to an existing society who have by a deliberate action withdrawn from some organization or rejected some authority and who have become through this action freebooters slaves employees or mercenaries presents real possibilities 15 in the bible the word hebrew becomes an ethnic term used interchangeably with israelite 16perhaps the best that can be said is that the hebrews of the bible appear to be one branch of the northwest semitic group related linguistically to canaanites edomites and moabites who moved from a seminomadic existence to settled life in the bronze age it is clear from biblical tradition that at the beginning of their history the seminomadic hebrews with flocks of sheep and goats were at the point of moving into a settled way of life the patriarchs are chiefs of large families or clans living for the most part in peace among their neighbors with whom they enter covenants from family and clan beginnings came tribes linked to one another by ancestral blood ties bonds between clans or tribes were so strong that the group might be described as having an existence of its own a personality embodying the corporate membership this phenomenon of psychic unity labeled corporate personality by h wheeler robinson 17 placed particular responsibilities upon each member of the group because group life was a unity injury to a single member was injury to all demanding repayment by the next of kin the goel 18 blood shed was tribal blood requiring redemption by the next of kin should a man die without offspring his next of kin had to bring the widow to fruition and the child born to her became the child of the dead man the one carrying his name ruth 4410 as the father was at the head of the family so the tribal chief and elders led the larger group seeking the wellbeing peace and psychic health of the members the corporate nature of the group afforded great protection for wherever a member went he was backed by the strength of the tribe to which he belonged fear of reprisal tended to be — but was not always — a restraining factor in violation of social mores judg 1920 when the head of the household died the widow and orphan were cared for by the next of kin and ultimately by the total group tribal and family religion centered in holy places where a local priesthood tended shrines kept altar fires burning and shared in offerings i sam 21217 the father seems to have acted as ministrant on behalf of the family i sam 1 offerings were made and a meal shared through which the participants were bound more firmly together there is no evidence that the deity was believed to participate in the meal agreements made at holy places were witnessed by the deity who guaranteed fulfillment of terms gen 3151 ff the shrine of baalberith judg 94 or elberith judg 946 the covenant god at shechem may have been a holy place where covenants were made in the presence of the god an important custom in hebrew society was the practice of hospitality a guest was honored and entertained even at considerable expense to the host gen 1818 242832 once under the hosts roof or having shared food the guest was guaranteed protection gen 19 judg 19 should a stranger settle in the community he enjoyed most of the rights and responsibilities from time to time new groups were grafted into the family tree of hebrew tribes and the heritage of the larger group became that of the adopted ones as when the calebites united with the tribe of judah josh 14615 1513 when confronted by common problems or enemies tribal federations were formed see judg 45 on the other hand when a famine or food shortage occurred one group might leave to seek new territory gen 13 tribal activity in canaan is portrayed as a twelvetribe federation 19 often called an amphictyony after greek tribal federations 20 however clear distinctions between greek and hebrew patterns must be recognized greek cities united in an amphictyony centered about a shrine where peoples from the surrounding cities worshiped and where decisions affecting the participating members were made the hebrew amphictyony was centered in the ark of yahweh a moveable shrine some scholars have argued that a primitive amphictyonic ritual was observed at the shrine at sliechem 21 but the hypothesis rests only upon probabilities a sixtribe federation which preceded the twelvetribe grouping has also been postulated
