her he had previously moved from seattle to oak harbor washington 13 before his death pinyan was building a new house and a barn in which he planned to place a horse on the key peninsula highway in gig harbor washington he was about to begin making payments on his 30year 144000 mortgage on it 2pinyan previously lost the ability to experience certain sensations after suffering from a motorcycle accident and became involved in increasingly extreme sexual acts such as extremely large dildos fisting and sex with horses he was a part of a group of men who received anal sex from horses and sometimes had sex with one another afterwards in 2015 charles mudede of the stranger wrote that the men had a sexual fixation on large penises that may have had nothing to do with horses 1 he also believed pinyan did not truly love horses and was not a true zoophile 1death  editthe incident occurred at a 40acre 16 ha farm 14 located in an unincorporated area in king county washington 15 northwest of the city of enumclaw 14 pinyan and a man named james michael tait who lived in a trailer next to the farm plus another unidentified man often visited the farm to engage in sexual intercourse with the horses inside 2prosecutors later determined that the horse had not been injured by being forced to engage in sex in this manner 15 16 according to the medical examiners office pinyan died of acute peritonitis due to perforation of the colon  14 and the death was ruled accidental 17he was anonymously dropped off at the enumclaw community hospital 14 18 on july 2 2005 a man asked hospital staff for medical assistance for his companion pinyan was found dead in the emergency room aged 45 the man who brought pinyan into the hospital had disappeared by the time hospital staff came to contact him 14media reports at the time of the trial suggested that despite seizing and examining carefully a large number of such videos from the property no evidence of injury to the horses was found precluding animal cruelty charges and that the trespass charge against tait were brought due to lack of grounds for any other matter it was only after pinyan died when law enforcement looked for one way to punish his associates that the legality of bestiality in washington state became an issue  the prosecutors office wanted to charge tait with animal abuse but the police found no evidence of abused animals on the many videotapes they collected from his home as there was no law against humanely having sex with one horse the prosecutors could only charge tait with trespassing— charles mudede the stranger 2the prosecutors office says no animal cruelty charges were filed because there was no evidence of injury to the horses— associated press at the seattle times 19investigation  editafter pinyan died the authorities used his drivers license to find acquaintances and relatives earlier news reports stated that the authorities had used surveillance camera footage to track down pinyans companion using the contacts the authorities found the farm where the incident occurred 14 the police tracked down the rural enumclaw area farm which was known in zoophile internet chat rooms as a destination for people who want to have sex with livestock and seized hundreds of hours of videotapes of men engaging in receptive anal sex with horses one of the videotapes featured kenneth pinyan shortly before he died on july 2 14media reporting  editjennifer sullivan a seattle times staff reporter said that originally the king county sheriffs department did not expect the newspaper to report on the event because it was too gruesome after an associated press report stated that the farm where the event occurred attracted a significant number of people who wanted to partake in bestiality the seattle times decided that it needed to write articles about the case since multiple people were involved 20a video of pinyan engaging in sexual acts with a horse circulated around the internet after pinyans death where he gained notoriety and the infamous name of mr hands 1 21criminal charges guilty plea and sentencing  editthe photographer 54yearold james michael tait 15 was charged with criminal trespassing in the first degree because the owners of the farm a third party were not aware that the men entered the property to engage in bestiality the third man was not charged since he was not visible in the videos seized by investigators 2 on november 29 2005 tait entered an alford plea 22 and judge david christie gave him a suspended oneyear sentence a 300 fine and one day of community service judge christie ordered tait to never visit the farm again 2aftermath  editafter pinyan died 2 pam roach a member of the washington state senate and a republican from auburn crafted a bill that would ban bestiality in washington state 20 senate bill 6417 which made bestiality a class c felony passed on february 11 2006 with all 36 state senators voting for it bestiality had been legal in washington state since 1976 it was incorporated in washingtons sodomy criminal statute rcw 979100 and repealed by the state legislature in 1975 mudede wrote it was an almost comically easy law to pass 2 bestiality had no political support in washington state and no group in washington state advocated for bestiality 2 the law is rcw 1652205 3 mudede wrote that reading rcw 1652205 is very much like reading hardcore porn 2 in addition the law prohibits videotap ing a person engaged in a sexual act or sexual contact with an animal either alive or dead because of the provision against videotaping mudede stated that the law points an angry finger directly at james tait 2in 2009 tait and two other people were jailed in maury county tennessee accused of engaging in bestiality 23 the specific charge was three counts of felony animal cruelty 24 in january 2010 tait pleaded guilty in a tennessee court to engaging in sexual acts with animals and he was placed on probation 25 in 2015 mudede said that he was unaware of any bestiality arrests in washington state since the pinyan incident 26mudede wrote that at the time of the incident the residents of enumclaw were shocked and angered by the incident in 2015 ten years after the incident mudede wrote that enumclaw residents were unwilling to acknowledge the incident 13over a decade after the
