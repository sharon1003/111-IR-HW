monster engines of world war iiposted on december 20 2011 by deditor by norm goyer this reno racer super corsair has the pratt  whitney 28 cylinder four row 4360 ci radial engine installed world war ii was responsible for the birth of both the rocket powered aircraft icbms and the jet engine it also sounded the death knoll of the piston engine to power military and airline aircraft of the future germany pioneered the jet rocket and pulse jet engines with their v1 pulse jet me163 komet which was rocket powered and the v2 which was rocket powered intercontinental missile the me 262 used two jet engines for power other countries were working on these projects but it was germany who advanced them the furthest the four row radial has each offset a few inches so cooling air can reach all cylinders but at that time none were suitable for powering long range bombers and troop transports the four engine bomber with its fighter escort was the winning formula available engine sizes were the dominating factor in these aircraft designs and missions it is interesting to note than the single engine vietnam era douglas ad1 was capable of carrying more bombs than a b17 of only a few years earlier due to lack of suitable engines the aircraft designers had to add engines to carry a larger load germany had troop carriers and glider tugs which were powered with six engines the designers kept on demanding larger and larger engines but all designs had limiting factors two companies did manage to build some very large engines during the war pratt  whitney designed and built their r4360 wasp major four bank radial engine which was air cooled this engine had four seven cylinder radial engines bolted together back to front each offset a few degrees to allow air to flow between the rows for cooling the engine was a nightmare to maintain but quite reliable when powering aircraft the huge “corn cop” engine powered these aircraft very successfully b50 superfortress c97 stratofreighter c119 flying boxcar convair b36 and the hughes h4 hercules spruce goosethe napier sabre engine is an h configuration with four inline six cylinder engines stacked this engine is liquid cooled the english napier engine was a horsepower of a different color however this 24 cylinder engine was essentially four inline six cylinder sleeve valve engines bolted together with two on the bottom with two more laying on top of the bottom two this configuration is referred to as an “h” engine this engine ended up being the most powerful reciprocating engine used in world war ii the designer had to use sleeve valves in place of poppet valves in order to get sufficient fuel into the head chamber and for the exhaust to evacuate the cylinder before the next fuel charge was admitted a sleeve valve has holes in the side of the cylinder for both fuel and exhaust the sleeve moves up and down over the cylinder opening and closing the intakes and exhaust ports if my memory serves me an early willy’s car used a sleeve valve engine the designers of the napier engine first attempted to air cool it but had to liquid cool for proper temperature control earlier versions of this engine were used successfully in some english schneider cup trophy racers during the world war ii this engine was used in the hawker typhoon and tempest these engines did not take too well to supercharging due to poor fuel quality but they excelled at low altitude high speed missions both the tempest and typhoon were the most feared aircraft by german fw 190 pilots it was very fast and deadly with its firepower during the battle of britain it was the typhoon and the tempest that were able to knock the v1 buzz bomb out of the sky pilots found out that you had more chance to knocking them down not by shooting at them but by flying alongside them and tipping them over with your wing tip this would cause the controlling gyros to spin out of sync and the v1 would auger into the ground this was where the two hawker fighters excelled they were fast enough to catch them and knock them down this engine was the most powerful of wwii it powered the hawker typhoon and tempest another interesting fact about the napier engine was the quality control problems with its production the test engines were literally handmade and assembled by engineers while the production engines were assembled by production workers in an assembly line atmosphere it took several years and a new company owner to finally solve the poor quality work when the war was over napier dropped all future development work on the h engine and
