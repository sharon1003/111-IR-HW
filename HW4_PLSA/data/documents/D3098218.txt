introduction to hebrew participles hebrew participles are verbal adjectives meaning that they function like adjectives though they are constructed from verbs participles use the same endings you have learned for nouns and adjectives so learning their inflections is easy hebrew participles have the following properties gender masculine or femininenumber singular or pluraldefiniteness article or no articlevoice active or passive the active voice indicates that the subject is the doer of the action john hits the ball john acts namely by hitting the ball the passive voice indicates that the subject is acted upon by the verb john was hit by the ball john is acted uponnotice that in english the voice of the verb changes the form of the verb hits  was hit the same sort of thing happens in hebrew where you will see spelling changes for passive voice participles in biblical hebrew most participles you will encounter are qal active participles the simple or base form of a hebrew verb is referred to as qal light passive participles are relatively less used 1 active participles like adjectives participles must agree with the noun they modify in gender and number and therefore can take four possible forms two for masculine nouns singular and plural and two for feminine nouns singular and plural these forms are changed by means of adding endings to the stem of the word in the same manner as endings are attached to nouns the basic pattern for the active participle is as follows notice that these are the same endings you studied for nouns and adjectives what is different however is the schema showing xxx with a characteristic vowel pattern these xs refer to the root letters of a given verb and the cholem vav after the second letter is the characteristic sign of the qal active participle note that the cholem often appears instead of the cholem vav in the pattern and this is known as defective spelling an example should make this clear the vowel pattern for the root letters can vary depending on the class of verb strong or weak being inflected for instance the pattern for shamar to guard is as folllows there may be slight variations in spelling that you will see with participle forms of verbs but the cholem or cholem vav between the first and second root letters remains constant throughout the inflections additional examples in this example the root letters are lamed mem and dalet notice how the participles are inflected according to gender and number in this example the root letters are hey lamed and dalet again notice how the vowel pattern applies to these root letters to form the active participle forms notice that in this example the feminine singular fs ending is hey rather than tav this is fairly common but note that the cholem remains constant throughout the inflections in the example above the third letter of the root is ayin a guttural letter this is known as a weak verb and vowel changes occur as a result iiiguttural type verbs prefer a furtive patach under the last letter you will also see this pattern with the verb yadah to know in the examples above notice that the third letter of the root is a hey a guttural letter verbs with a third root letter that is hey iiihey drop out before endings are added and vowel changes result this is something you will just have to memorize however notice again that the characteristic cholem vav remains between the first two root letters throughout the inflections in short you will need to be able to recognize the qal active participle form for a verb when you are reading from the tanakh often this is not as difficult as it may seem since the form of the word you see in the text will indicate nounadjective ending on a verb in cases where you are unsure you will need to resort to your lexicon to confirm the morphology of the word in question uses of the participle participles may be used in the following ways as an adjective a loving man agrees with noun in gender number definiteness as a substantive  the one who loves is good stands alone as a verb the man loves the woman subject normally precedes the participle adjectival usage when a participle is used as an adjective it will modify a noun or pronoun with which it agrees in gender number and definiteness these are the same rules as other hebrew adjectives examples in the example above notice that the participle follows the noun and agrees in gender number and definiteness we would translate this as a sitting man or a man who is sitting in this example notice that the participle follows the noun and agrees in gender number and definiteness we would translate the sitting woman or the woman who is sitting substantival usage when a participle is used as a substantive it will act like a noun note that participles can also function in word pairs so they can take the characteristic construct form endings you will see on nouns here the masculine singular participle stands in construct relation to the noun shalom we would translate this a guarder of peace often participles will function as a noun meaning the one s who verbal usage a participle can also function as a verb in a clause when so used the participle will not agree with a noun in definiteness nor will it take the article present active participles express a continuous aspect regarding the action of the verb but the tense or sense of time of the action is determined solely by context2 passive participles the qal passive participle occurs much less frequently than the active participle its basic pattern is as follows notice again that these are the same endings you studied for nouns and adjectives what is different however is the schema showing xxx with a characteristic vowel pattern these xs refer to the root letters of a given verb and the shureq after the second letter is the characteristic sign of the qal passive participle note that a qibbuts may appear instead of the shureq in the pattern an example should make this clear in general the vowel pattern for the root letters can vary depending on the class of verb strong or weak being inflected but in every case you will see the shureq or qibbuts between the second and third letters of the root of the word the passive participle is used in the same way as an active participle as an adjective a substantive or as a verb section exercises
