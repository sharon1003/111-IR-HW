computers  internet hardware other  hardware difference between c drive and e drive hi there im running a vista laptop and i have a c drive and an e drive  i know that a c drive is typically where to store my documents my pics etcso what is the e drive for i am running out of space on the c drive and was wondering if the e drive can be used in the same way thanks update thanks for the replies  i have looked and it says data e whereas my c says vista c it was already there when i first started the computer up and its not a usb or cddvd update 2 so does data e mean that is just another drive that can be used to store documents and pictures etc on1 following 1 answer answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer well if your e drive is a partition of one large drive it may be being used as vistas backup area and isnt very large just big enough to hold the backup information needed you can technically store information there but i wouldnt recommend it if the e drive is a cd drive then you cant store any information on it however if the e drive is a partition you made which i doubt given the nature of the question no insult intended or a separate hard drive then yes its storage space you can use just like you would your c drive you can even install programs there though a little bit will probably get written to the registry on the c drive when you go to install a program just change the install path to the other drive letter philbert flange · 9 years ago0 0 comment askers rating re difference between c drive and e drive hi there im running a vista laptop and i have a c drive and an e drive  i know that a c drive is typically where to store my documents my pics etcso what is the e drive for i am running out of space on the c drive and was wondering if the e drive can be used in the same way thanks source sdifference drive drive httpstrimurlima73differencebetweencdriveandedrive anonymous · 3 years ago0 0 commentdifference drive drive stacee · 2 years ago0 0 comment it depends on your particular system the e drive could be your cddvd or a usb drive or a recovery partition go to my computer for information about your drives bill m · 9 years ago1 0 comment the e drive is usually either a flash  usb drive or a dvdcd drivenicomp · 9 years ago0 0 comment in windows c is your hard drive e is usually a cddvd or a usbowsleys kid · 9 years ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these explore cell phones for seniors how to order contacts online want to build your own website look for franchises for sale
