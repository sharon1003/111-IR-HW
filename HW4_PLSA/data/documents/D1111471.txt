a radar view of venus taken by the magellan spacecraft with some gaps filled in by the pioneer venus orbiter credit nasajplguide to space venus the planet venus article written 26 jul  2015 updated 6 feb  2017 by matt williams as the morning star the evening star and the brightest natural object in the sky after the moon human beings have been aware of venus since time immemorial even though it would be many thousands of years before it was recognized as being a planet its has been a part of human culture since the beginning of recorded history because of this the planet has played a vital role in the mythology and astrological systems of countless peoples with the dawn of the modern age interest in venus has grown and observations made about its position in the sky changes in appearance and similar characteristics to earth have taught us much about our solar system size mass and orbit because of its similar size mass proximity to the sun and composition venus is often referred to as earth’s “sister planet” with a mass of 48676×10 24 kg a surface area of 460 x 10 8 km² and a volume of 928×10 11 km 3 venus is 815 as massive as earth and has 90 of its surface area and 866 of its volume venus orbits the sun at an average distance of about 072 au 108000000 km67000000 mi with almost no eccentricity in fact with its farthest orbit aphelion of 0728 au 108939000 km and closest orbit perihelion of 0718 au 107477000 km it has the most circular orbit of any planet in the solar system size comparison of venus and earth credit nasajplmagellan when venus lies between earth and the sun a position known as inferior conjunction it makes the closest approach to earth of any planet at an average distance of 41 million km making it the closest planet to earth  this takes place on average once every 584 days the planet completes an orbit around the sun every 22465 days meaning that a year on venus is 615 as long as a year on earth unlike most other planets in the solar system which rotate on their axes in an counterclockwise direction venus rotates clockwise called “retrograde” rotation it also rotates very slowly taking 243 earth days to complete a single rotation this is not only the slowest rotation period of any planet it also means that a sidereal day on venus lasts longer than a venusian year composition and surface features little direct information is available on the internal structure of venus however based on its similarities in mass and density to earth scientists believe that they share a similar internal structure – a core mantle and crust like that of earth the venusian core is believed to be at least be partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate one difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics which could be due to its crust being too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous this results in reduced heat loss from the planet preventing it from cooling and the possibility that internal heat is lost in periodic major resurfacing events this is also suggested as a possible reason for why venus has no internally generated magnetic field the internal structure of venus – the crust outer layer the mantle middle layer and the core yellow inner layer credit wikipedia commons venus’ surface appears to have been shaped by extensive volcanic activity venus also has several times as many volcanoes as earth and has 167 large volcanoes that are over 100 km across the presence of these volcanoes is due to the lack of plate tectonics which results in an older more preserved crust whereas earth’s oceanic crust is subject to subduction at its plate boundaries and is on average 100 million years old the venusian surface is estimated to be 300600 million years of age there are indications that volcanic activity may be ongoing on venus missions performed by the soviet space program in 1970s and more recently by the european space agency have detected lightning storms in venus’ atmosphere since venus does not experience rainfall except in the form of sulfuric acid it has been theorized that the lightning is being caused by a volcanic eruption other evidence is the periodic rise and fall of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere which could be the result of periodic large volcanic eruptions and finally localized infrared hot spots likely to be in the range of 800 – 1100 k have appeared on the surface which could represent lava freshly released by volcanic eruptions the preservation of venus’ surface is also responsible for its impact craters which are impeccably preserved almost a thousand craters exist which are evenly distributed across the surface and range from 3 km to 280 km in diameter no craters smaller than 3 km exist because of the effect the dense atmosphere has on incoming objects3d perspective of the venusian volcano maat mons generated from radar data from nasa’s magellan mission essentially objects with less than a certain amount of kinetic energy are slowed down so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater and incoming projectiles less than 50 meters in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground atmosphere and climate surface observations of venus have been difficult in the past due to its extremely dense atmosphere which is composed primarily of carbon dioxide with a small amount of nitrogen at 92 bar 92 mpa the atmospheric mass is 93 times that of earth’s atmosphere and the pressure at the planet’s surface is about 92 times that at earth’s surface venus is also the hottest planet in our solar system with a mean surface temperature of 735 k 462 °c8636 °f this is due to the co²rich atmosphere which along with thick clouds of sulfur dioxide generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the solar system above the dense co² layer thick clouds consisting mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets scatter about 90 of the sunlight back into space the surface of venus is effectively isothermal which means that their is virtually no variation in venus’ surface temperature between day and night or the equator and the poles the planet’s minute axial tilt – less than 3° compared to earth’s 23° – also minimizes seasonal temperature variation the only appreciable variation in temperature occurs with altitude the highest point on venus maxwell montes is therefore the coolest point on the planet with a temperature of about 655 k 380 °c and an atmospheric pressure of about 45 mpa 45 bar why is venus so horrible the history of the formation of venus your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  422another common phenomena is venus’ strong winds which reach speeds of up to 85 ms 300 kmh 1864 mph at the cloud tops and circle the planet every four to five earth days at this speed these winds move up to 60 times the speed of the planet’s rotation whereas earth’s fastest winds are only 1020 of the planet’s rotational speed venus flybys have also indicated that its dense clouds are capable of producing lightning much like the clouds on earth their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity and the lightning rate is at least half of that on earth historical observations although ancients peoples knew about venus some of the cultures thought it was two separate celestial objects – the evening star and the morning star although the babylonians realized that these two “stars” were in fact the same object – as indicated in the venus tablet of ammisaduqa dated 1581 bce – it was not until the 6th century bce that this became a common scientific understanding many cultures have identified the planet with their respective goddess of love and beauty venus is the roman name for the goddess of love while the babylonians named it ishtar and the greeks called it aphrodite the romans also designated the morning aspect of venus lucifer literally “lightbringer” and the evening aspect as vesper “evening” “supper” “west” both of which were literal translations of the respective greek names phosphorus and hesperus venus approaches the sun in a 2012 transit visible from earth credit nasathe transit of venus in front of the sun was first observed in 1032 by the persian astronomer avicenna who concluded that venus is closer to earth than the sun in the 12th century the andalusian astronomer ibn bajjah observed two black spots in front of the sun which were later identified as the transits of venus and mercury by iranian astronomer qotb aldin shirazi in the 13th century modern observations by the early 17th century the transit of venus was observed by english astronomer jeremiah horrocks on december 4th 1639 from his home william crabtree a fellow english astronomer and friend of horrocks’ observed the transit at the same time also from his home when the galileo galilei first observed the planet in the early 17th century he found it showed phases like the moon varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa this behavior which could only be possible if venus’ orbited the sun became part of galileo’s challenge to the ptolemaic geocentric model and his advocacy of the copernican heliocentric model the atmosphere of venus was discovered in 1761 by russian polymath mikhail lomonosov and then observed in 1790 by german astronomer johann schröter schröter found when the planet was a thin crescent the cusps extended through more than 180° he correctly surmised this was due to the scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere artist’s impression of the surface of venus credit esaaoesin december 1866 american astronomer chester smith lyman made observations of venus from the yale observatory where he was on the board of managers while observing the planet he spotted a complete ring of light around the dark side of the planet when it was at inferior conjunction providing further evidence for an atmosphere little else was discovered about venus until the 20th century when the development of spectroscopic radar and ultraviolet observations made it possible to scan the surface the first uv observations were carried out in the 1920s when frank e ross found that uv photographs revealed considerable detail which appeared to be the result of a dense yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it spectroscopic observations in the early 20th century also gave the first clues about the venusian rotation vesto slipher tried to measure the doppler shift of light from venus after finding that he could not detect any rotation he surmised the planet must have a very long rotation period later work in the 1950s showed the rotation was retrograde radar observations of venus were first carried out in the 1960s and provided the first measurements of the rotation period which were close to the modern value radar observations in the 1970s using the radio telescope at the arecibo observatory in puerto rico revealed details of the venusian surface for the first time – such as the presence of the maxwell montes mountains exploration of venus the first attempts to explore venus were mounted by the soviets in the 1960s through the venera program the first spacecraft venera1 also known in the west as sputnik8 was launched on february 12th 1961 however contact was lost seven days into the mission when the probe was about 2 million km from earth by midmay it was estimated that the probe had passed within 100000 km 62000 miles of venus the mariner 1 and 2 spacecrafts made their way to venus mariner 2 was the first successful venus flyby on  credit nasajplthe united states launched the mariner 1 probe on july 22nd 1962 with the intent of conducting a venus flyby but here too contact was lost during launch the mariner 2 mission which launched on december 14th 1962 became the first successful interplanetary mission and passed within 34833 km 21644 mi of venus’ surface its observations confirmed earlier groundbased observations which indicated that though the cloud tops were cool the surface was extremely hot – at least 425 °c 797 °f this put an end all speculation that the planet might harbor life mariner 2 also obtained improved estimates of venus’s mass but was unable to detect either a magnetic field or radiation belts the venera3 spacecraft was the soviets second attempt to reach venus and their first attempted to place a lander on the planet’s surface the spacecraft cashlanded on venus on march 1st 1966 and was the first manmade object to enter the atmosphere and strike the surface of another planet unfortunately its communication system failed before it was able to return any planetary data on october 18th 1967 the soviets tried again with the venera4 spacecraft after reaching the planet the probe successfully entered the atmosphere and began studying the atmosphere in addition to noting the prevalence of carbon dioxide 9095 it measured temperatures in excess of what mariner 2 observed reaching almost 500 °c due to the thickness of venus’ atmosphere the probe descended slower than anticipated and its batteries ran out after 93 minutes when the probe was still 2496 km from the surface the mariner 10 spacecraft credit nasajplone day later on october 19th 1967 mariner 5 conducted a flyby at a distance of less than 4000 km above the cloud tops originally built as a backup for the marsbound mariner 4 the probe was refitted for a venus mission after venera4 ‘s success the probe managed to collect information on the composition pressure and density of the venusian atmosphere which was then analyzed alongside the venera4 data by a sovietamerican science team during a series of symposiums venera5 and venera6 were launched in january of 1969 and reached venus on 16th and 17th of may taking into account the extreme density and pressure of venus’ atmosphere these probes were able to achieve a faster descent and reached an altitude of 20 km before being crushed – but not before returning over 50 minutes of atmospheric data the venera7 was built with the intent of returning data from the planet’s surface and was construed with a reinforced descent module capable of withstanding intense pressure while entering the atmosphere on december 15th 1970 the probe crashed on the surface apparently due to a ripped parachute luckily it managed to return 23 minutes of temperature data and the first telemetry from the another planet’s surface before going offline the soviets launched three more venera probes between 1972 and 1975 the first landed on venus on july 22nd 1972 and managed to transmit data for 50 minutes venera9 and 10 – which entered venus’ atmosphere on october 22nd and october 25th 1975 respectively – both managed to send back images of venus’ surface the first images ever taken of another planet’s landscape images of venusian surface taken by the venera 10 lander on october 25th 1977 credit russian space webdonald mitchell on november 3rd 1973 the united states had sent the mariner 10 probe on a gravitational slingshot trajectory past venus on its way to mercury by february 5th 1974 the probe passed within 5790 km of venus returning over 4000 photographs the images which were the best to date showed the planet to be almost featureless in visible light but revealed neverbeforeseen details about the clouds in ultraviolet light by the late seventies nasa commenced the pioneer venus project which consisted of two separate missions the first was the pioneer venus orbiter which inserted into an elliptical orbit around venus on december 4th 1978 where it studied its atmosphere and mapped the surface for a period of 13 days the second the pioneer venus multiprobe released a total of four probes which entered the atmosphere on december 9th 1978 returning data on its composition winds and heat fluxes four more venera lander missions took place between the late 70s and early 80s venera 11 and venera 12 detected venusian electrical storms and venera 13 and venera 14 landed on the planet on march 1st and 5th 1982 returning the first color photographs of the surface the venera program came to a close in october 1983 when venera 15 and venera 16 were placed in orbit to conduct mapping of the venusian terrain with synthetic aperture radar in 1985 the soviets participated in a collaborative venture with several european states to launch the vega program this twospacecraft initiative was intended to take advantage of the appearance of halley’s comet in the inner solar system and combine a mission to it with a flyby of venus while en route to halley on june 11th and 15th the two vega spacecraft dropped venerastyle probes supported by balloons into the upper atmosphere – which discovered that it was more turbulent than previously estimated and subject to high winds and powerful convection cells the first color pictures taken of the surface of venus by the venera13 space probe credit nasanasa’s magellan spacecraft was launched on may 4th 1989 with a mission to map the surface of venus with radar in the course of its four and a half year mission magellan provided the most highresolution images to date of the planet and was able to map 98 of the surface and 95 of its gravity field in 1994 at the end of its mission magellan was sent to its destruction into the atmosphere of venus to quantify its density venus was observed by the galileo and cassini spacecraft during flybys on their respective missions to the outer planets but magellan was the last dedicated mission to venus for over a decade it was not until october of 2006 and june of 2007 that the messenger probe would conduct a flyby of venus and collect data in order to slow its trajectory for an eventual orbital insertion of mercury the venus express a probe designed and built by the european space agency successfully assumed polar orbit around venus on april 11th 2006 this probe conducted a detailed study of the venusian atmosphere and clouds and discovered an ozone layer and a swirling doublevortex at the south pole before concluding its mission in december of 2014 future missions the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa devised a venus orbiter – akatsuki formerly “planetc” – to conduct surface imaging with an infrared camera studies on venus’ lightning and to determine the existence of current volcanism the craft was launched on may 20th 2010 but the craft failed to enter orbit in december 2010 its main engine is still offline but its controllers will attempt to use its small attitude control thrusters to make another orbital insertion attempt on december 7th 2015 artist’s concept of the venus in situ explorer mission which could be deployed to venus by 2022 credit nasain late 2013 nasa launched the venus spectral rocket experiment a suborbital space telescope this experimented is intended to conduct ultraviolet light studies of venus’s atmosphere for the purpose of learning more about the history of water on venus the european space agency’s esa bepi colombo mission which will launch in january 2017 will perform two flybys of venus before it reaches mercury orbit in 2020 nasa will launch the solar probe plus in 2018 which will perform seven venus flybys during its sixyear mission to study the sun under its new frontiers program nasa has proposed mounting a lander mission to venus called the venus insitu explorer by 2022 the purpose will be to study venus’ surface conditions and investigate the elemental and mineralogical features of the regolith the probe would be equipped with a core sampler to drill into the surface and study pristine rock samples not weathered by the harsh surface conditions the venerad spacecraft is a proposed russian space probe to venus which is scheduled to be launched around 2024 this mission will conduct remotesensing observations around the planet and deploy a lander based on the venera design capable of surviving for a long duration on the surface a way to explore venus your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  335because of its proximity to earth and its similarity in size mass and composition venus was once believed to hold life in fact the idea of venus being a tropical world persisted well into the 20th century until the venera and mariner programs demonstrated the absolute hellish conditions that actually exist on the planet nevertheless it is believed that venus may once have been much like earth with a similar atmosphere and warm flowing water on its surface this notion is supported by the fact that venus sits within the inner edge of the sun’s habitable zone and has an ozone layer however owing to the runaway greenhouse effect and the lack of a magnetic field this water disappeared many billions of years ago still there are those who believed that venus could one day support human colonies currently the atmospheric pressure near to the ground is far too extreme for settlements to be built on the surface but 50 km above the surface both the temperature and air pressure are similar to earth’s and both nitrogen and oxygen are believed to exist this has led to proposals for “floating cities” to be built in the venusian atmosphere and the exploration of the atmosphere using airships in addition proposals have been made suggesting the venus should be terraformed these have ranged from installing a huge spaceshade to combat the greenhouse effect to crashing comets into the surface to blow the atmosphere off other ideas involve converting the atmosphere using calcium and magnesium to sequester the carbon away how do we terraform venus turning this hellish world into something earthlike your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  424much like proposals to terraform mars these ideas are all in their infancy and are hardpressed to address the longterm challenges associated with changing the planet’s climate however they do show that humanity’s fascination with venus has not diminished over time from being a central to our mythology and the first star we saw in the morning and the last one we saw at night venus has since gone on to become a subject of fascination for astronomers and a possible prospect for offworld real estate but until such time as technology improves venus will remain earth’s hostile and inhospitable “sister planet” with intense pressure sulfuric acid rains and a toxic atmosphere we have written many interesting articles about venus here at universe today for example here’s the planet venus interesting facts

suggestion…i know the first picture is a radar image of venus but some people may think this is what we see through a telescope i think it would be good service if we could have some key under every picture to say “artists impression” “radar high reflection yellow – low reflection red or the different colours for the composite images say purple for xrays or simulated vision mars images enhanced colour maybe an illustration for how it has been enhanced or real matched vision yes this information may be in the text but you see the eyecandy first and read the text later and do not always use the second to correct the first this may not be easy the mariner pictures were a genuine attempt at reporting visible rgb with test charts to calibrate the camera but the camera was designed to get the best information for recognising minerals and got the balance between redorange and infra red wrong i expect most of these images have been published without a key but if you can get ordinary people to think when they look at a colour image “hang on – there’s no key here – what do these colours actually mean” you will have done a great good log in to replypostman1 says july 26 2015 at 606 pmfrazer another really good article thank you one small nitpick in the second to last paragraph “from being a central part in our mythology and the first star we saw in the morning and the last one we saw at night” shouldn’t it read instead ‘last star we saw in the morning and the first we saw at night’ thanks againlog in to replypostman1 says july 28 2015 at 630 pmmatt williams not frazer log in to replybazbsg says july 26 2015 at 1050 pmnice article i like that so much information is packed into one article and also combined to give insights that i hadn’t had before example less cratering due to the thick atmosphere log in to reply far away long ago says july 27 2015 at 728 amgreat article i think it is good to focus on mars but venus does deserve more attention it is the easiest planet to reach both in terms of deltav and launch windows and also thanks to possible aerobraking in its atmosphere it is also the most earth like planet in several respects and the first exoplanetary atmosphere we can detect in the next few years could be like venus i don’t want to sound kinky but i do think we should undress our hot sister now if you just search the word “venus” in the linked page below you find excellent lectures on venus they can actually do seismology from the atmosphere and maybe even from orbit nowadays httpswwwyoutubecomuserkisscaltech log in to reply member aqua4u says july 27 2015 at 354 pmgreat article very thorough and informative thanksi’d like to see more computer simulations of how the planets might have assumed their current orbits and rotations definitely venus and uranus are oddballs how did they get that way could it be that sol at one point in it’s billions of years history have captured a wandering planetary body s from a nearby coevolving sibling star s or was it just a ‘bump in the night’ due to orbital evolutions log in to reply memberrobst247 says july 27 2015 at 604 pmthanks for the very insightful and comprehensive article fraser one aspect that really surprised me was that russian and american scientists worked together to analyse data from mariner 5 and venera 4 i had thought that such collaboration was impossible during the cold war period ps the artist’s impression of the venusian surface shows a striking similarity to the land of mordor where the shadows lie log in to reply leave
