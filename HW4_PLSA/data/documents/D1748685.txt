the next step in quantification requires you to extract edge intensities from spectrum while you disregard the underlying background intensity to separate the edge intensity you will need to fit extrapolate and then subtract a background model it is important to consider the following items when you perform this critical extraction step which background model should i use where should i fit the background model to the data what are the optimal width and position for the signal integration window theory stepbystep background modeling to extract the edge intensity you must determine a model for the background of your spectrum first identify a preedge fitting region that allows you to determine parameters of the fit then extrapolate this fit to estimate the background intensity below the edge signal however an accurate background subtraction may become difficult below 100 e v due to the large number of scattering processes in this region eg plasmons tails plural scattering typically the model is determined using linear leastsquares methods using a single preedge regionwhere background fit window signal integration window background intensity signal intensity power law a power law is the most common background modelwhere scaling constant slope exponent usually 2 – 6this model has the physical basis when interpreted as the long energy tails of the preceding energy loss events background model placement when you choose the optimal background placement it is important to consider these parameters the high energy side should be as close to but still preceding the edge eg 5 e v to avoid chemical shifts and broadening detector tails to limit statistical error fit region should be as wide as possible to limit systematic error you need to limit the fit region to 10 – 30rules of thumb to follow background window end should be 5 e v from edge onset background window width should be at most 30 edge energy may need to limit window size to avoid preceding edges where necessary troubleshoot background extrapolation errors once background placement is made it is important to review common errors unphysical symptom – obvious error where the background model crosses the spectrum and may cause the signal to become negative solution – increase the window size andor offset it from the edge onset you may need to limit the extrapolation distance of your analysis systematic errors symptom – small changes in the background window width or position have large effects on the background model solution – ensure small variations in window position do not change background fit significantly increase size of window the background in this case changes rapidly as the window position is moved a larger window and avoiding the edge onset region are recommended overlapping edges symptom – background extrapolation is ineffective for instances where the preedge region is obscured by the preceding edge solution – reduce the window size or placement as well as limit the signal window size and offset a multiple linear leastsquares  mlls fitting or model based approach may be necessary width and position of signal integration window when you choose the optimal signal integration window placement it is important to consider statistical error – the region should be as wide as possible and start at the steepest intensity increase of the spectrum hydrogenic edges eg k some ledges – place window at threshold delayed edges eg l m n oedges – offset by a few tens of e vsystematic error – limit fit region to about 10 but it should cover all of the significant energy loss near edge structure elnes changes white lines – best to avoid inclusion for quantitative evaluation as their intensity can vary with chemical state and are not well modeled in crosssection calculations signal extraction with gms 3 software with gatan microscopy suite ® gms 3 software the process of signal extraction is highly automated however the guidelines and concepts above still must be considered gms 3 quantification utilizes a model based approach where the spectral background and the edge intensity are treated as single model if there are overlapping edges present they are also added to the model to allow separation of the overlap follow the below steps for eels signal extraction in gms 3 software identify the edge features within the spectrum show fit regions on spectrum using the show signal setup button in the elemental analysis window the edge model will be shown on the spectrum default values are typically adequate but the regions of interest can be dynamically changed by the user if needed the eels edge setup button allows specific set up for each edge exclude elnes – removes the near edge structure from the analysis include plural scattering – e nables linking to lowloss spectrum and is required for absolute quantification most settings dynamically update if the fit region is adjusted on the spectrum exclude elnes allows the model to begin after a predetermined elnes region this leads to more consistent fitting to the calculated crosssection and should be used when fitting strong edges for semiquantitative mapping the elnes region should be included to get the best signaltonoise snr in the maps edges that are close in energy are automatically tagged for overlap analysis you can change this default using the overlaps check box in the edge setup dialog the fit to the edge model less the models for the background and any proceeding edges yields the extracted signal intensity for that edge overlapping edges are fit together as a single model the total signal for the overlapped edge includes contribution from the preceding edge background references joy d c maher d m the quantization of electron
