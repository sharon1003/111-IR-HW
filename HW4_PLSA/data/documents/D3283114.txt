31 terms lawoflaw misrepresentation learn flashcards write spell test match gravity advertisement upgrade to remove ads sort1 a misrepresentation is a misrepresentation is a false statement of fact made by one party to another which whilst not being a term of the contract induces the other party to enter the contract the effect of an actionable misrepresentation is to make the contract voidable giving the innocent party the right to rescind the contract andor claim damages1 false statement of fact an actionable misrepresentation must be a false statement of fact not opinion or future intention or law a statements of opinion a false statement of opinion is not a misrepresentation of fact see  bisset v wilkinson 1927 ac 177 however where the person giving the statement was in a position to know the true facts and it can be proved that he could not reasonably have held such a view as a result then his opinion will be treated as a statement of fact see  smith v land  house property corp 1884 28 ch d 7 some expressions of opinion are mere puffs thus in dimmock v hallet 1866 2 ch app 21 the description of land as fertile and improvable was held not to constitute a representation b statements as to the future a false statement by a person as to what he will do in the future is not a misrepresentation and will not be binding on a person unless the statement is incorporated into a contract however if a person knows that his promise which has induced another to enter into a contract will not in fact be carried out then he will be liable see  edgington v fitzmaurice 1885 29 ch d 459  esso petroleum v mardon 1976 qb 801 c statements of the law a false statement as to the law is not actionable misrepresentation because everyone is presumed to know the law however the distinction between fact and law is not simple see  solle v butcher 1950 1 kb 671 d silence generally silence is not a misrepresentation the effect of the maxim caveat emptor is that the other party has no duty to disclose problems voluntarily thus if one party is labouring under a misapprehension there is no duty on the other party to correct it see  smith v hughes 1871 lr 6 qb 597 however there are three fundamental exceptions to this rule d silence however there are three fundamental exceptions to this rule 1 i half truths the representor must not misleadingly tell only part of the truth thus a statement that does not present the whole truth may be regarded as a misrepresentation see  nottingham brick  tile co v butler 1889 16 qbd 778 d silence however there are three fundamental exceptions to this rule 2 ii statements which become false where a statement was true when made out but due to a change of circumstances has become false by the time it is acted upon there is a duty to disclose the truth see  with v oflanagan 1936 ch 575 d silence however there are three fundamental exceptions to this rule 3 iii contracts uberrimae fidei contracts uberrimae fidei contracts of the utmost good faith impose a duty of disclosure of all material facts because one party is in a strong position to know the truth examples would include contracts of insurance and family settlements a material fact is something which would influence a reasonable person in making the contract if one party fails to do this the contract may be avoided see  lambert v cooperative insurance society 1975 2 lloyds rep 485 where there is a fiduciary relationship between the parties to a contract a duty of disclosure will arise eg solicitor and client bank manager and client trustee and beneficiary and interfamily agreements e other representations e other representations the term statement is not to be interpreted too literally  in gordon v selico ltd 1986 278 eg 53 it was held that painting over dry rot immediately prior to sale of the property was a fraudulent misrepresentation  in st marylebone property v payne 1994 45 eg 156 the use of a photograph taken from the air printed with arrows misleadingly indicating the extent of land boundaries was held to convey a statement of fact which amounted to actionable misrepresentation2 the misrepresentation must have induced the contract the false statement must have induced the false statement must have induced the representee to enter into the contract the requirements here are that a the misrepresentation must be material and b it must have been relied on a materiality the misrepresentation must be material a materiality the misrepresentation must be material in the sense that it would have induced a reasonable person to enter into the contract however the rule is not strictly objective in museprime properties v adhill properties 1990 36 eg 114 the judge referred with approval to the view of goff and jones law of restitution that any misrepresentation which induces a person to enter into a contract should be a ground for rescission of that contract if the misrepresentation would have induced a reasonable person to enter into the contract then the court will presume that the representee was so induced and the onus will be on the representor to show that the representee did not rely on the misrepresentation either wholly or in part if however the misrepresentation would not have induced a reasonable person to contract the onus will be on the misrepresentee to show that the misrepresentation induced him to act as he did see  museprime properties v adhill properties 1990 36 eg 114 b reliance the representee must have relied on the misrepresentation there will be no reliance if the misrepresentee was unaware of the misrepresentation etc b reliance the representee must have relied on the misrepresentation there will be no reliance if the misrepresentee was unaware of the misrepresentation see  horsfall v thomas 1862 1 hc 90 there will be no reliance if the representee does not rely on the misrepresentation but on his own judgment or investigations see  attwood v small 1838 6 ci  f 232 note this rule does not apply where the misrepresentation was fraudulent and the representee was asked to check the accuracy of the statement pearson v dublin corp 1907 ac 351 there will be reliance even if the misrepresentee is given an opportunity to discover the truth but does not take the offer up the misrepresentation will still be considered as an inducement see  redgrave v hurd 1881 20 ch d 1 there will be reliance even if the misrepresentation was not the only inducement for the representee to enter into the contract see  edgington v fitzmaurice above3 types of misrepresentation once misrepresentation has been established it is necessary to consider what type of misrepresentation has been made there are three types of misrepresentation the importance of the distinction lies in the remedies available for each type once misrepresentation has been established it is necessary to consider what type of misrepresentation has been made there are three types of misrepresentation fraudulent negligent and wholly innocent the importance of the distinction lies in the remedies available for each type a fraudulent misrepresentation a fraudulent misrepresentation fraudulent misrepresentation was defined by lord herschell in derry v peek 1889 as a false statement that is made i knowingly or ii without belief in its truth or iii recklessly careless as to whether it be true or false therefore if someone makes a statement which they honestly believe is true then it cannot be fraudulent see  derry v peek 1889 14 app cas 337 the burden of proof is on the plaintiff  he who asserts fraud must prove it tactically it may be difficult to prove fraud in the light of lord herschells requirements the remedy is rescission subject to exceptions discussed later and damages in the tort of deceit see later b negligent misrepresentation there are two possible ways to claim either under common law or statute b negligent misrepresentation this is a false statement made by a person who had no reasonable grounds for believing it to be true there are two possible ways to claim either under common law or statute b negligent misrepresentation there are two possible ways to claim either under common law or statute 1 i negligent misstatement at common law the house of lords have held that in certain circumstances damages may be recoverable in tort for negligent misstatement causing financial loss  hedley byrne v heller 1964 ac 465 success depends upon proof of a special relationship existing between the parties such a duty can arise in a purely commercial relationship where the representor has or purports to have some special skill or knowledge and knows or it is reasonable for him to assume that the representee will rely on the representation see  esso petroleum v mardon 1976 above  williams v natural life health foods 1998 the times may 1 the remedies are rescission subject to exceptions discussed later and damages in the tort of negligence see later b negligent misrepresentation there are two possible ways to claim either under common law or statute 1 ii negligent misrepresentation under s2 1 misrepresentation act 1967 section 2 1 of the misrepresentation act 1967 provides where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party thereto and as a result thereof he has suffered loss then if the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently that person shall be so liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently unless he proves that he had reasonable ground to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true this provision does not require the representee to establish a duty of care and reverses the burden of proof once a party has proved that there has been a misrepresentation which induced him to enter into the contract the person making the misrepresentation will be liable in damages unless he proves he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe that the facts represented were true this burden may be difficult to discharge as shown in  howard marine  dredging co v ogden  sons 1978 qb 574 remedies recent caselaw has shown that the remedies available are as those available in fraud unless the representor discharges the burden of proof in particular damages will be based in the tort of deceit rather than the tort of negligence see later c wholly innocent misrepresentation this is a false statement which the person makes honestly believing it to be true the remedy is either c wholly innocent misrepresentation this is a false statement which the person makes honestly believing it to be true the remedy is either  i rescission with an indemnity or  ii damages in lieu of rescission under the courts discretion in s2 2 misrepresentation act 1967 see below4 remedies for misrepresentation 4 remedies for misrepresentation once an actionable misrepresentation has been established it is then necessary to consider the remedies available to the misrepresentee remedies for misrepresentation a rescission a rescission rescission ie setting aside the contract is possible in all cases of misrepresentation the aim of rescission is to put the parties back in their original position as though the contract had not been made the injured party may rescind the contract by giving notice to the representor however this is not always necessary as any act indicating repudiation eg notifying the authorities may suffice see  car  universal finance v caldwell 1965 1 qb 525 bars to rescission rescission is an equitable remedy and is awarded at the discretion of the court rescission is an equitable remedy and is awarded at the discretion of the court the injured party may lose the right to rescind in the following four circumstances bars to rescission i affirmation of the contract i affirmation of the contract the injured party will affirm the contract if with full knowledge of the misrepresentation and of their right to rescind they expressly state that they intend to continue with the contract or if they do an act from which the intention may be implied see  long v lloyd 1958 1 wlr 753 note that in peyman v lanjani 1985 ch 457 the court of appeal held that the plaintiff had not lost his right to rescind because knowing of the facts which afforded this right he proceeded with the contract unless he also knew of the right to rescind the plaintiff here did not know he had such right as he did not know he had such right he could not be said to have elected to affirm the contract bars to rescission ii lapse of time ii lapse of time if the injured party does not take action to rescind within a reasonable time the right will be lost where the misrepresentation is fraudulent time runs from the time when the fraud was or with reasonable diligence could have been discovered in the case of nonfraudulent misrepresentation time runs from the date of the contract not the date of discovery of the misrepresentation see leaf v international galleries 1950 2 kb 86 iii restitution in integrum impossible the injured party will lose the right to rescind if substantial restoration is impossible ie if the parties cannot be restored to their original position see vigers v pike 1842 8 cif 562 precise restoration is not required and the remedy is still available if substantial restoration is possible thus deterioration in the value or condition of property is not a bar to rescission armstrong v jackson 1917 2 kb 822 iv third party acquires rights iv third party acquires rights if a third party acquires rights in property in good faith and for value the misrepresentee will lose their right to rescind see phillips v brooks 1919 2 kb 243 under mistake thus if a obtains goods from b by misrepresentation and sells them to c who takes in good faith b cannot later rescind when he discovers the misrepresentation in order to recover the goods from c v note the right to rescind the contract will also be lost if the court exercises its discretion to award damages in lieu of rescission under s2 2 of the misrepresentation act 1967 for innocent misrepresentation two previous bars to rescission were removed by s1 of the misrepresentation act 1967 the misrepresentee can rescind despite the misrepresentation becoming a term of the contract s1 a and the misrepresentee can rescind even if the contract has been executed s1 b generally this will be relevant to contracts for the sale of land and to tenancies b indemnity this is a money payment by the misrepresentor in respect of expenses necessarily created in complying with the terms of the contract and is different from damages see b indemnity an order of rescission may be accompanied by the court ordering an indemnity this is a money payment by the misrepresentor in respect of expenses necessarily created in complying with the terms of the contract and is different from damages see  whittington v sealehayne 1900 82 lt 49 c damages i fraudulent misrepresentation the injured party may claim damages for fraudulent misrepresentation in the tort of deceit i fraudulent misrepresentation the injured party may claim damages for fraudulent misrepresentation in the tort of deceit the purpose of damages is to restore the victim to the position he occupied before the representation had been made the test of remoteness in deceit is that the injured party may recover for all the direct loss incurred as a result of the fraudulent misrepresentation regardless of foreseeability  doyle v olby ironmongers ltd 1969 2 qb 158 moreover damages may include lost opportunity costs eg loss of profits see5 excluding liability for misrepresentation any term of a contract which excludes liability for misrepresentation or restricts the remedy available is subject to the test of reasonableness section 3 of the misrepresentation act 1967 as amended by s8 of ucta 1977 provides that if a contract contains a term which would exclude or restrict a any liability to which a party to a contract may be subject by reason of any misrepresentation made by him before the contract was made or b any remedy available to another party to the contract by reason of such a misrepresentation that term shall be of no effect except insofar as it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in s11 1 of the unfair contract terms act 1977 and it is for those claiming that the term satisfies that requirement to show that it does section 11 1 ucta 1977 provides that  the term shall have been a fair and reasonable one to be included having regard to the circumstances which were or ought reasonably to have been known to or in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made essential points you should know essential points you should
