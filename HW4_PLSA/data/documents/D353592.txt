wilt chamberlain19361999american basketball player i n a 14year professional career studded with superlatives wilt chamberlain established the centrality of court dominance in basketball and thus changed the game forever at seven feet one inch tall he was a towering figure nicknamed wilt the stilt — a moniker he is said to have despised chamberlain was not simply a goliath however he was also extraordinarily coordinated and seemed to score and rebound almost without effort along the way he racked up countless records including the highest number of points for a single player in a single game 100 the most rebounds 55 and the greatest number of consecutive field goals 18 chamberlain was no stranger to controversy as when he claimed in 1991 that he had bedded more than 20000 women yet the controversy would hardly have mattered if his performance as a player had not been so extraordinary at the time of his retirement chamberlain had scored more points in his career — 31419 — than anyone in nba history the only player to exceed that record kareem abduljabbar said at chamberlains funeral wilt was one of the greatest ever and we will never see another like him even more poignant were the words of the boston celtics bill russell  with whom chamberlain engaged in a celebrated oncourt rivalry and offcourt friendship during the 1960s and 1970s he and i will be friends through eternity a giant at an early age named wilton after the street on which his parents lived in west philadelphia chamberlain was one of eight children born to william and olivia chamberlain william worked as a porter at a publishing company and olivia sometimes cleaned houses to supplement the familys income given chamberlains size one might guess that his parents or siblings were tall but such was not the case indeed none of the other nine chamberlains exceeded a modest 59 in height at the age of 10 wilt was already tall and he became positively gargantuan after he reached adolescence in a single summer he gained four inches and by the time he began playing for overbrook high school he stood 611 with his height he was a natural for basketball but from the beginning he was not simply big he was also graceful resourceful and creative as a player recruited by kansas beginning with his 195253 varsity year chamberlain led the overbrook team to a series of victories with season records of 192 190 and 181 his reputation as arebounder began at this early stage the overbrook high coach actually taught his players to miss free throws so that chamberlain could rebound them and score more valuable field goals in those days goaltending or hovering over the basket was still legal and chamberlain was known to tip a ball thrown by a teammate into the hoop even when it would have gone in anyway — a practice that irritated his fellow overbrook players at overbrook chamberlain did not confine himself to a single sport gaining notoriety on the cross country and track and field teams and even winning a conference title — not surprisingly — in the long jump it is also not surprising that college recruiters had their eye on chamberlain and that the university of kansas gave him a scholarship in terms of talent he qualified for the varsity team but ncaa national collegiate athletic association rules at the time prohibited freshmen from playing varsity basketball so chamberlain took his place on the jayhawks freshman squad in a significant showing of his skills chamberlain led the freshmen to victory in their first game — which happened to be against their varsity counterparts thanks to some 40 points 30 rebounds and 15 blocks courtesy of their extraordinary new player the freshmen trounced the varsity jayhawks 8171 on december 3 1956 chamberlain now a sophomore played his first game for the jayhawks varsity team in that game against northwestern he set a school record by scoring 52 points helping to ensure an 8769 victory in 1957 kansas went to the ncaa championships against the university of north carolina and though the jayhawks lost by a single point in triple overtime chamberlain himself earned the title of mvp most valuable player for the tournament from the jayhawks to the globetrotters to the warriors during his college years chamberlain played for allconference and allamerica teams and again showed his prowess off the court at the big eight track and field championships in which his 66 high jump won he was eager to get on with his career however and for very practical reasons he wanted to start earning money therefore he finished out his junior year at kansas and went on to the pros an nba national basketball association rule at the time forbade professional teams from hiring college players whose class had not yet graduated therefore chamberlain spent the year 195859 on a team quite literally in a league of its own a spot that earned him a salary of 50000 though hardly impressive in the world of pro basketball today at the time this was an almost inconceivably large salary for a basketball player chamberlain who would later tour with the globetrotters during a few summers in the 1960s joined his first nba team in 1959 thanks to the territorial draft rule established by the nba in 1955 a team could choose a local college player in exchange for its firstround draft pick even though chamberlain had actually played for a school far away philadelphia warriors owner eddie gottlieb claimed the philadelphia native and since kansas had no nba teams there was no competition for the 71 juggernaut once again chamberlain earned a distinction in this case as the only player in nba history to become a territorial pick based on his roots prior to college beginnings of rivalry with bill russell during that 195960 season chamberlain averaged 376 points and 27 rebounds per game and earned the title of nba rookie of the year allstar game mvp and nba mvp he was also selected for the allnba first team once again chamberlain was virtually without equal other than wes unseld nine years later no other player would win rookie and mvp recognition in a single year chronology1936 born august 21 in

which chamberlain propelled from last place to second place went up against the celtics in the 1960 nba playoffs thus beginning the legendary chamberlainrussell rivalry this was the first of eight years in which a team on which chamberlain played would meet the celtics in the playoffs but only once would chamberlains team gain victory over the celtics after the 42 loss to boston in the series chamberlain stunned fans by announcing that he was thinking of retiring after just one season precisely because of his size he was taking too much of a pounding from opposing teams who worked to level the playing field on the way committing numereous hard fouls against him chamberlain himself never fouled out once in 1045 regularseason and 160 playoff games a hallmark of his even temper on the court of course one could argue that he did not have to get angry given his physical dominance in any case all the abuse on the court was taking its toll on his body and to combat the effects chamberlain who was already strong made himself even stronger he worked out with weights and by the time he reached the peak of his career he tip the scale at 300 lean fast muscular pounds victory over boston — finally chamberlains second year with the warriors was every bit as good as his first and his third 196162 was significantly better with an average of 504 points in a game that was also the year when he became the only player in nba history to score more than 4000 points in a single season and on march 2 1962 he did something perhaps even more extraordinary he had been out partying the previous night and yet in a game against the new york knicks in hershey pennsylvania chamberlain scored 100 of the warriors 169 points against the knicks 147 as the minutes ticked by and his teammates became aware that they were witnessing history being made they began applying the old overbrook strategy of doing everything in their power to get the ball into chamberlains hands even fouling the knicks so that the legendary rebounder could take control chamberlain stayed with the warriors when they moved to san francisco in 1962 and during the two seasons that followed he was the leading scorer in the league then just two days after the 1965 nba allstar game the warriors traded him to the new philadelphia 76ers for three players and 150000 twice the sixers went up against chamberlains old nemesis boston only to lose — even in 1966 when they had earned the best record in the league at 55 wins and 25 losses then in the 196667 season philadelphia earned a 6813 record the best in league history up to that time in the division finals philadelphia trounced boston in five games ending an eightyear streak of celtics nba titles the championship found him up against his old team the warriors the 76ers came away victorious after six games giving chamberlain the first of only two championship wins in his career a team player the 196667 season would prove to be not only the halfway point of chamberlains career but also the high point as oscar robertson once said when a philadelphia daily news reporter asked him if chamberlain was the best player of all time the numbers dont lie — and this was equally true when assessing the relative decline that marked chamberlains latter years granted his 207 pointpergame average for the period 196774 was one for which most nba players would kill but it was only a little more than half as good as his 195967 record of 394 points per game a showing that only michael jordan has managed to equal career statistics yr team gp pts

reasons have been offered for chamberlains relative decline age and the effects of lifestyle including all those amorous encounters of which he boasted were obvious possibilities as was the development of better defenses by opposing teams chamberlain on the other hand maintained that his coaches — in a reversal of patterns that went back all the way his highschool years — did not want him shooting as much the fact was that while chamberlain did well teams on which he played did not tend to fare as well in the finals during that winning 196667 season on the other hand coach alex hannum instructed him to pass more and shoot less a strategy that obviously worked chamberlain took on his new more teamoriented role with alacrity leading the nba in assists during the 196768 season traded to the los angeles lakers in 1968 he went on to take his team to the finals four times and in 1972 won his second and last championship in five games against the knicks in his final years in the nba chamberlain distinguished himself as a team player alongside the likes of guard jerry west and others and in 197172 the lakers went one better than the record set by chamberlain and the 76ers in 196667 with a season record of 6913 a very busy retiree after he retired in 1973 chamberlain pursued a number of careers he coached the san diego conquistadors of the shortlived american basketball association for a season played tennis volleyball and racquetball and ran the honolulu marathon he coached a womens volleyball team and even challenged muhammad ali to a fight that never occurred despite hints that he might return to basketball chamberlain never did even before his retirement chamberlain had appeared in rowan  martins laugh in as well as a memorable volkswagen commercial that played on the length of his legs in relation to the size of the car he later did spots for brut aftershave and miller lite and appeared alongside arnold schwarzenegger and grace jones in conan the destroyer he also served as executive producer for the documentary go for it in 1976 in 1973 chamberlain published the first of two autobiographies wilt just like any other sevenfoot black millionaire who lives next door later published simply as wilt nearly two decades later a second autobiography this one called a view from above 1991 caused a much bigger stir with his claim of 20000 conquests nearly coinciding as it did with magic johnson s announcement that he was hivpositive the boast seemed illtimed and many observers criticized chamberlain for being irresponsible during his later years chamberlain suffered from heart trouble and his health declined quickly over a period of just a few weeks in the fall of 1999 he died of a heart attack at his home in the belair section of los angeles at age 63 in addition to russell and abduljabbar mourners at the city of angels church of religious science in los angeles included meadowlark lemon of the globetrotters west bill walton and jim brown the warrior chamberlain earned enemies in the african american community when he condemned the black power movement in the late 1960s he never aligned himself with civilrights leaders such as jesse jackson and invoked considerable ire when he supported richard nixon s campaigns for the presidency in 1968 and 1972 blacks and whites alike expressed antipathy toward chamberlains oftstated preference for white women related biography philadelphia warriors owner eddie gottlieb edward eddie gottlieb who in 1959 succeeded in claiming philadelphia native wilt chamberlain for his warriors on

well as professional wrestling he died december 7 1979 a bum rap go ahead and remember chamberlain as a scoring machine a braggart and a guy who needed some tutoring with his bedroom arithmetic he was certainly all of the above but you should remember him too as a winner if two world championships six trips to the nba finals and over 700 regular season victories dont make someone a winner what does

1214 in the world of basketball chamberlain won many a detractor with his candid talk and his outspoken persona in the mid1960s he caused a stir with a sports illustrated story in which he was quoted as criticizing various coaches and players provided his critics with plenty of ammunition yet for all his ability to spark controversy chamberlain could get the job done on the court and the
