furious and then be done in an hour dwhere i live i suspect we have thunderstorms forecast for every day in august as well as part of july report inappropriate contentreadingmichaelreading uk level

the nearest we saw was literallly 10 seconds of light rain the whole week it was sunny and humid all week report inappropriate contentgermondsny level contributor373 posts save reply5 re current weather aug 22 2008 812 ammany people misread the weather channels 10 day forecast when they put up an icon that says isolated or scattered thundershowers you need to look two columns to the right for the relevant percentage currently that column says 30 or 40 percent this means there is a 30 or 40 percent of a thundershower at some point during the 24hour period of that day conversely it also means there is a 60 or 70 percent chance there will be no precipitation during the same 24hour period and the adjectives isolated and scattered mean any shower systems are small therefore rain durations brief in other words the overwhelming probability is that it will not be raining most of the time you are there and you will see plenty of sunshine that is the typical summer pattern on isla mujeres and that is the forecast for the next seven days report inappropriate content whaaustintexas austin texas3 posts save reply6 re current weather aug 22 2008 117 pmthanks to all for the input

27 2008 523 pmhaving grown up on the subtropical se us coast i love how scattered summer thunderstorms tend to scatter the crowds away from the beach leaving it relatively empty for the rest of us what i am worried about though is hurricane gustav which seems to be heading in that general direction for labor day weekend really im hoping it dissipates but i remember katrina was a little ole cat 1 at one point too so one never can tell what nature has in store for us is anyone altering their travel plans for this yet anyone know what the word on the street is the palabra on the calle report

within the cone of uncertainty  in other words the possible track of gustav with arrival anticipated between 2 am saturday and sunday morning the intensity of the storm is expected to increase as it feeds on the warm caribbean waters one of the computer models takes the eye of the storm over the western end of cuba which would have minimal effect on isla the other models take it through the yucatan channel and that track would definitely affect the island with at least high surf and tropical storm force winds property managers have begun to take protective measures especially for waterfront homes on the eastern windward side of the island but there is no touristevacuation order in effect yet that could change within the next 48 hours as the storms path becomes clearer in the gulf of mexico gustav will become a serious hurricane threat to the us mentioned in this post caribbean north america report inappropriate content katlanta atlanta galevel contributor252 posts154
