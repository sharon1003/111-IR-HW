quick reverse tiedyeby bitsi in fashion download 3 steps share favorite i made itcollection this could possibly be the fastest and easiest way to tiedye a shirt ever i found these navy and black tees on sale and i loved the fit but i thought that they were a little plain i wanted to jazz them up a little but in a subtle way so that i could still wear them under a jacket or with jewelry typically if you want to tiedye something you have to let the dye set for 68 hours with this method you can be done in less than ten minutes using bleach in a spray bottle i was able to control how much of the shirt was altered and how much color was removed step 1 supplies and stuff you will needa clean dark tee shirt  the darker the bettera spray bottlesome rubber bandsbleacha bleachproof space put a little bleach in your spray bottle label the bottle so that you dont accidentally mistake it for hair spray some day arrange your tee in your bleachproof space i have a plastic mannequin set up on my work table but you can just lay it flat on some plastic bags these two instructables may give you some ideas for layouts 1 transforming a boring old black tshirt using bleach 2 bleach spritz clothing step 2 dont you hate delayed gratification now this is going to happen fast so dont blink or stop to check your email gently mist your tee shirt like magic every where that a drop of bleach touches color is removed black turns brown and navy turns pink how does this happen according to httpwwwhowstuffworkscomquestion189htmwhen you buy a gallon of bleach at the grocery store what you are buying is the chemical sodium hypochlorite mixed with water in a 525percent solution youre buying salt water that has been changed slightly by electricity natural stains as well as dyes produced by everything from mildew to grass come from chemical compounds called chromophores chromophores can absorb light at specific wavelengths and therefore cause colors when chlorine reacts with water it produces hydrochloric acid and atomic oxygen the oxygen reacts easily with the chromophores to eliminate the portion of its structure that causes the color i understood that completely didnt you anyway the more bleach you use and the longer you leave on the more color is removed so for subtle effects mist lightly and go to the next step quickly on the example photos i misted the black tee lightly and in an irregular pattern for the navy blue tee i went for a more dramatic tiedye effect by tying rosettes into the fabric using rubber bands i also sprayed more heavily step 3 and youre doneto stop the chemical reaction rinse and wash your tee immediately i just dumped mine in the kitchen sink with a little dish soap its ready to wear when dry comments we have a be nice comment

the damage the bleach will inflict on the fabric itself over time when doing discharge dyeing the bleach has to be neutralized two ways to do this one is to buy a product called antichlor or you can use white vinegar be sure to rinse the fabric well in plain water and then place it in the vinegar bath for about 1520 minutes then wash as usual the vinegar is not as effective as the antichlor but is better than nothing you can also find a product in pet stores that is used for neutralizing the chlorine in a fish tank that will work too the main thing is to stop the bleach from eating the fabric over time whatever method you choose to use the bleach should be rinsed out first before going to the neutralizing step in discharge dyeing classes the bleach is never used full strength the strongest we use is 5050 with water many instructors go with a 30 bleach solution to 70 water darth maker crystal dyes reply20110828hydrogen peroxide is what is suggested in another reverse tyedie instructable crystal dyes darth maker reply20110829peroxide does work but can wind up being somewhat expensive because you need a fresh bottle each time you use it peroxide degrades very quickly once it is opened and exposed to air there is also the issue that it too can affect some colors the vinegar is cheaper than peroxide but in reality antichlor is the cheapest it comes as a powder and you only use a teaspoon or two of the stuff to a 5 gallon bucket it can be purchased thru dharma trading on the west coast and thru pro chemical on the east coast if kept stored in a temperature controlled environment it can last indefinitely im still using some i bought years ago there are lots of ideas for dyeingdischarge dyeing available on the net some have great safe instructions some do not if youre only doing this once in awhile home remedies are probably okay but for someone who decides to do it on a regular basis safety is paramount pro chemical wwwprochemicalcom has a vast amount
