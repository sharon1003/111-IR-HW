often poached but steaming frying and stewing all make appearances as well mole pipian and adobo according to smith hurd there are three great sauces in poblano cooking mole pipian and adobo any proper discussion about pueblan cuisine begins with mole poblano considered by many to be mexicos national dish probably invented by the nuns of santa clara it is powered by chilies wouldnt be the dish it is today without the addition of global ingredients like almonds from spain plantains from africa and cinnamon from asia as it can take days to make its generally reserved for special occasions like weddings each cook has their own recipe of vary complexity depending on whos behind the stove it might be smokier sweeter earthier or spicier while the roster of ingredients fluctuates youll always find dried chilies like mulatto pasilla and ancho a light dose of chocolate nuts for thickening and toasted sesame seeds for garnishing spices like allspice and canela and fresh and dried fruit including plantains and raisins while oaxaca is famously said to have seven moles puebla continues to be defined by mole poblano alone but thats hardly all the state has to offer many more exist in puebla including mole de chilayo made with sesame seed red jalapeno and white beans mole verde de zacapala made with pumpkin seeds lettuce chilcotes and local runner beans the second of pueblas great sauces is pipian hallmarked by the precolumbian technique of browning seeds to release their fat and then grinding them into an oily paste in puebla the most popular form is verde made with pepitas spices broth and fresh chilies but the totonocs in the north also make pipian blanco with coriander and peanuts pollo en adobo rojo in adobo meat is marinated in chilies and vinegar for adobo rojo dried chilies like guajillo and ancho chilies are typical while the more tart brighter verde uses tomatillos jalapenos and serranos stuffed chilies saucy meats and soups photograph blake royerpueblan cooks are fond of stuffing and frying their poblano chilies which is the makings of one of the states tastiest dishes the baroque masterpiece chiles en nogada a celebration of the fall bounty the dish features a picadillo a stuffing or hash of finely chopped meat seasoned with apples peaches pears and dried fruit stuffed inside a roasted poblano chili the stuffed chili is then fried in lard drowned in a creamy walnut sauce and garnished with parsley and pomegranate seeds for a white green and red tableau reminiscent of the mexican flag as a seasonal and laborious specialty chiles en nogada arent an everyday dish more common foods fill the stuffedpepper gap like chiles rellenos battered and fried poblanos stuffed with simpler fillings like oozy cheese and chiltamale a pepper stuffed with a fresh corn tamale pueblans are bold braisers cooking meat in all manner of chili nut tomato and tomatillo sauces these preparations typically fit specific purposes tinga chicken

whole animal typically sheep or goat is wrapped in maguey leaves maybe seasoned with aromatics like avocado leaves and roasted like all of central mexico puebla claims the dish as its own soupstews a term coined by diana kennedy to refer to dishes like pozole that dont fit neatly into either category are integral to the cuisines of central mexico and bridge a direct link to the precolumbian vegetarian chilli stew chillmoli in puebla smith hurd says they constitute the other half of the mole equation two such preparations are mole de olla a beef chili and vegetable stew and mole de caderas literally hips the most fascinating of pueblas other moles all about puebla details its humble agricultural origins as the recipe calls for off cuts like the hips bones and spines of goats cooked with ingredients like runner beans wild tamarind seeds and local chilies that nosetotail tradition continues to this today photograph chris crowleyas elsewhere in mexico the soup course is essential to comida or lunch the main meal of the day this may come in the form of a sopa seca casseroles and other dry bean rice and pasta courses or cremas smooth vegetable purees that highlight regional produce like pueblas poblano peppers the spicy corn chowder chileatole is a rustic classic while meatier soups include albondigas en chipotle or eggstuffed pork meatballs in chipotle broth street snacks and sandwiches chalupas what about antojitos mexicans have a sophisticated nomenclature for their masa snacks—many minor variations on a theme—that matches the italian language for pasta awed by the stupendous variety of these snacks diana kennedy once called mexicans the most persistent noshers in the world generally speaking masa snacks fall into two broad categories those that are stuffed and those that are topped most are grilled or shallowfried but deep frying and steaming have their place theyre typically served early in the morning like tamales with atole for commuters or later in the night like tacos to fill in the gaps between the main meal others are foods of practicality like tacos placeros market tacos a cheap but robust meal folded into a tortilla while antojitos were enjoyed in precolumbian times many modern varieties would not exist without the ingredients and techniques introduced by the spanish theres the lard in your tamale the oil used to fry your tostada and so on some modern snacks remain relatively faithful to their prehispanic forms like central mexicos famous tlacoyos often but not always torpedo shaped these grilled antojitos are stuffed with fillings like beans or requeson and traditionally topped with nothing but salsa despite being grouped into the catchall of street food not all are found on the street or in markets some are the province of restaurants and in puebla street food is more likely to be served out of stalls than on the curb each region of mexico has their own unique antojitos puebla can lay claim to the sierra nortes pinots thick bean stuffed tortillas dipped in tomato salsa and memelas poblanas masa boats that are a popular morning appetizer the regional spin on fried tortilla shells chalupas are served through to the afternoon while molotes like deep fried masa calzones filled with anything from plantains to brains are often enjoyed at night street food is an easy point of entry for immigrants and their influence is evident in tacos arabes deemed the taco of puebla by smith hurd the creation of either lebanese or iraqi immigrants tacos arabes are made with pork seasoned with a chipotle sauce and cooked in the style of shawarma they are unlike the related tacos al pastor served on pan arabe not all snacks are made of masa though puebla is home to some of the worlds finest sandwiches everybody whos anybody knows the towering cemita what with its frijoles en chipotle pungent papalo and stringy quesillo but there are also chanclas stuffed with shredded beef avocado and onion and drenched in guajillo sauce pelonas a small roll fried and then overstuffed with crema salsa shredded beef and avocado and the guajalote crispyfried torta de agua bread with crema salsa and shredded turkey beverages and sweets rompope photograph maria del mar sacasasweets in mexico were forever changed by the introduction of refined sugar the frozen treats and candied fruit and tubers like camotes en dulce enjoyed throughout central mexico are a legacy of that but puebla also has its own heritage of creative elaborate desserts created by the convent nuns baroque sauces werent all they gave puebla some are more transparently european like muéganos or nougat while others like camotes de santa clara flavored sweet potato candies blur lines a particularly unique aspect of this heritage is the pumpkin seed icing invented by the same nuns and used on sweets like the shortbread cookies tortitas de santa clara that same icing is used for pueblas beloved mollotes dulce the states custardfilled sweet bread the states drinks exhibit both ancient and colonial influences for imbibing there is rompope the eggnog variant created by the nuts and a variety of fruit wines and liqueurs like the raisinbased pasita are enjoyed but beverages arent all fun many are important to and associated with holiday celebrations ponce a fruit cocktail anchored by tejocote is prepared for the day of the dead and christmas while atole though a typical street food is often associated with christmas found throughout mexico the ancient masabased porridge is made in puebla plain or with chocolate
