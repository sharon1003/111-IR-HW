associate it with devilthe mountains and hills are this creature’s domains depending on part of ireland you lived in pooka was thought to be either helpful or menacing it has been known to help

known for its cunning and wile as well as lies and deception pooka’s archetype is trickster it is also a fertility spirit since it has power to create or destroy as well as ability of human speech it is a gifted prophesier3november is month of pooka in ireland of past at halloween many children went out “with pooka” but others stayed indoors fearful of stories they had heard of what pooka did to children in popular culture other iconic mystical creatures are incarnated from pooka for example bogeyman is derived from pooka also easter bunny which is pagan in origin fairylike creature that brings chocolate eggs and sweets to children at easter has its roots in fertility spirit theme of pooka in film harvey 1950 directed by henry koster giant white bunny was inspired by pooka this mythic creature is also well documented in classic literature of ireland and britain irish poet and playwright w b yeats depicts pooka as an eagle while irish novelist and playwright brian o’nolan who wrote under pseudonym flann o’brien was also so inspired o’brien’s masterpiece at swimtwobirds features a character called pooka mac phillemey a “member of devil class” in william shakespeare’s a midsummer night’s dream puck is a mischievous and quickwitted sprite responsible for setting many of play’s events in motion through his magic often appearing as a horse pooka sometimes gallops across countryside knocking down fences and gates and destroying crops in this form pooka likes to take a rider usually a drunkard on a wild ride all night and shake him off in grey of morning this person already heavily inebriated is also under spell of pooka and has no recollection of what happened this often accounts for way some people who having gotten very drunk report that they have no idea what happened previous night the only man to ever successfully ride a pooka was high king of ireland and founder of o’brien dynasty brian boruma mac cennetig 9411014 or more commonly known as brian boru brian managed to control magic of creature by using a special bridle which used three hairs of pooka’s tail brian’s physical prowess meant he was able to stay on its back until exhausted pooka surrendered to brian3the king forced it to agree to two promises first that it no longer tormented christian people and ruined their property and second that it would never again attack an irishman except those who were drunk or were abroad with evil intent although pooka agreed it appears to have forgotten its promises over years remember pooka’s overlord – the prince of lies past history records many sightings of pooka all over country but most famous story is animal spirit that gave its name to poulaphuca hole of pooka at boundary of river liffey between counties kildare and wicklow presently this is site of a hydroelectric power station where river flows through a narrow gorge before plunging 150 feet 46 meters in three stages under second drop there is a pool and this is called hole of pooka irish author padraig o’farrell 19322004 narrates this story which was inspired by written account of an anonymous kildare man the writer also has an interesting postscript at end“in november 1813 kildare hunt known as killing kildares set out having indulged in traditional stirrup cup at tipper crossroads near naas hunt failed to raise a fox until it was approaching tipperkevin north of ballymore eustace county kildare here a large fox appeared and led a course towards liffey simultaneously an unmounted black horse appeared that did not belong to any of riders it was pooka the terrain was difficult and fox ran fast so that near liffey only one of members of hunt a man named grennan and horse who was really pooka remained with pack the gorge was in full spate but hounds were gaining on their quarry and started to pick their way across rocks seeing danger grennan attempted to recall hounds but pooka ahead of them was tempting them onwards the fox headed for ledge on narrow part of gorge then seeing pooka’s red eyes spitting fire fox jumped it missed ledge falling into turbulent waters below the pooka easily leaped across gorge disappearing into woodlands but pack of hounds hard on scent of fox went headlong into pool looking down grennan saw fox and hounds trying desperately to swim to safety through swirling swell other hounds dashed against rocks were yelping in pain and dying he wept as most of pack went under suddenly his sorrow give way to terror he heard a diabolical neighing like an animal laughing – from woods opposite grennan knew then it was pooka the writer of original story describes how in 1930s as he stood above valleys of liffey and king’s river a sudden sadness came over him and he wept at sight of so many humble homes which would soon be submerged forever by blessington lakes created to supply water for power station at poulaphuca between 1938 and 1940 seventysix houses were demolished and bridges at humphreystown baltyboys and burgage were blown up before entire valley was flooded for hydroelectric power station a protestant church st mark’s built in 1682 was also submerged to this day there have been many claims of people hearing bells tolling beneath waters of lakes lest you think that pooka is just another myth from irish history – think again the pooka exists in contemporary ireland also for example it has a strong resonance with events of recent past and not just symbolically either remember the pooka is always around just before disaster cork born folklorist thomas crofton croker in fairy legends and traditions 1825 alleges that pooka does appear as a real flesh and blood person apparently pooka in a human guise approaches someone inveigles its way into their company and subsequently predicts unfortunate events that would befall them of course when adversity does strike this entity is never around hidden in its supernatural realm it revels in joy of watching humans enduring effects of catastrophic events for example consider this report recorded by folklorist owen harding in july 2011 on wednesday 1st november 2006 about 730pm denis o’rourke a business man and investor originally from cork city but then living in malahide county dublin believes he met pooka a strange and welldressed man was outside of front gate of denis’s home this man struck up a conversation with denis claiming he had known him for years he went on to tell denis about his family – true facts he could not have known going back three generations and how over years they had lost and gained money this man who did not give a name also said that family finances were based on more than just heritage they were also subject to greater economy of a nation over next couple of years o’rourke witnessed not merely fiscal fall of country but his own financial ruin including his business his family home and two other houses he had invested in harding alleges that there are many similar reports and possibly many more from others who are too embarrassed to reveal them the problem harding claims is that many people are not aware that anything unusual has happened until after pooka has left not only that but when disaster does happen pooka like t s eliott’s elusive cat macavity “is not there” macavity is celebrated in a poem by eliot as mystery cat musical cats is based on poem10sharesfacebook email twitter more comment read this next best of ireland11 places in ireland you have to visit36372
