increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death opportunistic infections due to bacterial mycobacterial invasive fungal viral parasitic or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis blastomycosis candidiasis coccidioidomycosis histoplasmosis legionellosis listeriosis pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with tnf blockers patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease treatment with cimzia should not be initiated in patients with an active infection including clinically important localized infections patients greater than 65 years of age patients with comorbid conditions andor patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants eg corticosteroids or methotrexate may be at a greater risk of infection the risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patientswith chronic or recurrent infectionwho have been exposed to tuberculosiswith a history of an opportunistic infectionwho have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses such as histoplasmosis coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosiswith underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection tuberculosis cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving cimzia including patients who have previously or concomitantly received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary ie disseminated tuberculosis evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating cimzia and periodically during therapy cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving cimzia including patients who have previously or concomitantly received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary ie disseminated tuberculosis evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating cimzia and periodically during therapy treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with tnfblocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy prior to initiating cimzia assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed and consider an induration of 5 mm or greater a positive tuberculin skin test result even for patients previously vaccinated with bacille calmetteguerin bcg consider antituberculosis therapy prior to initiation of cimzia in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection despite previous or concomitant treatment for latent tuberculosis cases of active tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with cimzia some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with cimzia consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision of whether initiating antituberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient strongly consider tuberculosis in patients who develop a new infection during cimzia treatment especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis strongly consider tuberculosis in patients who develop a new infection during cimzia treatment especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis monitoring patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with cimzia including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with cimzia cimzia should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with cimzia should be closely monitored undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated invasive fungal infections for patients who reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic invasive fungal infection should be suspected if they develop a serious systemic illness appropriate empiric antifungal therapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection when feasible the decision to administer empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections and should take into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and risks of antifungal therapy malignancies in the controlled portions of clinical studies of some tnf blockers more cases of malignancies have been observed among patients receiving tnf blockers compared to

been reported among children adolescents and young adults who received treatment with tnfblocking agents initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age of which cimzia is a member approximately half the cases were lymphomas including hodgkins and nonhodgkins lymphoma the other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents the malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy range 1 to 84 months most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants these cases were reported postmarketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports cimzia is not indicated for use in pediatric patients malignancies some fatal have been reported among children adolescents and young adults who received treatment with tnfblocking agents initiation of therapy ≤ 18

observed among patients receiving tnf blockers compared to control patients in controlled studies of cimzia for crohns disease and other investigational uses there was one case of lymphoma among 2657 cimziatreated patients and one case of hodgkins lymphoma among 1319 placebotreated patients in the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the tnf blockers more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving tnf blockers compared to control patients in controlled studies of cimzia for crohns disease and other investigational uses there was one case of lymphoma among 2657 cimziatreated patients and one case of hodgkins lymphoma among 1319 placebotreated patients in the cimzia ra clinical trials placebocontrolled and open label a total of three cases of lymphoma were observed among 2367 patients this is approximately 2fold higher than expected in the general population patients with ra particularly those with highly active disease are at a higher risk for the development of lymphoma in the cimzia ra clinical trials placebocontrolled and open label a total of three cases of lymphoma were observed among 2367 patients this is approximately 2fold higher than expected in the general population patients with ra particularly those with highly active disease are at a higher risk for the development of lymphoma rates in clinical studies for cimzia cannot be compared to the rates of clinical trials of other tnf blockers and may not predict the rates observed when cimzia is used in a broader patient population patients with crohns disease that require chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies may be at higher risk than the general population for the development of lymphoma even in the absence of tnf blocker therapy  the potential role of tnf blocker therapy in the development of malignancies in adults is not known rates in clinical studies for cimzia cannot be compared to the rates of clinical trials of other tnf blockers and may not predict the rates observed when cimzia is used in a broader patient population patients with crohns disease that require chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies may be at higher risk than the general population for the development of lymphoma even in the absence of tnf blocker therapy see adverse reactions 61  the potential role of tnf blocker therapy in the development of malignancies in adults is not known postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic tcell lymphoma hstcl a rare type of tcell lymphoma that has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal have been reported in patients treated with tnf blockers including cimzia the majority of reported tnf blocker cases occurred in adolescent and young adult males with crohns disease or ulcerative colitis almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine andor 6mercaptopurine 6mp concomitantly with a tnf blocker at or prior to diagnosis it is uncertain whether the occurrence of hstcl is related to use of a tnf blocker or a tnf blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants the potential risk of using a tnf blocker in combination with azathioprine or 6mp should be carefully considered postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic tcell lymphoma hstcl a rare type of tcell lymphoma that has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal have been reported in patients treated with tnf blockers including cimzia the majority of reported tnf blocker cases occurred in adolescent and young adult males with crohns disease or ulcerative colitis almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine andor 6mercaptopurine 6mp concomitantly with a tnf blocker at or prior to diagnosis it is uncertain whether the occurrence of hstcl is related to use of a tnf blocker or a tnf blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants the potential risk of using a tnf blocker in combination with azathioprine or 6mp should be carefully considered cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with postmarketing tnfblocker use in ra and other indications even in the absence of tnfblocker therapy patients with ra may be at a higher risk approximately 2fold than the general population for the development of leukemia cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with postmarketing tnfblocker use in ra and other indications even in the absence of tnfblocker therapy patients with ra may be at a higher risk approximately 2fold than the general population for the development of leukemia melanoma and merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with tnfantagonists including cimzia periodic skin examinations are recommended for all patients particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer heart failure cases of worsening congestive heart failure chf and new onset chf have been reported with tnf blockers including cimzia cimzia has not been formally studied in patients with chf however in clinical studies in patients with chf with another tnf blocker worsening congestive heart failure chf and increased mortality due to chf were observed exercise caution in patients with heart failure and monitor them carefully see adverse reactions 61  hypersensitivity reactions the following symptoms that could be compatible with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported rarely following cimzia administration to patients angioedema dyspnea hypotension rash serum sickness and urticaria some of these reactions occurred after the first administration of cimzia if such reactions occur discontinue further administration of cimzia and institute appropriate therapy there are no data on the risks of using cimzia in patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction towards another tnf blocker in these patients caution is needed see adverse reactions 61  hepatitis b virus reactivation use of tnf blockers including cimzia has been associated with reactivation of hepatitis b virus hbv in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus in some instances hbv reactivation occurring in conjunction with tnf blocker therapy has been fatal the majority of reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system which may also contribute to hbv reactivation test patients for hbv infection before initiating treatment with cimzia for patients who test positive for hbv infection consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis b is recommended adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of hbv with antiviral therapy in conjunction with tnf blocker therapy to prevent hbv reactivation patients who are carriers of hbv and require treatment with cimzia should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active hbv infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy in patients who develop hbv reactivation discontinue cimzia and initiate effective antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment the safety of resuming tnf blocker therapy after hbv reactivation is controlled is not known therefore exercise caution when considering resumption of cimzia therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely neurologic reactions use of tnf blockers of which cimzia is a member has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms andor radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and with peripheral demyelinating disease including guillainbarré syndrome exercise caution in considering the use of cimzia in patients with preexisting or recentonset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders rare cases of neurological disorders including seizure disorder optic neuritis and peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients treated with cimzia see adverse reactions 61  hematological reactions rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with tnf blockers adverse reactions of the hematologic system including medically significant cytopenia eg leukopenia pancytopenia thrombocytopenia have been infrequently reported with cimzia see adverse reactions 61  the causal relationship of these events to cimzia remains unclear although no high risk group has been identified exercise caution in patients being treated with cimzia who have ongoing or a history of significant hematologic abnormalities advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection eg persistent fever bruising bleeding pallor while on cimzia consider discontinuation of cimzia therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities use with biological diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs biological dmardsserious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra an interleukin1 antagonist and another tnf blocker etanercept with no added benefit compared to etanercept alone a higher risk of serious infections was also observed in combination use of tnf blockers with abatacept and rituximab because of the nature of the adverse events seen with this combination therapy similar toxicities may also result from the use of cimzia in this combination therefore the use of cimzia in combination with other biological dmards is not recommended see drug interactions 71  autoimmunity treatment with cimzia may result in the formation of autoantibodies and rarely in the development of a lupuslike syndrome if a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupuslike syndrome following treatment with cimzia discontinue treatment see adverse reactions 61  immunizations patients treated with cimzia may receive vaccinations except for live or live attenuated vaccines no data are available on the response to live vaccinations or the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving cimzia in a placebocontrolled clinical trial of patients with rheumatoid arthritis no difference was detected in antibody response to vaccine between cimzia and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with cimzia similar proportions of patients developed protective levels of antivaccine antibodies between cimzia and placebo treatment groups however patients receiving cimzia and concomitant methotrexate had a lower humoral response compared with patients receiving cimzia alone the clinical significance of this is unknown immunosuppression since tnf mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses the possibility exists for tnf blockers including cimzia to affect host defenses against infections and malignancies the impact of treatment with cimzia on the development and course of malignancies as well as active andor chronic infections is not fully understood see warnings and precautions 51 52 55 and adverse reactions 61  the safety and efficacy of cimzia in patients with immunosuppression has not been formally evaluated adverse reactions clinical trials experience the most serious adverse reactions were serious infections see warnings and precautions 51malignancies see warnings and precautions 52heart failure see warnings and precautions 53because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying and controlled conditions adverse reaction rates observed in clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not predict

treatment groups compared to the placebo groups 006 per patientyear for all cimzia doses vs 002 per patientyear for placebo rates of serious infections in the 200 mg every other week dose group were 006 per patientyear and in the 400 mg every 4 weeks dose group were 004 per patientyear serious infections included tuberculosis pneumonia cellulitis and pyelonephritis in the placebo group no serious infection occurred in more than one subject there is no evidence of increased risk of infections with continued exposure over time see warnings and precautions 51  tuberculosis and opportunistic infections in completed and ongoing global clinical studies in all indications including 5118 cimziatreated patients the overall rate of tuberculosis is approximately 061 per 100 patientyears across all indications the majority of cases occurred in countries with high endemic rates of tb reports include cases of miliary lymphatic peritoneal as well as pulmonary tb the median time to onset of tb for all patients exposed to cimzia across all indications was 345 days in the studies with cimzia in ra there were 36 cases of tb among 2367 exposed patients including some fatal cases rare cases of opportunistic infections have also been reported in these clinical trials see warnings and precautions 51  malignancies in clinical studies of cimzia the overall incidence rate of malignancies was similar for cimziatreated and control patients for some tnf blockers more cases of malignancies have been observed among patients receiving those tnf blockers compared to control patients see warnings

reduction of drug plasma concentration which represents 17 152903 of the study population the data from these two studies do not suggest an association between the development of antibodies and adverse events the overall percentage of patients with antibodies to certolizumab pegol detectable on at least one occasion was 7 105 of 1509 in the rheumatoid arthritis placebocontrolled trials approximately one third 3 39 of 1509 of these patients had antibodies with neutralizing activity in vitro patients treated with concomitant immunosuppressants mtx had a lower rate of antibody

formation overall than patients treated with cimzia monotherapy in raiv 2 vs 8 both the loading dose of 400 mg every other week at weeks 0 2 and 4 and concomitant use of mtx were associated with reduced immunogenicity antibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration and reduced efficacy in patients receiving the recommended cimzia dosage of 200 mg every other week with concomitant mtx the acr20 response was lower among antibody positive patients than among antibodynegative patients study rai 48 versus 60 study raii 35 versus 59 respectively in study raiii too few patients developed antibodies to allow for meaningful analysis of acr20 response by antibody status in study raiv monotherapy the acr20 response was 33 versus 56 antibodypositive versus antibodynegative status respectively see clinical pharmacology 123  no association was seen between antibody development and the development of adverse events the data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to certolizumab pegol in an elisa and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay the observed incidence of antibody including neutralizing antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity assay methodology sample handling timing of sample collection concomitant medications and underlying disease for these reasons comparison of the incidence of antibodies to certolizumab pegol with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading hypersensitivity reactions the following symptoms that could be compatible with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported rarely following cimzia administration to patients angioedema dermatitis allergic dizziness postural dyspnea hot flush hypotension injection site reactions malaise pyrexia rash serum sickness and vasovagal syncope see warnings and precautions 54  postmarketing experience the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of cimzia because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure vascular disorder systemic vasculitis has been identified during postapproval use of tnf blockers skin case of severe skin reactions including stevensjohnson syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis erythema multiforme and new or worsening psoriasis all subtypes including pustular and palmoplantar have been identified during postapproval use of tnf blockers immune system disorders sarcoidosis neoplasms benign malignant and unspecified including cysts and polyps melanoma merkel cell carcinoma neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin see warnings and precautions 52  drug interactions use with anakinra abatacept rituximab and natalizumab an increased risk of serious infections has been seen in clinical studies of other tnfblocking agents used in combination with anakinra or abatacept with no added benefit formal drug interaction studies have not been performed with rituximab or natalizumab because of the nature of the adverse events seen with these combinations with tnf blocker therapy similar toxicities may also result from the use of cimzia in these combinations there is not enough information to assess the safety and efficacy of such combination therapy therefore the use of cimzia in combination with anakinra abatacept rituximab or natalizumab is not recommended see warnings and precautions 58  live vaccines avoid use of live including attenuated vaccines concurrently with cimzia see warnings and precautions 510  laboratory tests interference with certain coagulation assays has been detected in patients treated with cimzia certolizumab pegol may cause erroneously elevated activated partial thromboplastin time a ptt assay results in patients without coagulation abnormalities this effect has been observed with the pttlupus anticoagulant la test and standard target activated partial thromboplastin time staptt automate tests from diagnostica stago and the hemos il apttsp liquid and hemos il lyophilized silica tests from instrumentation laboratories other a ptt assays may be affected as well interference with thrombin time tt and prothrombin time pt assays has not been observed there is no evidence that cimzia therapy has an effect on in vivo coagulation use in specific populationspregnancy pregnancy exposure registry there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to cimzia during pregnancy for more information healthcare providers or patients can contact mother to baby pregnancy studies conducted by the organization of teratology information specialists otis the otis auto immune diseases study at 18773118972 or visit httpmothertobabyorgpregnancystudiesrisk summary limited data from the ongoing pregnancy registry on use of cimzia in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a risk of major birth defects or other adverse pregnancy outcomes certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations obtained from 10 women treated with cimzia during pregnancy and their newborn infants demonstrated low placental transfer of certolizumab pegol cimzia may be eliminated at a slower rate in exposed infants than in adult patients see data  there are risks to the mother and fetus associated with active rheumatoid arthritis or crohns disease the theoretical risks of administration of live or liveattenuated vaccines to the infants exposed in utero to cimzia should be weighed against the benefits of vaccinations see clinical considerations  no adverse developmental effects were observed in animal reproduction studies during which pregnant rats were administered intravenously a rodent antimurine tnfα pegylated fab fragment c tn3 pf similar to certolizumab pegol during organogenesis at up to 24 times the recommended human dose of 400 mg per month the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population s are unknown all pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect loss or other adverse outcomes in the u s general population the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 24 and 1520 respectively clinical considerations diseaseassociated maternal andor embryofetal risk published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis or crohns disease is correlated with maternal disease activity and that active disease increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including fetal loss preterm delivery before 37 weeks of gestation low birth weight 2500 g and small for gestational age birth fetalneonatal adverse reactions due to its inhibition of tnfα cimzia administered during pregnancy could affect immune responses in the in utero exposed newborn and infant although certolizumab pegol levels were low in 12 infants exposed to cimzia in utero the clinical significance of these low levels is unknown additional data available from one exposed infant suggests that cimzia may be eliminated at a slower rate in infants than in adults see data  the safety of administering live or liveattenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown data human data a limited number of pregnancies have been reported in the ongoing pregnancy exposure registry due to the small number of cimziaexposed pregnancies with known outcomes n23 no meaningful comparisons between the exposed group and control groups may be conducted to determine an association with cimzia and major birth defects or adverse pregnancy outcomes in an independent clinical study conducted in 10 pregnant women with crohn´s disease treated with cimzia certolizumab pegol concentrations were measured in maternal blood as well as in cord and infant blood n12 at the day of birth the last dose of cimzia 400 mg for every mother was given on average 19 days prior to delivery range 542 days plasma certolizumab pegol concentrations were 041 –166 μgm l in cord blood 041 – 158 μgm l in infant blood and 187–5957 μgm l in maternal blood plasma certolizumab pegol concentrations were lower by at least 75 in the infants than in mothers suggesting low placental transfer of certolizumab pegol in one infant the plasma certolizumab pegol concentration declined from 102 to 084 μg m l over 4 weeks suggesting that cimzia may be eliminated at a slower rate in infants than adults animal data because certolizumab pegol does not crossreact with mouse or rat tnfα reproduction studies were performed in rats using a rodent antimurine tnfα pegylated fab fragment c tn3 pf similar to certolizumab pegol animal reproduction studies have been performed in rats during organogenesis at intravenous doses up to 100 mgkg about 24 times the recommended human dose of 400 mg based on the surface area and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to c tn3 pf lactation risk summary no data are available regarding the presence of certolizumab pegol in human milk the effects on the breast fed infant or the effects on milk production published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because certolizumab pegol is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract however if certolizumab pegol is transferred into human milk effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mothers clinical need for cimzia and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from cimzia or from the underlying maternal condition pediatric use safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established due to its inhibition of tnfα cimzia administered during pregnancy could affect immune responses in the in utero exposed newborn and infant see use in specific populations 81  geriatric use clinical studies of cimzia did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients population pharmacokinetic analyses of patients enrolled in cimzia clinical studies concluded that there was no apparent difference in drug concentration regardless of age because there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general use caution when treating the elderly with cimzia see warnings and precautions 51  overdosage the maximum tolerated dose of certolizumab pegol has not been established doses of up to 800 mg subcutaneous and 20 mgkg intravenous have been administered without evidence of doselimiting toxicities in cases of overdosage it is recommended that patients be monitored closely for any adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately cimzia description cimzia certolizumab pegol is a tnf blocker cimzia is a recombinant humanized antibody fab fragment with specificity for human tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfα conjugated to an approximately 40k da polyethylene glycol peg2mal40k the fab fragment is manufactured in e coli and is subsequently subjected to purification and conjugation to peg2mal40k to generate certolizumab pegol the fab fragment is composed of a light chain with 214 amino acids and a heavy chain with 229 amino acids the molecular weight of certolizumab pegol is approximately 91 kilo daltons cimzia is supplied as either a sterile white lyophilized powder for solution or as a sterile solution in a singleuse prefilled 1 m l glass syringe for subcutaneous injection after reconstitution of the lyophilized powder with 1 m l sterile water for injection usp the resulting p h is approximately 52 each singleuse vial provides approximately 200 mg certolizumab pegol 09 mg lactic acid 01 mg polysorbate and 100 mg sucrose each singleuse prefilled syringe of cimzia delivers 200 mg in 1 m l of solution with a p h of approximately 47 for subcutaneous use each 1 m l syringe of cimzia contains certolizumab pegol 200 mg sodium acetate 136 mg sodium chloride 731 mg and water for injection usp cimzia is a clear to opalescent solution that is colorless to pale yellow and essentially free from particulates no preservatives are present cimzia  clinical pharmacology mechanism of action certolizumab pegol binds to human tnfα with a kd of 90p m tnfα is a key proinflammatory cytokine with a central role in inflammatory processes certolizumab pegol selectively neutralizes tnfα ic 90 of 4 ngm l for inhibition of human tnfα in the in vitro l929 murine fibrosarcoma cytotoxicity assay but does not neutralize lymphotoxin α tnfβ certolizumab pegol crossreacts poorly with tnf from rodents and rabbits therefore in vivo efficacy was evaluated using animal models in which human tnfα was the physiologically active molecule certolizumab pegol was shown to neutralize membraneassociated and soluble human tnfα in a dosedependent manner incubation of monocytes with certolizumab pegol resulted in a dosedependent inhibition of lpsinduced tnfα and il1β production in human monocytes certolizumab pegol does not contain a fragment crystallizable fc region which is normally present in a complete antibody and therefore does not fix complement or cause antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity in vitro it does not induce apoptosis in vitro in human peripheral bloodderived monocytes or lymphocytes nor does certolizumab pegol induce neutrophil degranulation a tissue reactivity study was carried out ex vivo to evaluate potential crossreactivity of certolizumab pegol with cryosections of normal human tissues certolizumab pegol showed no reactivity with a designated standard panel of normal human tissues pharmacodynamics biological activities ascribed to tnfα include the upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules and chemokines upregulation of major histocompatibility complex mhc class i and class ii molecules and direct leukocyte activation tnfα stimulates the production of downstream inflammatory mediators including interleukin1 prostaglandins platelet activating factor and nitric oxide elevated levels of tnfα have been implicated in the pathology of crohns disease and rheumatoid arthritis certolizumab pegol binds to tnfα inhibiting its role as a key mediator of inflammation tnfα is strongly expressed in the bowel wall in areas involved by crohns disease and fecal concentrations of tnfα in patients with crohns disease have been shown to reflect clinical severity of the disease after treatment with certolizumab pegol patients with crohns disease demonstrated a decrease in the levels of creactive protein crp increased tnfα levels are found in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients and play an important role in the joint destruction that is a hallmark of this disease pharmacokinetics absorption a total of 126 healthy subjects received doses of up to 800 mg certolizumab pegol subcutaneously sc and up to 10 mgkg intravenously iv in four pharmacokinetic studies data from these studies demonstrate that single intravenous and subcutaneous doses of certolizumab pegol have predictable doserelated plasma concentrations with a linear relationship between the dose administered and the maximum plasma concentration c max  and the area under the certolizumab pegol plasma concentration versus time curve auc a mean c max of approximately 43 to 49 mcgm l occurred at week 5 during the initial loading dose period using the recommended dose regimen for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis 400 mg sc at weeks 0 2 and 4 followed by 200 mg every other week certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations were broadly doseproportional and pharmacokinetics observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and crohns disease were consistent with those seen in healthy subjects following subcutaneous administration peak plasma concentrations of certolizumab pegol were attained between 54 and 171 hours postinjection certolizumab pegol has bioavailability f of approximately 80 ranging from 76 to 88 following subcutaneous administration compared to intravenous administration distribution the steady state volume of distribution vss was estimated as 6 to 8 l in the population pharmacokinetic analysis for patients with crohns disease and patients with rheumatoid arthritis metabolism the metabolism of certolizumab pegol has not been studied in human subjects data from animals indicate that once cleaved from the fab fragment the peg moiety is mainly excreted in urine without further metabolism elimination pegylation the covalent attachment of peg polymers to peptides delays the metabolism and elimination of these entities from the circulation by a variety of mechanisms including decreased renal clearance proteolysis and immunogenicity accordingly certolizumab pegol is an antibody fab fragment conjugated with peg in order to extend the terminal plasma elimination halflife t 12 of the fab the terminal elimination phase halflife t 12 was approximately 14 days for all doses tested the clearance following iv administration to healthy subjects ranged from 921 m lh to 1438 m lh the clearance following sc dosing was estimated 17 m lh in the crohns disease population pk analysis with an intersubject variability of 38 cv and an interoccasion variability of 16 similarly the clearance following sc dosing was estimated as 210 m lh in the ra population pk analysis with an intersubject variability of 308 cv and interoccasion variability 220 the route of elimination of certolizumab pegol has not been studied in human subjects studies in animals indicate that the major route of elimination of the peg component is via urinary excretion special populations population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted on data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and patients with crohns disease to evaluate the effect of age race gender methotrexate use concomitant medication creatinine clearance and presence of anticertolizumab antibodies on pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol only bodyweight and presence of anticertolizumab antibodies significantly affected certolizumab pegol pharmacokinetics pharmacokinetic exposure was inversely related to body weight but pharmacodynamic exposureresponse analysis showed that no additional therapeutic benefit would be expected from a weightadjusted dose regimen the presence of anticertolizumab antibodies was associated with a 36fold increase in clearance age pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol was not different in elderly compared to young adults gender pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol was similar in male and female subjects renal impairment specific clinical studies have not been performed to assess the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of cimzia the pharmacokinetics of the peg polyethylene glycol fraction of certolizumab pegol is expected to be dependent on renal function but has not been assessed in renal impairment there are insufficient data to provide a dosing recommendation in moderate and severe renal impairment race a specific clinical study showed no difference in pharmacokinetics between caucasian and japanese subjects drug interaction studies methotrexate pharmacokinetics is not altered by concomitant administration with cimzia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis the effect of methotrexate on cimzia pharmacokinetics was not studied however methotrexatetreated patients have lower incidence of antibodies to cimzia thus therapeutic plasma levels are more likely to be sustained when cimzia is administered with methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis formal drugdrug interaction studies have not been conducted with cimzia upon concomitant administration with corticosteroids nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs analgesics or immunosuppressants nonclinical toxicology carcinogenesis mutagenesis and impairment of fertility longterm animal studies of cimzia have not been conducted to assess its carcinogenic potential certolizumab pegol was not genotoxic in the ames test the human peripheral blood lymphocytes chromosomal aberration assay or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay since certolizumab pegol does not crossreact with mouse or rat tnfα reproduction studies were performed in rats using a rodent antimurine tnfα pegylated fab fragment c tn3 pf similar to certolizumab
