biomes are regions of the terrain in a minecraft world with varying geographical features elevation vegetation mobs temperature or sky color contents  showoverview introduced in the halloween update biomes separate every generated world into different environments paralleling the real world examples of biomes include the forests jungles deserts and tundras prior to the halloween update every world only had a single theme which was either grassy or snowy as of the latest version 112 there are 20 biomes in minecraft the term biome is analogous to its scientific usage on earth a biome is climatically and geographically defined by distinctive communities of plants animals and soil organisms supported by similar climatic conditions they are often referred to as ecosystems  biomes plains sunflower plains main article plains biome the plains biome was the first released biome in minecraft and covered the entire land it consisted of mainly grass and dirt trees were added later in the game then the release of ore block villages will also spwan here plains are the most basic of all lands but the easiest to obtain food due to grass seeds and the spawning of farm animals which are more abundant than in other biomes subtype sunflower plains sunflower plains are plains that produce a naturally occurring abundance of sunflowers they were added in 18  the bountiful update  forest main article forest biome the forest the forest biome mainly consists of trees the type of tree can vary but the oak tree is the most common type of tree in a forest subtype birch forest this biome only includes birch trees though some oak trees will appear in it it also looks much like a forest biome although none of the birch trees can be large like their oak variants however if the terrain happens to be hilly the birch trees can be extra tall subtype flower forest flower forests are forests with oak trees but have a variety of species of flowers scattered throughout the biome roofed forest dark foresta dark forest main article roofed forest biome the roofed forest biome features dark oak trees and huge mushrooms the roofed forest biome is a very dangerous biome for players as there are many dark places in the forest where hostile mobs are likely to spawn however it is more common than the mushroom biome which makes it an easier place to find giant mushrooms this is also where woodland mansions generate though this is very rare swamp a swamp main article swamp biome swamp biomes feature shallow bodies of discolored water and discolored grass with oak trees covered in vines slimes and witch huts can be found in swamps swamp biomes are the only natural source for lily pads which generate in water this is also the only biome that has naturallyoccurring blue orchids this is one of the easiest biomes to harvest clay in due to the large volume of shallow water which is where a player will most frequently find clay in minecraft pocket edition giant mushrooms will spawn in this biome as of the update 0100 and the water tends to be dark and murky jungle a jungle main article jungle a jungle is a very forested biome which looks similar to a tropical rainforest jungles have the tallest trees of any other biome similar to swamp biomes the trees are covered in vines this is the only biome where ocelots spawn a jungle may occasionally contain a jungle temple cocoa pods grow here and as of update 172 wild melons can also be found as of 112 parrots can also spawn here taiga the taiga a cold taiga variation main article taiga the taiga is a biome with denselyfilled spruce trees and dull greyblue grass hills are common and wolves may be found in this biome more frequently than in others spruce trees cover the landscape water will freeze into ice sugar cane can spawn here but it will break down due to the freezing of the ice the main difference between a taiga and a tundra is the amount of trees there are more in a taiga than in a tundra and the amount of snow there is more in a tundra than a taiga the grass in the taiga is sandgreen much like in the extreme hills subtype cold taiga contains densely filled spruce trees with lots of snow and ice mega taiga redwood foresta redwood forest main article megataiga biome the mega taiga biome is a subtype of the taiga biome with a mega spruce taiga variant it contains various blocks including podzol a variant of dirt also featured are 2x2 spruce trees along with ferns mushrooms and dead bushes this biome also features boulders made of moss stone that serve as a decorative purpose ice plains tundrathe tundra ice spike plains main article ice plains biome tundra biomes also known as ice plains are biomes completely covered in snow and have ice blocks due to water freezing breaking ice produces water spruce trees are found in this biome wolves can also spawn here snow falls here instead of rain subtype ice plains spikes  main article ice plains spikes biome ice spike plains are a variation of the ice plains but they are much rarer relatively few trees will grow in these plains large spikes of packed ice can be found throughout bodies of water will typically be frozen into packed ice as opposed to the tundras regular ice suggesting the ice plains spikes are severely colder villages that generate here will follow the taiga background spruce wood mesa mesa main article mesa biome the mesa biome features various colors of clay and natural terracotta that can be mined and dyed for decorating purposes also found in this biome is red sand which was implemented in update 17 other features included in this biome are dead bushes and the occasional cactus mesa biomes are rare and usually spawn near savanna biomes as of minecraft pocket edition s 0100 update gold ore can be found here at any level and there are aboveground mineshafts  desert a desert main article desert biome the desert biome is the most abundant source of cacti there are hills and small mountains made of sand and sandstone in the desert there are naturallyoccurring desert wells however these wells are rare desert temples can also spawn in large deserts as of update 13 villages in the desert are replaced with sandstone and smooth sandstone instead of the default oak wood materials savanna the savanna main article savanna biome this biome features dull dry grass and acacia trees npc villages can spawn naturally here along with horses it never rains in this biome and it often neighbors deserts or mesas llamas will also spawn here ocean the ocean main article ocean biome ocean biomes are extremely large expansive biomes consisting entirely of water far beneath the water is a landscape composed of gravel dirt and clay ocean biomes often flood into abandoned mine shafts or caves occasionally oceans have small twoblockwide air patches ocean biomes have no maximum size but they usually measure between 10000 and 25000 blocks wide occasionally in ocean biomes one can find small islands with little vegetation it is possible for players to spawn in ocean biomes on an island with no wood in the middle of the ocean making it extremely difficult to survive without the use of cheats subtype deep ocean deep ocean biomes are a variant of ocean biomes they are much deeper than regular ocean biomes the ocean floor consists of gravel they can be 30 blocks deep making underwater exploration dangerous however one may encounter light underwater which comes from abandoned mine shafts as of 18  the bountiful update deep ocean biomes generate ocean monuments surrounded by hostile guardians  as of 113  the oceans now have temperature and fishes dolphins and turtles will also spawn alongside with squids  mushroom islands mushroom islands main article mushroom island biome mushroom islands are a rare biome instead of dirt mushroom islands utilize mycelium mushroom islands are typically found far away from other land masses giant mushrooms grow in place of trees and the naturallyoccurring mobs are mooshrooms dirt placed on a mushroom island will eventually be turned into mycelium much like grass in other biomes farmland is resistant to mycelium change extreme hills main article extreme hills biome extreme hill biome unusual extreme hills formations a highlymountainous biome with dull greyblue grass and a few scattered oak trees cliffs peaks valleys waterfalls overhangs occasional lavafalls and many other structures exist creating outstanding views more underground cave systems are present here than in any other biome falling is a significant risk as there are many ledges and sudden drops often not visible and the drops can be large enough to cause severe fall damage or death extreme hills extreme hills edge and roofed forests are the only biomes where emerald ore spawns abundantly as of update 17 spruce trees spawn here as well in this biome if a mountain is high enough snow may cover the top of it worlds zonessee also category zones each of the biomes listed above generate exclusively within the overworld however there are areas of a minecraft world which are far larger but share similar characteristics to a biome they generate unique landscapes structures mobs etc the zones in this separate category can only be reached by using a specific method and typically have a brief loading screen when a player enters one they are in some ways considered as entirely separate worlds the overworld main article overworld the overworld is the primary zone in minecraft containing each of the biomes listed above this is the zone where players spawn and spend the majority of their gameplay the overworld the overworld is generated when creating a new seed with options including default superflat no biomes large biomes amplified data heavy  large mountains and hills that dwarf the default hilly biomes and customized which allows player to decide what structures generate more or less and to any extent desired the nether the nether main article the nether this biome is the nether dimension it is the first dimension that was released with the game this biome features more mobs and the nether fortress the only way to get to the nether is to build the portal made out of obsidian and light it with a flint and steel  one can also build another nether portal if the other one is destroyed but only if one has enough obsidian and a fire source lava is abundant and the floor is replaced with netherrack  sometimes lit on fire burning infinitely magma soul sand glowstone and occasionally gravel pits nether quartz can be mined and turned into decorative blocks maps can be made but they are useless as they are blank compasses and clocks do not work and will instead spin erratically beds placed in the nether explode when clicked on and they do the same amount of damage as lit tnt water can not be placed anywhere within the nether as it will immediately evaporate an exception is putting water into a cauldron  in this realm mobs that spawn naturally include ghasts zombie pigmen blazes magma cubes skeletons wither skeletons and endermen chickens can be spawned by throwing eggs which in turn can create zombie pigmen jockeys if a baby zombie pigman mounts a chicken the only generated structures here are nether fortresses lava pools and glowstone clusters the end the end main article the end the end is a series of floating islands in a black staticfilled void it is the second dimension that was added in update tu9 for consoles and 10 for all other releases in this zone the ground is replaced with end stone  the end features many endermen and the ender dragon boss the landscape is dotted with obsidian pillars topped with ender crystals which heal the ender dragon as a player does battle destroying these is key to defeating the dragon once in the end one can not return without either dying or defeating the ender dragon which opens the return portal this also finishes the game gameplay resumes as normal after the end credits in the end compasses clocks and beds do not work behaving the same way as they do in the nether an activated end portal to get to the end one will need to collect ender pearls from endermen in the overworld then one needs to create 12 eyes of ender using blaze powder and an ender pearl and locate a stronghold using the eyes of ender throw into the air and following their path some disappear so one will need many especially if the stronghold is far once in the stronghold a player must navigate the expansive ruins and locate the broken end portal frame be wary of silverfish which will spawn throughout as well as from a silverfish mob spawner which is located by the portal using the eyes of ender on the 12 portal frames will open the portal to the end it is also possible to build an end portal and activate it in the end on creative mode outer endend city end city main article end city the outer end is another part of the end with the main feature being one or more end cities one can get there by killing the ender dragon and then tossing an ender pearl through the oneblock portal that appears in the sky the outer end has many islands and like the end they are surrounded by the void chorus plants are the only vegetation native to this zone endermen and shulkers are common mobs within an end city an end city area can have several different types of towershaped structures and an end ship each filled with loot these cities are made of purpur blocks and end stone bricks which are exclusive to this zone trivia the advancement  adventuring time  can be achieved by visiting 36 predetermined biomes categories biomes overworld lists environment game terms game mechanics
