reviews whats the story in 1839 a group of africans sold into slavery were being transported to the united states on a spanish ship off the coast of cuba they escaped from their shackles and attacked the crew leaving two crew members alive to take them back to africa but the spanish sailors tricked the africans and sailed up the coast of the united states until an american naval ship off the coast of connecticut captured them brought into court to determine their fate the africans were claimed as property like livestock by both the spanish crew and by the american captors roger baldwin  matthew

the attempts of van buren to subvert the legal system established only decades before the essential commitment to freedom is so much a part of the story that at least in this one brief moment justice triumphed adams the fourth president made that his story continue reading talk to your kids about  families can talk about why it was important to prove where the africans were from what was calhouns
