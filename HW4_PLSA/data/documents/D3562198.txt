charming tale about a dissatisfied young man who would rather live in the golden days of a long past époque than in the present woody allen comes up with another adorable film and seems like having a lot of fun putting those delightful witty lines in the mouth of his idols carlos magalhães super reviewer½another light but quite mysterious and powerful drama from woody allen as simple as always the cast werent full of alist actor but theyre pretty convincing enough to me as they brought a good performance but overall its just another sweet romantic movie by woody allen not one of his best but definitely worth to watch sanjaya 丘耀文super reviewer½one of the most enjoyable and delightful of allens films to me wilson was great as woody allen as well graham jones super reviewer½ imghttpimagesrottentomatoescomimagesusericonsicon14gif imgdirectors cat super reviewer view all audience reviews midnight in paris quotes ernest i believe that love that is true and real creates a respite from death all cowardice comes from not loving or not loving well which is the same thing and then the man who is brave and true looks death squarely in the face like some rhinohunters i know or belmonte who is truly brave it is because they make love with sufficient passion to push death out of their minds until it returns as it does to all men and then you must make really good love again paul nostalgia is denial  denial of the painful present the name for this denial is golden age thinking  the erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one ones living in  its a flaw in the romantic imagination of those people who find it difficult to cope with the present gil adriana if you stay here though and this becomes your present then pretty soon youll start imagining another time was really your you know was really the golden time yeah thats what the present is its a little unsatisfying because lifes a little unsatisfying gert the artists job is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence view all news  features200 essential movies chosen by rt staffrenewed  canceled tvwhats on  whats gone56 rotten moviesthat we
