health other  health how long does it take weed to leave your body for a urine test how many days would it take for the urine to be clean i will be reporting unhelpful comments so just answer the question follow 10 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer there isnt a specific amount unfortunatly weed is a powerful drug that can kinda mess up your system causing for your body to carry it a significant amount of time for example lets say your 80 and your overweight would you think that it would leave the body as quick as a 14 year old skinny guy no its based on you and what you do nevertheless an average sized person with an average metabolism has weed in their system for about 20 days to a month then it begins to desintigrate fyi if u think that it destroys lungs weed cigaretts or anything else you smoke that destroys your lungs begins to heal within 24 hours of no longer smoking it like if u dont smoke over the weekend then about sunday your lungs begin to heal hope this helps i noe what ur going through cause its the same sht here source s my own expierencepizzahatyou · 8 years ago1 0 comment askers ratingminimum 57 days if you smoke say once a week or less if you smoke any more than that it will take at least 2 weeks if you smoke daily or multiple times a day 2 weeks is the minimum it can take up to 3 weeks thc is stored in your fat cells so the thinner you are the less your body will hold onto however this does not make the thc you are holding in your system leave any faster give it 2 weeks to be safe if you can drink lots of water to help the process along if you are in a jam they sell teas and other products at your local headshops but most of them will give you the runs so dont have any plans if you opt to try them they are not guaranteed and can be expensive but are an option if you are in a bind kelly · 8 years ago1 0 comment when you ask the question “how long does marijuana stay in your system” you need to take into account the fact that there is no simple answer to this question thc tetrahydrocannabinol can stay in a persons body for as long as 3 to 90 days after smoking or being ingested orally there are numerous determining factors for how long drug toxins stay in a persons body which vary from person to person such as the analytical method used your health your body weight metabolism fluid intake the type of drug toxin and the degree of exposure to the drug toxin the speed at which marijuana leaves your body depends both on the speed of your metabolism as well as on the half life of thc it’s estimated that thc can have a half life that ranges anywhere from 110 days it’s almost impossible to find out what that half life is which means that it is very difficult to use it to calculate how long it will take for all of the thc to leave your body askme · 8 years ago1 0 comment oh hey twin im the same age weight height smoked last friday and before that jan 2nd or something around that
