what are premature ventricular contractions pvcs readers comments 14 share your story premature ventricular contractions pvcs pvc are premature heartbeats originating from the ventricles of the heart premature ventricular contractions are premature because they occur before the regular heartbeat normal function of the heart the heart has four chambers the upper two chambers are the atria and the lower two chambers are the ventricles the atria deliver blood to the ventricles and the ventricles deliver blood to the lungs and to the rest of the body the right ventricle delivers blood to the lungs while the left ventricle delivers blood to the rest of the body the heartbeat pulse that we feel is caused by the contraction of the ventricles the heartbeat is normally controlled by the electrical system of the heart the electrical system of the heart consists of the sinoatrial sa node the atrioventricular av node and special tissues in the ventricles that conduct electricity the sa node is the hearts electrical pacemaker it is a small patch of cells located in the wall of the right atrium the frequency with which the sa node discharges electricity determines the rate at which the heart normally beats the sa node keeps the heart beating in a regular manner at rest the frequency of the electrical discharges originating from the sa node is low and the heart beats at the lower range of normal 60 to 80 beatsminute during exercise or excitement the frequency of discharges from the sa node increases increasing the rate at which the heart beats in people who exercise regularly the resting heart rate may be below 50 to 60 and is not of concern the electrical discharges pass from the sa node through the special tissues of the atria into the av node and through the av node to the special conduction tissues of the ventricles causing them to contract cpicture of the cross section of the heart what happens during a premature ventricular contraction during a premature ventricular contraction the ventricle electrically discharges and contracts prematurely before the normal electrical discharges arrive from the sa node these premature discharges are due to electrical irritability of the heart muscle of the ventricles and can be caused by heart attacks electrolyte imbalances lack of oxygen or medications immediately after a premature ventricular contraction the electrical system of the heart resets this resetting causes a brief pause in heartbeat and some patients report feeling the heart briefly stopping after a premature ventricular contraction how common are premature ventricular contractions premature ventricular contractions are common many people have premature ventricular contractions without any symptoms premature ventricular contractions may be more common among older patients patients with high blood pressure and patients with heart disease premature ventricular contractions can also occur in young healthy individuals without heart disease or high blood pressure from tips to better manage your migraine start now what causes premature ventricular contractions readers comments 42 share your story there are many causes of premature ventricular contractions which includeheart attackhigh blood pressurecardiomyopathy including congestive heart failuredisease of heart valves such as mitral valve prolapsehypokalemia low blood levels of potassium and hypomagnesaemia low blood levels of magnesium  hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia can occur for example in patients taking diuretics water pillshypoxia low amounts of oxygen in the blood for example hypoxia occurs with lung diseases such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copdmedications such as digoxin lanoxin aminophylline  phyllocontin truphylline  tricyclic antidepressants and ephedrine containing decongestantsexcessive intake of alcoholexcess caffeine intakestimulant drug use such as cocaine and amphetaminesmyocarditis heart muscle inflammation and

premature ventricular contractions often report no symptoms asymptomatic and are unaware of their premature ventricular contractions their premature ventricular contractions may be discovered when an electrocardiogram ecg ekg is performed for a routine physical insurance physical or preoperative evaluation patients with premature ventricular contractions sometimes report palpitations in the chest and in the neck palpitations are discomforting feelings due to forceful heartbeats the heartbeat immediately after a premature ventricular contraction is usually stronger the heart ventricle contracts more forcefully than normal patients with premature ventricular contractions may report feeling that the heart has stopped briefly this is because there is usually a brief pause in heartbeat after a premature ventricular contraction when the electrical system of the heart resets moreover the actual premature ventricular contraction beat may not be felt because the heart hasnt had time to fill with blood before beating so patients with pvcs often complain of skipped or missed beats patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions such as bigeminy every other heartbeat is a premature ventricular contraction couplets two consecutive premature ventricular contractions or triplets three consecutive premature ventricular contractions often report no symptoms but in rare occasions they may report weakness dizziness or fainting this is because frequent premature ventricular contractions can diminish the ability of the heart to pump blood to the other organs diminished cardiac output resulting in low blood pressure patients with three or more consecutive premature ventricular contractions in a row have ventricular tachycardia ventricular tachycardia that is prolonged can result in low cardiac output low blood pressure and fainting syncope ventricular tachycardia can also develop into ventricular fibrillation which is a fatal heart rhythm see below what are the dangers of premature ventricular contractions premature ventricular contractions in healthy individuals without high blood pressure and heart diseases do not pose any health risks premature ventricular contractions in patients with heart diseases heart attacks heart failure diseases of the heart valves may be associated with increased risks of developing ventricular tachycardia ventricular tachycardia is a sustained run of rapid ventricular contractions ventricular tachycardia is lifethreatening because 1 it occurs suddenly with no prior warning and 2 it frequently develops into ventricular fibrillation ventricular fibrillation is a chaotic rhythm where the ventricles quiver rapidly in a purposeless fashion the heart with ventricular fibrillation cannot pump blood effectively to the brain and the rest of the body if untreated ventricular fibrillation can be fatal within minutes an estimated 325000 americans die from sudden cardiac arrest including ventricular fibrillation each year many doctors believe that premature ventricular contractions do not necessarily cause ventricular tachycardias or ventricular fibrillations instead premature ventricular contractions may be merely indicators symptoms of serious heart diseases or other serious conditions such as hypokalemia hypoxia and ongoing heart damage from heart attacks or medications such as digoxin and aminophylline toxicity it must be emphasized that many premature ventricular contractions are harmless benign and not associated with structural heart disease if the workup for underlying heart disease is unrevealing the patient can be assured that their prognosis is excellent daily health news when is a headache an emergency bananas vs sports drinks genetic map of cancers older brains

contraction diagnosed ekg and holter there are two aspects in the diagnosis of premature ventricular contractions  detecting them and diagnosing the underlying causes electrocardiograms ekgs and holter monitors are used to diagnose premature ventricular contractions ekgs blood tests echocardiograms and cardiac stress tests are used to determine the underlying causes of premature ventricular contractions electrocardiogram ekgan electrocardiogram ekg or ecg is a brief recording of the hearts electrical discharges ekgs can be performed in the doctors offices clinics and hospital emergency rooms doctors frequently ask for a rhythm strip a prolonged ekg recording to be performed at the same time as an ekg to increase the chances of detecting premature ventricular contractions and other abnormal rhythms the premature ventricular contractions are easy to recognize on ekg and rhythms strips provided premature ventricular contractions occur during the recording ekg may also demonstrate other problems such as heart attacks hypokalemia digoxin toxicity and heart muscle thickening hypertrophy due to long term high blood pressure holter monitor a standard ekg and a rhythm strip performed at the time of a visit to the doctors office may not detect the premature ventricular contractions because they may not be occurring at that moment holter monitoring is then necessary to detect the premature ventricular contractions in these patients with heart palpitations a holter monitor is a continuous recording of the hearts rhythm for 24 hours holter monitoring can be used diagnose premature ventricular contractions as well as other heart rhythm abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardias pvcs are present in more than 6 of middleaged adults pvcs can be demonstrated during holter monitoring however not all premature ventricular contractions found during holter monitoring are clinically important doctors interpreting the holter monitoring studies must take into account the patients medical history in determining the importance of holter monitor findings in patients with infrequent symptoms an event marker may be used in lieu of a holter monitor as this can be worn for up to 30 days how is premature ventricular contraction diagnosed echo and stress test echocardiography echocardiography uses ultrasound waves to produce images of the hearts chambers and valves and the lining around the heart pericardium echocardiography is useful in measuring the size of the heart chambers the forcefulness of heart ventricle contractions the thickness of the heart muscles and the functioning of the heart valves echocardiography is therefore useful in diagnosing conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions such as mitral valve prolapse echocardiography can detect and measure the severity of mitral valve prolapse and other valvular diseases muscle hypertrophy echocardiography can detect heart muscle hypertrophy thickening of heart muscle as a result of longterm high blood pressure heart muscle damage echocardiography can measure the extent of heart muscle damage from heart attacks or cardiomyopathy ejection fraction echocardiography can be used to calculate the ejection fraction of the left ventricle ejection fraction is a measure estimate of the amount of blood pumped during each contraction of the ventricle heart ventricles extensively weakened by heart attacks or cardiomyopathy will have low ejection fractions patients with low ejection fractions have higher risks of developing lifethreatening ventricular tachycardias and fibrillations than patients with normal ejection fractions exercise cardiac stress test treadmill stress testexercise cardiac stress testing ecst is the most widely used cardiac stress test the patient exercises on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol with progressive increases in the speed and elevation of the treadmill typically changing at 3minute intervals during the ecst the patients electrocardiogram ekg heart rate heart rhythm and blood pressure are continuously monitored if a coronary arterial blockage results in decreased blood flow to a part of the heart during exercise certain changes may be observed in the ekg including increases in premature ventricular contractions and development of ventricular tachycardias subscribe to medicine nets heart health newsletter by clicking submit i agree to the medicine nets terms  conditions  privacy policy and understand that i may opt out of medicine nets subscriptions at any time how is premature ventricular contraction diagnosed ecst and blood tests adjuncts to ecst stress echo and nuclear imaginganother supplement to the routine ecst is stress echocardiography during stress echocardiography the sound waves of ultrasound are used to produce images of the heart at rest and at the peak of exercise in a heart with normal blood supply all segments of the left ventricle the major pumping chamber of the heart exhibit enhanced contractions of the heart muscle during peak exercise conversely in the setting of cardiovascular disease if a segment of the left ventricle does not receive optimal blood flow during exercise that segment will demonstrate reduced contractions of heart muscle relative to the rest of the heart on the exercise echocardiogram stress echocardiography is very useful in enhancing the interpretation of the ecst and can be used to exclude the presence of significant cardiovascular disease in patients suspected of having a falsepositive ecst alternatively nuclear imaging may be used as an adjunct to ecst and may be even more sensitive in noninvasively detecting underlying coronary artery disease blood tests in diagnosing causes of premature ventricular contractions blood tests for diagnosing conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions includeblood electrolyte levels can be performed to detect low potassium or magnesium levels hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemiablood drug levels can be performed to detect digoxin and aminophylline drug toxicity or thyroid levels for example an overactive thyroid may result in premature ventricular contractionsblood oxygenation  oximetry can be measured to detect hypoxiablood tests can be performed to detect illicit drugs such as amphetamine abuse andblood levels of cardiac enzymes creatine phosphokinase cpk troponins regulatory proteins can be performed to assess for heart muscle damage as a result of heart attacks from healthy heart resources

solutions from our sponsors frequent constipation greater food accessibility what are the reasons for treating premature ventricular contractions readers comments 11 share your story the reasons for treating premature ventricular contractions areto relieve symptoms of palpitationsto treat conditions that cause premature ventricular contractions since many conditions that cause premature ventricular contractions are potentially life threatening andto prevent ventricular tachycardia and sudden death in healthy individuals without heart disease premature ventricular contractions need no treatment for relief of palpitations one may consider the following measuresstop alcohol and caffeine intakestop the use of overthecounter otc nasal decongestants that may contain adrenaline such as medications containing pseudoephedrine certain weight loss supplements may aggravate premature ventricular contractions and should never be used without consulting with ones physicianstop drug abuse such as amphetamines cocaine andstop cigarette smoking conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions can also be potentiality lifethreatening these conditions are often treated in hospitalmonitored beds monitored beds are beds or rooms that are equipped to record the patients heart rhythm continuously patients are also given intravenous medications these conditions arelow potassium or magnesium levels hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia  potassium and magnesium can be given intravenouslydigoxin and aminophylline toxicity  medications can be given to counteract drug toxicityacute heart attack  medications and procedures  coronary angiogram and ptca are performed urgently to open blocked coronary arteries to restore blood supply to the heart muscle andlow blood oxygen levels hypoxia  oxygen can be given nasally and medications can be given to treat the underlying lung diseases what medications treat premature ventricular contractions antiarrhythmia medications antiarrhythmia medications are used to control premature ventricular contractions with the goal of preventing ventricular tachycardias ventricular fibrillations and sudden death examples of antiarrhythmia medications include betablockers amiodarone cordarone and several others unfortunately there is little scientific evidence that suppressing premature ventricular contractions with antiarrhythmic medications prevents ventricular tachycardias ventricular fibrillations and sudden death some antiarrhythmia medications actually can cause abnormal heart rhythms thus antiarrhythmic medications are only prescribed cautiously in patients at high risk of developing ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation and usually initially in the hospital setting this does not apply to betablockers which are prescribed to many heart patients for many reasons and not only do not accelerate arrhythmias but usually decrease premature ventricular contractions in many patients with premature ventricular contractions and significant underlying cardiac disease or with severe symptoms electrophysiology testing ep may be recommended this is a test performed with catheters to see if a patient is at risk of lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmias which are treated with either medications or sometimes tiny implantable defibrillators premature ventricular contractions pvcs pvc

concentration of oxygen in the blood oximetry is used in the evaluation of various medical conditions that affect the function of the heart and lungs pulse oximeters are the most common oximeter used because they respond only to pulsations oximetry can also be done on blood within the heart or on whole blood that has been removed from the body similar technology to oximetry is currently used to measure carbon dioxide levels at the skin palpitations overview palpitations are uncomfortable sensations of the heart beating hard rapidly or irregularly some types of palpitations are benign while others are more serious palpitations are diagnosed by taking the patient history and by performing an ekg or heart monitoring along with blood tests an electrophysiology study may also be performed
