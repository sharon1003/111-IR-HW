the shapes of simple molecules containing double bonds carbon dioxide co 2carbon dioxide could be drawn without making any assumptions about the shape as the carbon originally had 4 electrons in its outer level group 4 each oxygen contributes 2 electrons  1 for each bond that means there are a total of 8 electrons around the carbon in 4 pairs because there are 4 bonds these are all bond pairs each double bond uses 2 bond pairs  which are then thought of as a single unit those two double bond units will try to get as far apart as possible and so the molecule is linear the structure weve drawn above does in fact represent the shape of the molecule sulphur dioxide so 2sulphur dioxide could be drawn exactly the same as carbon dioxide again without making any assumptions about the shape the argument develops differently though sulphur has 6 electrons in its outer level and the oxygens between them contribute another 4 1 for each bond that gives 10 electrons in total  5 pairs 4 pairs are needed for the bonds leaving 1 lone pair each double bond uses 2 bond pairs and can be thought of as a single unit there are 2 double bond units and 1 lone pair which will try to get as far apart as possible  taking up a trigonal planar arrangement because the lone pair isnt counted when you describe the shape so 2 is described as bent or vshaped in this case our original structure misrepresented the shape the shapes of ions containing double bonds this is much more tricky before you can do anything else you need to know exactly how the ion is bonded  which bonds are double which bonds are single and where the charges are check your syllabus to find out whether you really need to bother about all this fortunately there is a simplifying factor in the three ions you might need to know about not one of them has a lone pair on the central atom that means that the shapes are all pretty obvious as long as you know the bonding the sulphate ion so 42the sulphate ion is bonded like this the negative charges are found on two of the oxygen atoms
