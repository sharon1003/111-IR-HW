that a conviction for any felony crime triggers a lifetime federal firearms prohibition misdemeanor assault in maine definitions sentences all of maine’s assault laws start with 17a §207 this lays out the basic elements of the crime and provides that a person is guilty of assault in maine if they intentionally knowingly or recklessly cause bodily injury oroffensive physical contact to another person state of mind of course the statute doesn’t mean much unless we understand the terms it uses first assault has a state of mind element that means that a person only commits assault when a certain thought process leads to the bodily injury or physical contact a person who accidentally crashes their car might cause an injury but they have committed no assault here’s how maine law defines these states of mind intentionally a person acts intentionally when it is their conscious object to cause such a result knowingly a person acts knowingly when the person is aware that it is practically certain that their conduct will cause such a result recklessly a person acts recklessly when the person consciously disregards a risk that their conduct will cause such a result bodily injury bodily injury is defined by 17a §2 5 to mean “physical pain physical illness or any impairment of physical condition” that’s a pretty broad definition if it hurts it’s bodily injury offensive physical contact offensive physical contact is a bit harder to nail down and there’s no statute that details the definition you might presume that “offensive physical contact” is only proven where the victim testifies that they found the contact to be somehow offensive unfortunately you would be wrong to prove offensive physical contact the prosecution only needs to show that a reasonable person would have been offended by the contact offensive physical contact that doesn’t offend the maine supreme court first considered what “offensive physical contact” means in the 1981 case state v bushey defendants in that case were very drunk and were arrested after grabbing and hitting a police officer they caused no injury but were charged with assault at trial the officer actually testified that the contact was not offensive the jury convicted anyway in affirming the conviction the maine supreme court decided that offensive physical contact must be judged from an objective standard while the victim’s subjective reaction to the contact is important it does determine the issue otherwise the court reasoned a very sensitive victim would be assaulted at the slightest touch while an insensitive person could be beaten with impunity since that case juries have generally been instructed as follows offensive physical contact is defined as knowingly intending bodily contact or unlawful touching done in such a manner as would reasonably be expected to violate the person or dignity of the victim it’s something less than bodily injury… but requires more than a mere touching of another and basically its a question of was the contact under the circumstances such that a reasonable person would find it to be offensive you may consider what a reasonable person might consider under the circumstances to be offensive as well as the subjective interpretation of the contact as a particular victim might testify to during the course of the trial state v pozzuoli 1997 assault is a class d crime punishable by up to 364 days in jail and 2000 in fines since the maximum sentence is less than one year the crime is a referred to a as a misdemeanor you can read this article for more details

for priors maine law allows an assault that would otherwise be charged as a class d misdemeanor to be charged as a class c felony if the defendant has two prior conviction for certain offenses the statue detailing this is 17a §1252 4a the following prior convictions can be used assaultcriminal threateningterrorizingreckless conduct or another offense listed in chapter 9any sexual assault listed in chapter 11kidnaping criminal restraint or any other offense listed in chapter 13aggravated criminal trespass by entering a dwelling illegally and then violating chapter 9 or 11 17a §402a 1 arobbery 17a §651 assault on an officer 17a §752aassault on an emergency medical care provider 17a §752cunder 17a §9a prior convictions can be counted if they predate the current offense by 10 years or less except that for sexual assault offenses the priors can be from any time priors from other states of from federal court also count if they are for “substantially similar conduct” to any of the evenses listed above if the charge is a class a felony such as elevated aggravated assault there is no way to increase the sentencing class since it’s already the highest class under maine law for class a crimes the statute does provide that “the prior record must be given serious consideration by the court when imposing a sentence”aggravated assault injury weapon indifference aggravated assault is a class b felony crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison there are 3 subsections to 17a §208 and those define the aggravating factors that will make an otherwise misdemeanor assault into an aggravated assault1 serious bodily injury if a person commits an assault as defined above and causes serious bodily injury they can be charged with aggravated assault serious bodily injury is defined by 17a §2 23 as follows“serious bodily injury” means a bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious permanent disfigurement or loss or substantial impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ or extended convalescence necessary for recovery of physical health2 use of a dangerous weapon if a dangerous weapon is used to cause bodily injury which includes pain the defendant can be charged with aggravated assault the weapon does not need to be a gun or knife or even an object normally thought of as a weapon almost any object like a stick bottle or car can count the term is defined in 17a §2 9 a“use of a dangerous weapon” means the use of a firearm or other weapon device instrument material or substance whether animate or inanimate which in the manner it is used or threatened to be used is capable of producing death or serious bodily injury3 extreme indifference choking a newer section of maine’s aggravated assault law allows the charge where the defendant causes “bodily injury to another under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life” the statute goes on to explain that such circumstances include but are not limited to the number location or nature of the injuries the manner or method inflicted the observable physical condition of the victim or the use of strangulation for the purpose of this paragraph “strangulation” means the intentional impeding of the breathing or circulation of the blood of another person by applying pressure on the person’s throat or neck this alternative comes up a lot in domestic violence assault cases maine prosecutors will not hesitate to charge aggravated assault where a man is alleged to have put his hands around a woman’s neck elevated aggravated assault elevated aggravated assault is a class a felony crime with a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison it’s defined by 17a §208 and that section provides that a person is guilty of elevated aggravated assault if that person intentionally or knowingly causes serious bodily injury to another person with the use of a dangerous weapon or engages in conduct that manifests a depraved indifference to the value of human life and that in fact causes serious bodily injury to another person with the use of a dangerous weapon or with terroristic intent engages in conduct that in fact causes serious bodily injury to another person“terroristic intent” is defined by 17a §2 25 it means the intent to do any of the following for the purpose of intimidating or coercing a civilian population or to affect the conduct of government cause serious bodily injury or death to multiple personscause substantial damage to multiple structures or cause substantial damage to critical infrastructure obviously elevated aggravated assault is only proven if the victim actually suffers serious bodily injury also elevated aggravated assault drops the recklessness state of mind option the more serious charge must be supported by the more culpable intentional knowing or depraved indifference state of mind this makes these charges harder for the prosecution to prove since mere recklessness will not support a conviction felony domestic violence assault everything above also applies to domestic violence assault charges having two of the priors listed above use of a weapon serious injury or strangulation will all end in felony charges but when it comes to domestic violence you only need one of the following prior convictions to trigger a class c felony assault charge domestic violence assault 17a §207adomestic violence criminal threatening 17a §209a domestic violence terrorizing 17a §210b domestic violence stalking 17a §210c domestic violence reckless conduct 17a §211a violating a protection from abuse order 19a § 4011felony violation of conditions of release 15 §1092 1 b where the defendant was on bail for a domestic violence felony and violated a bail condition prohibiting contact with the victim or possessing a firearm the prior convictions must be within 10 years of the current offense priors from other jurisdictions for “substantially similar conduct” can also be counted you can
