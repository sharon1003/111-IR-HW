dealers association wyoming has no cap according to the wyoming automobile dealers association well try to answer any remaining questions whats a doc fee anyway doc fees cover the cost a dealership incurs to process a vehicle purchase in other words dealers pay for all the paperwork such as registration and personnel involved with selling you that shiny new ride the fees originated when dealerships separated their finance and insurance departments commonly dubbed fi from the rest of the dealership around the 1960s seung min mel yu told us yu is an independent automotive consultant whos owned chrysler and volkswagen dealerships in wisconsin and michigan the dealerships departments — sales service and so on — made money off various parts of the transaction the fi department meanwhile took on the processing side — but had little revenue to pay for itself thats basically where the documentation fee was created yu said is it charged for used vehicles too generally but thats up to the individual car lot if theres a cap can businesses elect to charge less yes but thats up to the individual state and car seller it depends on what that state law says sherralyn peterson an incentives consultant who works with gm and ford across 21 states told us some state laws say you have to charge everybody the same amount so if it says that then you really cant deviate what if i lease a new car do i have to pay doc fees on that too yes peterson said i live in a state with sales tax is a doc fee taxable it depends california illinois and arkansas specify their caps as taxable iowa says documentation fees are not taxable each state has its own laws do all shoppers at a given dealership have to pay the same amount usually most dealers now are real cautious about being consistent with all their customers peterson said i see most dealers charging the same amount still some states have unique fees for certain buyers michigan and ohio stipulate lower costs for anyone who buys an especially cheap car some automakers stipulate unique fees for certain buyers when i had a chrysler store in wisconsin i was charging 135 yu said but for customers with a familyandfriends or employee discount he was allowed to only charge 75 are doc fees negotiable dealership fees cover real costs so it depends on where you buy your car if you have someone thats irate about it you have to figure out a way to somehow adjust it peterson said and there are ways even if a seller wont budge on the fee remember that the outthedoor price typically is negotiable so a reduction somewhere else could account for a steep doc fee what if i live in a different state from the dealership you pay the doc fees based on where the dealership is not where you live peterson said that differs from sales tax which you pay based on your residence why dont more states cap doc fees in a perfect world all businesses would charge similar document fees — and no one would be out of line unfortunately some businesses charge excessive amounts a 2012 investigation by phoenixs knxv television station found local dealerships charging as much as 499 peterson said shes seen fees range from 100 to 500 thats why associations encourage moderation the iowa automobile dealers association cautions every dealer that charges an unreasonably high doc fee is putting the dealership — and all iowa dealers — at risk for an investigation bill sepic president of the wisconsin automobile  truck dealers association told us the dealer has to have documentation of what makes the doc fee reasonable and the texas automobile dealers association told us that although texas has no cap the state imposes a 125 safe harbor provision — essentially if businesses charge 125 or less theyre unlikely to be investigated
