grandiflora which is native to the american south as well as mexican species like magnolia dealbata have been found to be sources of honokiol 1 traditionally in asian medicine the magnolia biondii magnolia obovata and magnolia officinalis are commonly used 2 the compound itself has a spicy odor because of its physical properties honokiol can readily cross the blood brain barrier and the bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier 1 3 as a result honokiol is a potentially potent therapy with high bioavailability chemistry  editstructure  edithonokiol belongs to a class of neolignan biphenols as a polyphenol it is relatively small and can interact with cell membrane proteins through intermolecular interactions like hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions or aromatic pi orbital covalency 1 it is hydrophobic and readily dissolved in lipids it is structurally similar to propofol 1purification  editthere are several methods for purifying and isolating honokiol in nature honokiol exists with its structural isomer magnolol which differs from honokiol only by the position of one hydroxyl group because of the very similar properties of magnolol and honokiol purification has often been limited to a hplc or electromigration however methods developed in 2006 by workers in the lab of jack l arbiser took advantage of the proximity of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in magnolol which form a protectable diol to generate a magnolol acetonide  figure 1  with a subsequent simple purification via flash chromatography over silica 4figure 1magnolol and honokiol are normally inseparable honokiol is easily separable from the protected magnolol acetonide additionally a rapid separation approach was published in the journal of chromatography a in 2007 the process uses highcapacity highspeed countercurrent chromatography highcapacity hsccc 5 through this method honokiol can be separated and purified to above 98 purity with a high yield in under an hour history  edittraditional medicine  editseed cone extracts from the bark or seed cones of the magnolia tree have been widely used in traditional medicine in china korea and japan 2magnolia bark has traditionally been used in eastern medicine as analgesic and to treat anxiety and mood disorders 2 6 in traditional chinese medicine magnolia bark is called houpu and is most commonly taken from two species magnolia obovata and magnolia officinalis 7 some chinese traditional formulas containing houpu include banxia houpu tang 半夏厚朴丸 xiao zhengai tang ping wei san 平胃散 and shenmi tang 2 japanese kampo formulas include hangekobokuto 半夏厚朴湯 and saibokuto 柴朴湯 2 6seeds medical research  editthis section needs more medical references for verification or relies too heavily on primary sources please review the contents of the section and add the appropriate references if you can unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed june 2014honokiol is a pleiotropic compound meaning it is able to act on the body through a number of pathways this diversity of interaction makes it a viable therapy for a number of conditions in the central nervous system cardiovascular system and gastrointestinal system it has been shown to have antitumorigenic antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects as well 1 8 9side effects and contraindications  editresearch has shown a fairly limited side effect profile for honokiol and it appears to be fairly well tolerated however its antithrombotic effects could cause hemorrhage especially in patients with conditions that would put them at a higher risk like hemophilia or von willebrand disease 1 additionally patients already taking anticoagulants should talk to their doctor before taking honokiol supplements honokiol is also neurotoxic at high concentrations in a 2002 study researchers induced cell death in fetal rat cortical neurons by directly applying 100μm in vitro 10pharmacology  editantitumorigenic activities  edithonokiol has shown pro apoptotic effects in melanoma sarcoma myeloma leukemia bladder lung prostate oral squamous cell carcinoma 11 in glioblastome multiforme cells 12 and colon cancer cell lines 13 14 15 16 honokiol inhibits phosphorylation of akt p4442 mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk and src additionally honokiol regulates the nuclear factor kappa b nfκb activation pathway an upstream effector of vascular endothelial growth factor vegf mcl1 and cyclooxygenase 2 cox2 all significant pro angiogenic and survival factors honokiol induces caspasedependent apoptosis in a trailmediated manner and potentiates the proapoptotic effects of doxorubicin and other etoposides so potent is honokiols proapoptotic effects that it overcomes even notoriously drug resistant neoplasms such as multiple myeloma and chronic bcell leukemia honokiol also acts on the pi3k  m tor pathway in tumor cells while maintaining pathway activity in t cells 17neurotrophic activity  edithonokiol has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth and have neuroprotective effects in rat cortical neurons additionally honokiol increases free cytoplasmic ca 2 in rat cortical neurons 10 honokiol is a weak cannabinoid cb2 receptor ligand but the naturally occurring derivative 4omethylhonokiol was shown to be a potent and selective cannabinoid cb2 receptor inverse agonist and to possess antiosteoclastic effects 18antithrombotic activity  edithonokiol inhibits platelet aggregation in rabbits in a dosedependent manner and protects cultured raec against oxidized low density lipoprotein injury honokiol significantly increases the prostacyclin metabolite 6ketopgf1alpha potentially the key factor in honokiols antithrombotic activity 19antiinflammatory activity  editstudies examining honokiol as a protective therapy against focal cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury have identified a number of antiinflammatory pathways neutrophil infiltration of injured tissues can cause further damage and issues with healing in in vitro studies honokiol reduced f mlp nformylmethionylleucylphenylalanine and pma  phorbol12myristate13acetate induced neutrophil firm adhesion which is an integral step for infiltration 1 20 honokiol inhibits ros production in neutrophils 20 honokiol also blocks inflammatory factor production in glial cells through the inhibition on nfκb activation 21 22 this mechanism is believed to suppress production of no tumor necrosis factorα  tnfα  and rantes  ccl5 21antioxidant activity  edithonokiol has also been proposed as an antioxidant the compound protects against lipid peroxidation by interfering with ros production and migration 20 accumulation of ros extracellularly causes macromolecular damage while intracellular accumulation may induce cytokine activation cytotoxicity inhibition  editone way that honokiol acts as a neuroprotective is through cellular regulation and subsequent inhibition of cytotoxicity two mechanisms used to achieve this inhibition are gaba a modulation and ca 2 inhibition cytotoxicity inhibition may be the neuroprotective mechanism of honokiol honokiol has also been shown to inhibit repetitive firing by blocking glutamate 23gaba amodulation  editgaba a receptor binding sites it is believed that honokiol acts on gaba areceptors similarly to benzodiazepines and zdrugs however honokiol has been shown to achieve anxiolysis with fewer motor or cognitive side effects than gaba a receptor agonists such as flurazepam and diazepam it has been shown that honokiol likely has a higher selectivity for different gaba a receptor subtypes and both magnolol and honokiol showed higher efficacy when acting on receptors containing δ subunits 1 gaba a receptors control ligandgated cl − channels that can help increase seizure thresholds through the influx of chloride anions honokiol may also affect the synthesis of gaba in a study where mice received seven daily injections of honokiol researchers observed a significant increase in hippocampal levels of glutamate decarboxylase gad 67 a precursor to gaba 24ca 2inhibition  edita high concentration of ca 2 induces excitotoxicity which is believed to be the main mechanism behind movement disorders such as als parkinsons disease and convulsive disorders like epilepsy honokiol disrupts the interfaces post synaptic density protein  psd95 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase  n nos  1 psd95 and n nos coupling to the nmda receptor causes a conformational change responsible for the intracellular influx of ca 2 which could in turn be a pathway for neurotoxicity calcium overloading can also cause damage by overactivation of calciumstimulated enzymes honokiol can reduce calcium influx through inhibition of the f mlp al f 4 − and thapsigargin gprotein pathways 20antiviral activity  edithonokiol has been shown to inhibit hepatitis c virus hcv infection in vitro 25 it has weak in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus hiv1 4metabolic activity  edithonokiol was shown to normalize blood glucose levels and prevent body weight gain in diabetic mice by acting as agonist of ppargamma 26pharmacokinetics  editthe pharmacokinetics of honokiol have been explored in rats and mice however further research must be done in humans 27 intravenous delivery of 5–10 mgkg in rodent models has shown a plasma halflife of around 40–60 minutes while intraperitoneal injections of 250 mgkg had a plasma halflife around 4–6 hours with maximum plasma concentration occurring between 20–30 minutes 1 28delivery methods  edithonokiol is most commonly taken orally there are a number of supplements available containing honokiol magnolia tea made from the bark of the tree is also a common delivery method of honokiol  citation needed both native americans and japanese medicine use tea gargles to treat toothaches and sore throats 29 because honokiol is highly hydrophobic it must be dissolved in a lipid for many delivery methods in many current animal studies the compound is dissolved in a lipid emollient and delivered through intraperitoneal injection there is ongoing  when work developing liposomal emulsions for iv delivery 27references  edit a b c d e f g h i j woodbury anna yu shan ping wei ling garcía paul 2013 neuromodulating effects of honokiol a review frontiers in neurology 265 7 4111–5
