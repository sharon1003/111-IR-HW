dsm5 changes addiction substancerelated disorders  alcoholism by john m grohol psy d  1 min read the new diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 5th edition dsm5 has a number of changes to addictions substancerelated disorders and alcoholism this article outlines some of the major changes to these conditions according to the american psychiatric association apa the publisher of the dsm5 the major change with substance abuse and alcohol abuse and dependence disorders has been the removal of the distinction between “abuse” and “dependence” the chapter also moves “gambling disorder” into it as a behavioral addiction according to the apa this change “reflects the increasing and consistent evidence that some behaviors such as gambling activate the brain reward system with effects similar to those of drugs of abuse and that gambling disorder symptoms resemble substance use disorders to a certain extent”criteria and terminology i always thought it was completely arbitrary that the dsmiv made a distinction between someone struggling with substance “abuse” and “dependence” to me — and to many other clinicians — they instead appeared to be the same disorder but on a continuum of abuse finally the dsm5 comes around to the convention wisdom of therapists in the field“criteria are provided for substance use disorder accompanied by criteria for intoxication withdrawal substancemedicationinduced disorders and unspecified substanceinduced disorders where relevant” according to the apa there are two major changes to the new dsm5 criteria for substance use disorder“recurrent legal problems” criterion for substance abuse has been deleted from dsm5a new criterion has been added craving or a strong desire or urge to use a substance the threshold for substance use disorder diagnosis in dsm5 is set at two or more criteria this is a change from dsmiv where abuse required a threshold of one or more criteria be met and three or more for dsmiv substance dependence cannabis withdrawal is new for dsm5 according to the apa as is caffeine withdrawal which was in dsmiv appendix b “criteria sets and axes provided for further study”“of note the criteria for dsm5 tobacco use disorder are the same as those for other substance use disorders by contrast dsmiv did not have a category for tobacco abuse so the criteria in dsm5 that are from dsmiv abuse are new for tobacco in dsm5”severity of the dsm5 substance use disorders is based on the number of criteria endorsed2–3 criteria indicate a mild disorder4–5 criteria a moderate disorder6 or more a severe disorder the dsm5 removes the physiological subtype not sure when this was ever used in the dsmiv as well as the diagnosis for “polysubstance dependence”last the apa notes that “early remission from a dsm5 substance use disorder is defined as at least 3 but less than 12 months without substance use disorder criteria except craving and sustained remission is defined as at least 12 months without criteria except craving additional new dsm5 specifiers include “in a controlled environment” and “on maintenance therapy” as the situation warrants”related dsm5 changes personality disorders axis iimay 29 2013in borderline personality disorderdsm5 changes bipolar  related disorders may 19 2013in bipolar disorderdsm5 changes sleepwake disorders may 30 2013in dsmlast reviewed by john m grohol psy d on 21 may 2013 originally published on psych centralcom on 21 may 2013 all rights reserved related content from our sponsors apa reference grohol j 2013 dsm5 changes addiction substancerelated disorders  alcoholism psych central  retrieved on april 11 2018 from httpspropsychcentralcomdsm5changesaddictionsubstancerelateddisordersalcoholism« dsm5 changes neurodevelopmental disorders suicide risk  antidepressants 2004 update »
