– or they want to read more do children pay tax on savings theres a common myth that children dont pay tax – thats simply not true in fact theyre taxed in exactly the same way as adults yet most children dont have jobs or earned income and for the 201819 tax year if theyve no income they can earn up to £17850 from savings without paying tax on it thats the £11850 personal allowance  £5000 starting savings allowance  the £1000 personal savings allowance psa  even if they do have income and even if it means theyre a taxpayer on it the personal savings allowance which launched on 6 april 2016 means if theyre basic rate taxpayers they can earn £1000 of savings interest taxfree plus the other psa benefit is all savings interest is now paid taxfree so the old system where special forms needed to be signed for children to receive interest gross taxfree has gone yet there is one fly in the ointment if money is given by a parent or stepparent and the interest is over £100year the whole thing is taxed like its the parents cash money given to a child by each parent or stepparent not grandparents aunts uncles etc which generates more than £100year in interest in normal nonjunior isa savings will be paid at the parents tax rate the £100 allowance is on a per parent basis rather than a per child basis the aims to stop parents using their kids taxfree allowance for an extra allowance once the child earns more than this the whole lot is taxed at the parents tax rate yet even then if the parent is within their personal savings allowance and the childs savings dont take them over then itd still be taxfree yet if the child goes over the £100 limit and the parent is over the psa then their savings would be taxable in which case saving it in a junior isa would be a tax

their adult life so doling out a piggy bank or calculator is a cheap way to bag 20 30 or even 40 years of custom therefore unless youre only putting in a small amount of money – so the freebie value outweighs anything else – youll do far better to focus on interest but once youve set up the bestpaying childrens account you can do your kids a great service by teaching them a bit of banking

july 2017use your childs taxfree allowanceusing your children taxefficiently sounds slightly callous but if you are better off so are your kids saving money in a childs name means you often save at a higher rate of interest its perfectly possible to have one account for your child to put their pocket money into and another for any larger amounts the personal savings allowance psa – where basicrate taxpayers can earn £1000 interest each year without paying tax £500 for higherrate payers nothing for additionalraters – has made this less of an issue but its still worth considering if youre close to maxing out your psa know the tax implications if its their own money children can earn the same £17000 a year in interest as adults before it gets taxed however dont assume you can dunk fortunes in your kids name if a child generates more than £100 interest in the course of the year from money specifically given by each parent or stepparent so £200 for a couple with a child this income falls under that parents psa – and if theyve used theirs up then itll be taxed at their rate in practical terms this means you could put up to £6600 in the 3 top paying childrens account £3300 per parent and it wouldnt be taxed as that would generate around £99 each just to clarify this doesnt mean £6600 every year its the interest generated from all cash given in this and previous years one way around this is with junior isas where £4260 can be saved in the childs name and is free of tax regardless – read our full junior isa guide also these rules only apply to parents not grandparents aunties uncles or friends they may all give your children as much as they like and providing its a genuine gift it counts as the childs money without a £100 limit the only other tax implications of making cash gifts is the possible spectre of inheritance tax if the donor dies within seven years of making it a warning for bright sparks thinking if i gave my brothers kids £17000 and he gave mine the same good thought but no cigar if hm revenue  customs spots you youre in trouble whose money is it anyway its worth remembering if the moneys in your childs name its your childs cash yet if youre worried that by putting £1000 in their name theyll splash out on 52 ringtones an xbox and enough sweets to give a junior school a sugar rush dont be many accounts will allow the adult to stay in control of the cash until the child turns 16 when they do the cash is technically theirs to do with what they wish most banks require a child to be at least seven before they can open an account for themselves though they do all differ so its always worth checking the specifics undersevens require a parent guardian or grandparent to set up an account and act as signatory this method can also be selected for older children if it is then usually until theyre 16 the signatory can still manage and withdraw the cash without the childs approval many accounts have terms and conditions stating withdrawn money must be used for the benefit of the child but of course this encompasses a wide variety of definitions the size of the saving for calculating the interest on childrens savings make
