the star of amc’s revolutionary war drama turn washington’s spies is jamie bell who plays a long island farmer turned reluctant patriot named abraham woodhull who becomes one of the major players in a new york spy ring that helped the americans turn the tide of the war in season 2 he shared the stage with the austere general george washington ian kahn and the splashy introduction of soontobenotorious american hero benedict arnold owain yeoman it’s ironic perhaps then that the show’s most compelling character is the americans’ most formidable adversary british major john andre in season 2 which arrives on dvd on march 22 andre jj feild has settled into occupied philadelphia — living in ben franklin’s abandoned mansion no less — awaiting the inevitable crushing of the colonial rebellion he combines work and pleasure to pursue peggy shippen ksenia solo a wealthy and beautiful socialite who once flirted with america’s boldest and most respected field general benedict arnold even while he’s falling for peggy he’s setting the trap to tempt arnold to betray the revolutionary cause and hand the brits victory andre is a charming fellow a tribute to the man himself and the actor who brings him to life the 37yearold feild is an americanborn brit and there are episodes in season 2 where you can’t help but root for him damn the history books not only is he more clever than any of his peers always three steps ahead of superiors and the amateur american spymasters but he is noble and wellintentioned — the best and the brightest of his generation history may not be on his side but as his romantic triangle with shippen and arnold tilts away from him he suddenly has become the character many viewers care most about in this exclusive featurette from the season 2 dvd the personal and professional landscapes are established that explain how the desires of three people will decide the fates of two nations when season 3 of turn returns on april 25 andre is feeling intense pressure to crack the culper ring to win back peggy and to turn a crucial rebel so as to end the war he’s the rare breed who would try to accomplish all three in one fell swoop entertainment weekly your john andre has become one of the great secret weapons of the show i suspect that the juicy pitch that sold amc was the story behind benedict arnold’s treachery but for viewers and studentsof history i feel like the looming tragedy of john andre is becoming the heart of the story how was the character initially pitched to you jj feild i was actually in sundance with austenland of all things and amc approached me there they sent me the script and in the pilot andre didn’t have much so i was sort of confused about what i would do then i simply started the world of research and discovered this incredible man who seemed to be the right man on the wrong side of history and that’s sort of how showrunner craig silverstein pitched it to me we talked about the man who turned benedict arnold and the man who ultimately paid the price for someone else’s treachery that’s very well put the right man on the wrong side of history because andre’s background was not wealthy or noble or elite he had a very modest background yeah he was a selfmade man his father was a merchant i suppose you would say middle class he had this incredible story where he was sort of shunned at the altar by a woman who was of higher status than he was she backed out of an engagement and very soon after he signed up for the army he proved himself in the canadian campaign before moving down to america in fact he was a prisoner of war for 18 months — this is before the show starts as it were in those days if you were an officer that meant basically that you were a house guest of someone so he spent 18 months staying at different american officers’ houses and entertaining them and their wives down the east coast of america so he was already very well known to the americas before the benedict arnold story and what i was always interested in that he had a great love of america i think he fell in love with the place and really thought that he was going to try and make this work but sadly all went wrong he’s quite the seducer yes he has a way with the ladies after he died there were all the houses that he stayed in when he was a prisoner of war that seemed to have a locket of his hair and a drawing of the husband’s wife that’s not just a polite house guest i think he ingratiated himself with just about everyone he could find quite a wellknown womanizer i read somewhere whether it’s true or not that ian fleming originally based james bond on john andre as the first gentleman spy and not necessarily just women right there’s some presumed intimacy in season 2 with his senior officer with hints of sexual attraction there’s a lot of propaganda that andre and clinton were lovers — a lot of american propaganda it was always seen as complete propaganda but what we had fun with was going “well what could be the truth behind the rumors” there’s a ballroom scene where clinton sort of eyes up some of the younger prettier male officers and i think it’s a very clever way to hint at a rumor that may or may not be true but the writers have this huge love story that they had to follow through which is with peggy shippen at the end of season 2 things aren’t going well for andre monmouth courthouse backfires and peggy is in the arms of benedict arnold where will we find andre in season 3 what’s wonderful about where we’ve ended up with andre at the end of 2 and then into the beginning of 3 and through 3 is this is a man who’s always in control and plans every minuscule detail for the first time he’s out of control and he’s out of his depth he’s not expecting to a fall in love and b make decisions of the heart instead of decisions of his mind so his judgment is impaired and he makes wild rash dangerous decisions which start to backfire and that downward spiral of his judgments and decision making is what ultimately is the demise of him i’m not saying anything which isn’t in history so i don’t think i’ll get in trouble but andre was captured for the most ludicrous things they were just bad judgment calls he was captured behind enemy lined in civilian clothing carrying documents in his boot it’s just a series of terribly terrible bad luck and bad judgment calls rather than buffoonery and stupidity andre and robert rogers are two of my favorite characters at the end of last season it feels like these two are now on a collision course can i look forward to them as potential adversaries yes absolutely it takes awhile they go off on their separate journeys but they are interwoven and rogers is hellbent to seek vengeance on andre craig has talked about extending the show past the revolution and into the baby steps of independence but obviously your days are numbered how close are we to getting to west point in the autumn of 1780 is that part of season 3 or is that still seasons away well what am i allowed to say the end of the war wouldn’t be season 3 the end of the war would be 5 season 3 is really the benedict arnold story the pinnacle of season 3 the crescendo is west point and arnold and how andre is obviously the mastermind of it i can’t say any more than that but i think you can figure that out are you familiar with  major andre monday no  laughs what is that  on mondays after the show there are lots of fans of john andre and of yourself who post the most handsome picture from that sunday’s episode wow i’m scared to join twitter and facebook because i think the adding of any more narcissism for an actor would cause an actor’s brain to explode i don’t get social media it’s completely bizarre but i’m going to be a complete hypocrite and dive into major andre monday
