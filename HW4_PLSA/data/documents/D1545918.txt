baptism baptism study index introduction 331 it is not rightly dividing the word of truth32 the apostles never baptized using those names33 baptized into the name matthew 2819 gr εἰς τὸ ὄνομα34 examine the sentence structure introduction 3when it comes to the name or words spoken during baptism there is as much disagreement in modern churches over this as there is about whether people should be sprinkled poured or immersed this is a bible study about baptism in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit  matthew 2819  showing that jesus was not referring to water baptism when he spoke these words look at the scripture gr ee k  matthew 281820  kjvκαὶ προσελθὼν ὁ ἰησοῦς ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς λέγων ἐδόθη μοι πᾶσα ἐξουσία ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς18 and jesus came and spoke to them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earthπορευθέντες οὖν μαθητεύσατε πάντα τὰ ἔθνη βαπτίζοντες αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ τοῦ υἱοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος19 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghostδιδάσκοντες αὐτοὺς τηρεῖν πάντα ὅσα ἐνετειλάμην ὑμῖν καὶ ἰδού ἐγὼ μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν εἰμι πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἕως τῆς συντελείας τοῦ αἰῶνος ἀμήν 20 teaching them to observe all things whatever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world amen matthew 281820 rpt and after he came jesus spoke to them saying all authority was given to me in heaven and on earth 19 go therefore make disciples of all the nations baptizing them into the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit 20 teaching them to keep all things whatever i commanded you and behold i am with you all the days until the end of the age amen there are some churches today who use this scripture to justify baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit even though the early church never did it see 4 baptism lord jesus christ  nevertheless these being the words of jesus they have been given preference to the other scriptures which seem to contradict it this scripture however refers to the true spiritual baptism of which water baptism is just a small part and for the following reasons it should not be used to justify speaking the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit during water baptism31 it is not rightly dividing the word of truth using the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit during water baptism is a failure to rightly divide and correctly interpret the scripture and fails on at least five points 1 out of the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established  deuteronomy 1915 matthew 1816 john 817 2 corinthians 131 as there are no other witnesses scriptures to support this point it fails here 2 do not diminish from gods word  deuteronomy 42 1232 revelation 2219 any attempt to interpret scriptures without a thorough study is diminishing from gods word and it applies to all teachings which rely on one scripture only 3 make sense of the apparent contradictions  nehemiah 88 those who use the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit for water baptism need to satisfactorily explain why the apostles never did it why did peter instruct baptism in the name of jesus christ  acts 238  and if this was wrong why did the other eleven apostles who were with him  acts 214 not rebuke him jesus promised that when the holy spirit came which they had all just received he would bring to your remembrance all things that i said to you  john 1426  so if using the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit was the correct formula for water baptism why didnt the holy spirit bring it to their remembrance at this time and correct peter why did philip baptize the samaritans in the name of the lord jesus  acts 816  why did peter command the baptism of cornelius and his household in the name of the lord  acts 1048  and if this was wrong why did the other six jewish brethren from joppa  acts 1023 1045 1112 not object also when the angel instructed cornelius to send for peter he said to him he shall tell you what you ought to do  acts 106  do we now assume that the angel instructed cornelius wrongly because peter gave the instruction for baptism in the name of the lord why did paul rebaptize the ephesians in the name of the lord jesus  acts 195  do we have good scriptural answers to these questions gods words are all plain to him who understands  proverbs 89  so when it is correctly understood all apparent contradictions can be satisfactorily explained a failure to be able to do this is a failure to have rightly divided the word of god 4 consider the context the whole context of this scripture is not to do with water baptism but to do with the authority that jesus had  matthew 2818  which he had previously passed on to his disciples  matthew 101 luke 91 1019  he was now instructing them how to bring others to the place to receive by not considering the context the true meaning of this scripture has been missed by those who use it to indicate the method of water baptism 5 check the original language no scripture can be properly understood from faulty translations and as no known perfect translations are available 2011 a good working knowledge of greek and hebrew is essential this study will prove this point32 the apostles never baptized using those names the apostles had a very good knowledge of new testament greek many could argue that not only did they speak it fluently because it was the common language of most mediterranean countries in those days but they also wrote the new testament in it however when they baptized new converts they did not do it in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit as jesus appears to have instructed here they baptized them in the name of jesus christ  acts 238  and in the name of the lord  acts 1048  were the apostles deliberately disobedient to the words of jesus or was it rather that they had a better understanding of the language than the modern churches today and knew that jesus was not referring to the words spoken over a water baptism when he said this luke 2445 then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures an analysis of the greek scripture will clarify33 baptized into the name matthew 2819 gr εἰς τὸ ὄνομαthe two differences between the phrase εἰς τὸ ὄνομα gtr eis to onoma and the other ones used  acts 238 1048  are firstly that this is the accusative case where the others are dative case see 41 42 43 baptism lord jesus christ  and secondly the preposition εἰς gtr eis is used here instead of ἐν gtr en and ἐπὶ gtr epi although it can vary in meaning according to the context the preposition εἰς primarily means into when used with a transitive verb and implies motion from the outside of something to the inside dfh p105 wp p116 it can mean in in some cases so let us look at two examples 1 when used with a verb which does not imply motion john 211 and his disciples believed in  εἰς him john 75 for neither did his brethren believe in  εἰς him 2 when it is used to show a location where prior motion into is implied matthew 223 and he came and dwelt in  εἰς a city called nazareth matthew 1333 leaven which a woman took and hid in  εἰς three measures of meal john 2026  then came jesus  and stood in  εἰς the midst it is used with the verb βαπτίζω gtr baptidzō which means i baptize in this latter sense where it says jesus came  and was baptized by john in  εἰς jordan  mark 19  but as baptism is a transitive verb implying motion unless the context dictates otherwise the preposition εἰς following it should be translated into see 2 the preposition εἰς is only ever used with the accusative case dfh p105 wp p114 which usually refers to the direct object in this case the thing being baptized into it is never used with the dative case or in an instrumental sense with one exception by jerusalem  matthew 535  where the context is oaths therefore the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit is what the believer is being baptized into  see 5 into father son holy spirit  and not that which is used to perform the act34 examine the sentence structure the beginning of matthew 2819 literally reads go therefore make disciples of all nations baptizing them  the word translated make disciples of gr μαθητεύσατε gtr matheteusate kjv teach is the main verb of the sentence and is an aorist imperative in the greek it shows that this is what is being commanded to be done and includes not only teaching but also the learning by the student and obedience to what has been learned the word translated go gr πορευθέντες gtr poreuthentes kjv go you is not a greek imperative that is not a command but rather an aorist participle which usually indicates something that has to be done before the main verb dfh p57 jww p152 wp p96 it cannot be applied in this sense in this particular context because it would not make sense in the parallel scripture mark 1615 and he said to them go having gone into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature in this context therefore there are some scholars who would translate this word as an imperative that is a command even though it is a participle in the greek because the participle takes on the nature of the main verb which is an imperative many other similar examples could be quoted matthew 28  go and search diligently for the young child matthew 220  arise and take the young child   matthew 229  go therefore into the highways luke 1410  go and sit down in the lowest room acts 96  arise and go into the city 2 timothy 411  take mark and bring him with you the point to note is that in the kjv the main verb of the sentence is teach and not go you following the main verb we have two other verbs baptizing and teaching both of which are present participles in the greek the present participle usually refers to an action simultaneous with the main verb wp p96 dfh p57 jww p152 indicating that the teaching the baptizing and the discipling are all going on at the same time it also indicates that the baptizing and the teaching are both going on for the same length of time as the make disciples of this should make it clear that the word baptizing  matthew 2819 is not referring only to the relatively instantaneous ordinance of water baptism but rather to the much longer process of being spiritually baptized into obedience in thought  2 corinthians 105  word and deed  romans 1518  this is done as the word of god is written in our hearts  2 corinthians 33  and we learn to observe all things  matthew 2820 that jesus has commanded us the word disciple also means learner so this could be translated make learners of  baptizing them  teaching them  which gives support to this view because it seems logical that the learning would have to go on at the same time as the teaching doesnt it the participles baptizing and teaching  matthew 281920 could then be considered in three ways 1 as participles of means in this case the participle indicates the means by which the action of the main verb is carried out examples matthew 627 which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature matthew 281920 make disciples of  by baptizing  by teaching grammatically this interpretation is certainly a possibility 2 as participles of attendant circumstance in this case the participle indicates some action going on at the same time as the main verb and is dependent on it but is a different action to that of the main verb it is therefore possible for the action of the main verb to be done without the action of the participles examples matthew 935 jesus went about  teaching  preaching  and healing  matthew 2122 ask in prayer believing we can rule this out as a possible interpretation because it would mean that the make disciples of could be done without baptizing or teaching and this is not possible 3 as participles of identical action in this case the participle describes the action of the main verb from a different point of view but is identical to it examples matthew 52 he  taught them saying  matthew 2818 jesus  spoke to them saying this would mean that the make disciples of and the baptizing both in a physical and a spiritual sense are the same process and that the make disciples of and the teaching are the same process if we understand that jesus command was to make perfect disciples then the make disciples of and the baptizing are certainly the same process both being completed only when perfection is obtained however make disciples of involves much more than teaching it involves the student learning and conforming his life to obedience so the most we could say in this context is that teaching is only part of the process but the make disciples of cannot be completed without it  ephesians 41113  the favoured interpretation here then is that the participles baptizing and teaching are participles of identical action with a secondary meaning of means water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ bible quiz if you have
