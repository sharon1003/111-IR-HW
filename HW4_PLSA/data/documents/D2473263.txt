ozone the gas that can heal  the gas that can kill by dr david minkoff oxygen as we all know is an element essential to life itself and the oxygen we breathe usually comes in pairs of atoms or o2 under certain conditions some pairs of oxygen break apart and each atom joins another pair to make ozone o3 when found naturally in the lower atmosphere ozone can be best described as a travelling pollutant this ozone is found closest to earth and is manmade an indirect result of air pollution created by automobile exhaust and emissions from factories and power plants it is commonly known as smog and in certain areas of the us such a big cities the smog is so bad that pollution levels routinely exceed safety standards set by the u s environmental protection agency people who inhale ozone during repeated exposure may permanently damage their lungs or suffer from respiratory infections ozone exposure may reduce lung function or aggravate existing respiratory conditions such as asthma emphysema or bronchitis ozone may also cause chest pain coughing throat irritation or congestion ozone for medical use ozone in medical use is a story with a very different ending made by passing pure oxygen through an electric coil which gives it three atoms instead of two the addition of the third oxygen atom makes ozone “supercharged” oxygen and gives it all of its remarkable medical properties how does ozone work in the body ozone increases the amount of oxygen in the body which may help the body to heal byreducing the clogging of blood cellsdetoxifying the liverdecreasing uric acid in the bodyimproving circulation and oxygen supplydecreasing fat cholesterol and triglycerideskilling viruses bacteria and fungusimproving the activity of the white blood cellsimproving the metabolism of cellsslowing down the aging process ozone therapy can be used to treat a variety of chronic disease including cardiovascular disease diabetes lyme disease chronic hepatitis herpes chronic fatigue states chemical sensitivity macular degeneration chronic bladder conditions migraine headaches colitis autoimmune diseases and crohn’s disease ozone therapies at life works wellness center we are having great success treating patients with the ozone therapies we offer  here is a description of the different ways we use ozone at our clinic chezone chezone is a combination of chelation therapy and ozone therapy first the ozone therapy is delivered by major autohemotherapy as described below this is immediately followed by chelation therapy which is an intravenous treatment which helps rid the body of heavy metals chezone can also cause the mobilization of the calcium deposits so it is also used to treat the effects of hardening of the arteries leading to heart attacks and strokes cystozone cystozone is used to treat the bladder in cases of interstitial cystitis or acute infection a urinary catheter is inserted into the bladder and some medication is infused into the bladder after 20 minutes ozone is also infused into the bladder where it remains for a further 20 minutes in the case of acute infections this procedure is carried out daily in chronic inflammation it is repeated 23 times a week until symptoms subside major autohemotherapy mahmah is the most common and in most cases the most effective way ozone is administered the patient relaxes in a chair in the iv room and has 100250ml of blood removed into a sterilized iv bag then ozone is injected into the bag which is gently shaken allowing the red and white blood cells to take up the ozone the ozonated blood is then returned to the body via iv drip the entire procedure takes about 3060 minutes it can be valuable in the treatment of heart disease and circulatory disorders chronic infections such as hepatitisc herpes lyme and aids may also respond very favorably to mah it can also very helpful in chronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia and autoimmune diseases otozone with the otozone protocol ozone

up to a maximum of 10 minutes the procedure is painless and in some cases may bring almost immediate relief prolozone prolozone uses the power of oxygen to cause damaged tissues joints ligaments and tendons to regenerate to begin with a solution called a proliferant a proliferant is something that makes something grow or expand is injected directly into the site where the weakened ligament attaches to the bone then the area is infiltrated with ozone giving the tissues what they need to heal the response to treatment varies from person to person but most people only need from 35

gastrointestinal disorders such as ibs colitis and crohn’s disease a small amount between 200500ml of the ozone is delivered to the intestine via an intestinal catheter which is inserted into the rectum this does not cause discomfort and the ozone is absorbed by the intestine topical ozone this form of ozone treatment is delivered in a bag making it a particularly useful way of treating limbs
