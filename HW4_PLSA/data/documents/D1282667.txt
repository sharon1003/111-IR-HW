frequently asked questions taste and  or odorit is very difficult to separate taste from odor because these two human senses are so closely related most occurrences of a peculiar taste or odor that you may experience can be grouped into one of the following two categories1 chlorinous bleachy 2 fishy or earthy two common causes for a chlorinous bleachy taste or odor in the water the addition of chlorine to the water by the district and the interaction of that chlorine with a buildup of organic material in your plumbing system a chlorine odor is often an indicator that the disinfectant is effectively working to remove bacteria and debris in your pipes the district uses a relatively low dose of chlorine in its system however sensitivity to taste and odor varies greatly from person to person so while one person may notice a strong smell of chlorine another may not two common causes of fishy earthy taste or odor in the water certain types of organisms growing in the district’s source water reservoirs algae fungi and bacteria excrete small amounts of chemicals into the water which can impart a taste and odor the two most common chemicals are geosmin and methylisborneal mib although these chemicals have no documented health effects most people can detect them in the water at concentrations as low as 5 parts per trillion the district works very hard to avoid having these compounds reach our customers and treats the water specifically to avoid this refrigerating the water can help eliminate the odor and adding a slice of lemon will remove any bitter taste odors that seem to emanate from your tap may be from the sink drain and not the water the plumbing beneath your sink typically the ushape pipe can collect debris over time and create an odor at your tap if you smell an odor fill a clean glass halfway with tap water and smell the water in a separate room or outdoors if the odor is no longer present the odor is likely from the plumbing beneath your sink we recommend pouring vinegar or baking soda down your drain to help clear debris and odor rusty  dirty waterwhen the water from your faucet is brown it may be the result of a disturbance in the water main even though your water is filtered over time a very fine layer of iron and sediment can develop on the bottom of the water mains that can be stirred up while the water is still safe to drink it isn’t very pleasant to look at hydraulic disturbances caused by hydrant use valve turning main breaks or adjacent construction can stir up these sediments and cause the water to be brown usually the water will clear on its own within a few hours if your water is brown dont drink the water it may not be harmful but we dont advise drinking any obviously discolored or dirty water it is fine to use this water to flush toilets avoid using hot water until the pipes clear that avoids drawing dirty water into your hot water tank after an hour or so run the cold water for several minutes to see if it is clear when one faucet runs clear run the cold water through all home faucets until each is clear this step will eliminate the dirty water that may have been drawn into your pipes if this does not go away in a few hours you should call the district at 8602787850 x 3600  to prevent dirty water from being delivered to our customers the district regularly flushes fire hydrants throughout the distribution system to clean the mains in the streets and remove scale buildup in pipes when crews flush hydrants and remove this material from the hydrant and several miles of pipe it comes out of a hydrant all at once and the water may initially look discolored if you watch our workers flush you will notice that the water clears up rather quickly cloudy waterthat appearance of a milky color is really air bubbles when the outside temperature drops our pipes get cold and so does your drinking water bring that cold water into a warm home and oxygen gas is released into the water as tiny bubbles fill a glass with water and let it stand for a few seconds if the water clears from the bottom toward the top the milky color is just the oxygen bubbles rising similar to opening a bottle of soda hard or soft waterthe districts drinking water is soft if you are a district customer you probably dont need to use special water softeners for your clothes or dishwashing machines waters hardness and softness is due to its concentration of minerals –calcium and magnesium the lower the mineral concentration the softer the water is the district’s drinking water has a hardness of approximately 15 milligrams per liter or 1 grain per gallon using water that is considered soft you do not need to use as much dishwashing soap laundry detergent or other soaps many new dishwashers allow you to set the hardness of the water so that you do not need to use as much soap in comparison to areas that have hard water fluoridethe state of connecticut health department requires the addition of fluoride to all public drinking water provided by systems serving a population of 20000 or more people a daily diet that includes small amounts of fluoride has been credited with reducing the number of cavities in children and young adults the normal fluoride level in the district’s water is 1 part per million stains on plumbing  tile  dogs dishtap water may interact with the different metals used in home plumbing systems or bacteria and produce colorful results while the stains may be bothersome your water will usually still be safe to drink and use stains and their causes include a pinkish slimy film may appear in your toilet bowl shower stall pets dish or other places where there is a relatively moist surface this film most likely results from the airborne introduction of the bacteria “serratia marcescens” into a moist environment this bacteria moves with dust in the air and is not in the water being delivered to your home however given the right environment it will proliferate rapidly reddishbrown stains on sinks or plumbing fixtures these stains are most often noticed along with brownish water they are found in homes of any age although they are most common in older homes with galvanized pipe reddish brown stains may indicate rust forming in the pipes green stains on plumbing fixtures are a result of copper leaching from the plumbing in your house and is usually associated with a continuously leaking faucet  this is not usually a problem for district customers although the problem may occur from time to time the district does adjust the p h of the water and adds an additional chemical to reduce the tendency of copper and lead to leach into your drinking water regular cleaning with common household cleaners can help control the above mentioned stains and bacterial growth on sinks or plumbing fixturesp h of district’s waterthe district treats its drinking water so that it has a p h of approximately 75 a slightly alkaline measurement this p h level helps reduce the tendency for water to leach metal out of your household plumbing untreated raw water in the district’s reservoirs has a p h of approximately 68 close to neutralp h measures the amount of hydrogen ion activity in a substance the p h scale is relative and runs from 0 to 14 0 is the lowest and most acidic p h level 7 is neutral 14 is the highest and most alkaline p h level sodiumthe district tests for sodium regularly and the amount of sodium in the drinking water averages 84 milligrams per liter about 2 milligrams per glass this is considered to be a very low level of sodium by the fda sodium in water contributes only a small fraction of a persons overall sodium intake colored particles in your faucet aerator and fixturesusually colored particles in drinking water indicate the dip tube in your hot water heater is disintegrating the dip tube is a long tube inside the water heater it connects to the cold water pipe at the top of the heater and takes the cold water down to the base of the water heater to the heating element the majority of water heaters made in the 1990s utilized a dip tube made of plastic pvc which breaks down it starts to break down from the bottom and over time the flecks get into your pipes while the majority of particles are white household plumbing can alter their color copper plumbing can turn them bluegreen while galvanized iron can turn them a reddish color they clog the faucets with screens and hot water hoses which are connected to appliances they will clog up shower heads as the dip tube gets shorter and shorter you have less and less hot water the water heater has to work much harder to heat up water since the cold water takes up more space when this happens the dip tube needs to be replaced contact the manufacturer to get the best information on replacement many people will want to call a plumber who can flush the hot water heater at the same time the flecks are not toxic or harmful if you have filters attached to your plumbing system or a water pitcher that uses carbon filters to remove contaminants these can also contribute to the presence of black particles the small carbon particles of these filters are black and can pass through in your water black particles can also come from precipitated iron and manganese in water which may come loose from pipe walls after a large main break or major construction another common cause of black particles in tap water is the disintegration of rubber materials used in plumbing fixtures plumbing gaskets and orings disintegrate over time and can collect in toilet tanks and around faucets flushing the system and your taps will likely resolve the issue of black particles caused by plumbing fixtures or construction if black particles are from your filter you should replace the filter as recommended by the manufacturer white residue is commonly found in showers and kitchenware as the result of dissolved minerals found in water such as calcium and magnesium mineral particles can also be visible in ice cubes made with tap water these minerals are not a risk to human health but can build up on surfaces over time commercial products are available to remove white residue caused by minerals in water if you wish to do a further test you could take some of these particles and put them in a glass with some vinegar the plastic will not melt minerals will dissolve
