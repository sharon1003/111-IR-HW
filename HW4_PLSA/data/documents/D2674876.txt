kuru definition kuru is the name of a progressively disabling and ultimately fatal brain infection caused by a unique protein particle called a prion description kuru was first described in a specific tribal group in papua new guinea the word kuru means to shake or tremble in this tribal groups language individuals in new guinea are believed to have acquired the infection through a cannibalistic ritual involving the blood and brains of deceased tribal members because infection with kuru may occur years or decades before the advent of actual symptoms of the disease it belongs to a group of diseases originally known as slow virus infections currently slow virus infections are classed together as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tse tses include kuru creutzfeldtjakob disease  gerstmannstr ä usslerscheinker syndrome and fatal familial insomnia the tse new variant called creutzfeldtjakob disease also known colloquially as mad cow disease has received a great deal of public attention the tses including kuru involve abnormal clumps of protein that accumulate throughout the brain destroying brain tissue and leaving spongy holes demographics kuru reached epidemic proportions among tribal members in the 1950s since the practice of cannibalism was halted the disease has essentially disappeared some sources suggest that as few as zero to 10 cases of kuru are diagnosed each year causes and symptoms kuru is caused by an infectious protein particle called a prion which stands for proteinaceous infectious particle a prion is similar to a virus except that it lacks any nucleic acid which prevents it from reproducing prions are abnormal versions of proteins that are found in the membranes of normal cells these abnormal proteins can be passed directly to individuals through the ingestion of prioninfected tissue or when open sores on the recipients skin are exposed to prioninfected tissue in addition to being transmissible as are other infectious agents like viruses or bacteria prions are unique because they can also be acquired through genetic inheritance symptoms of kuru tend to begin in later middle age years or decades after the prion was actually acquired early symptoms include lack of energy intense fatigue  headache  weight loss joint pain  difficulty walking twitchy muscles personality changes mood swings memory problems and bizarre behavior as the disease progresses the individual experiences stiff muscles involuntary movements problems talking hallucinations increased confusion blindness and sometimes dementia  death often occurs within three months to two years of the initial symptoms diagnosis diagnosis is arrived at through characteristic abnormalities found on the electroencephalogram eeg a test of brain waves and electricity seventyfive percent of individuals with kuru will display these specific abnormalities on eeg mri studies and biopsies tissue samples from the brain may also show changes that are characteristic of slow virus infection treatment team diagnosis of slow virus infection is usually made by a neurologist  treatment there are no available treatments for kuru it is relentlessly progressive incurable and fatal supportive care for the patient and his or her family is the only treatment prognosis kuru is always fatal resources booksberger joseph r and avindra nath slow virus infections cecil textbook of medicine edited by thomas e andreoli et al philadelphia w b saunders company 2000 murray t jock and william prysephillips infectious diseases of the nervous system noble textbook of primary care medicine edited by john noble et al st louis w b saunders company 2001 periodicalssy mansun pierluigi gambetti and wong boonseng human prion diseases medical clinics of north america 86 may 2002 551 – 571 websitesnational institute of neurological disorders and stroke ninds kuru fact sheet bethesda md ninds 2003 rosalyn carsonde witt md
