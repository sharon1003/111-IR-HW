knitting blog use your stash using knitting yarns for weaving by breeanna sveum on april 21 2014 add to favorites if you’re a knitter looking to get into weaving you might think you need to buy yarn specifically made for weaving there are a lot of benefits to doing that it’s much easier to warp from a cone than from a hank for example and with many more yards of yarn on the average cone than in the average skein you can warp the whole loom without tying on a new length of yarn but with the volume and variety of knitting yarns on the market and the volume and variety of yarns located in many knitters’ stashes there’s no reason not to make almost any yarn work for weaving knitting yarns will fall into two categories yarns suitable for the warp and yarns suitable for the weft while just about any yarn can be used for the weft there are some pretty specific requirements for what yarn would make a good warp choosing a warp yarn the first and possibly the most important factor is strength a warp yarn needs to be strong enough to hold up under the tension of the loom fortunately this is pretty easy to test take your desired warp yarn in both hands and give it a sharp tug if it breaks it’s probably not strong enough for a warp if you can pull fairly hard and it still won’t break it’ll probably hold up just fine most commercially available multiply wool yarns do ok as warp as do most varieties of cottons silks and linens most singleply yarns are simply not strong enough the next indicator of warp suitability is how grabby a yarn is for most plant fibers this isn’t a problem but trying to find a shed in a sticky mohair blend is usually more trouble than it’s worth this is also pretty easy to test take a length of yarn and fold it in half give the strands a roll between your palms then try to pull them apart if they separate easily it’ll probably work for the warp if they want to hold onto each other or if they start to felt together from just that cursory roll it probably won’t work because the warp threads pass by closely to each other every time you change the shed if they stick together too much it will be difficult to pass the shuttle through further considerations for weaving with knitting yarns are largely those that come up when using yarn specifically for weaving as well there’s the weight or grist of the yarn particularly as relative to reed size worsted weight yarn for example is not ideal for use in a 10 dpi reed if the yarn is too thick for the holes the constant rubbing as you move the heddle will weaken the yarn and you’re more likely to have a warp thread break which is never any fun there’s also the amount of yarn to consider knitting yarns are sold in smaller lots if you have a lot of yarn to work with calculating the exact yardage of warp you’ll need is a lot less necessary if you want to make a scarf out of one skein of handpainted sock yarn doing the math to figure out how long and wide you can make the warp will save you a lot of time in the long run of course you can always just wing it but you’ll have to be prepared for stripes or a smallerthananticipated finished object photo via craftsy member shoeboxcat choosing a weft yarn the weft is where all those yarns that weren’t right for the warp get to shine something soft that comes apart if you look at it funny perfect for the weft where that softness can shine something so hairy and sticky that you can’t get the shuttle in excellent for the weft where that grabbiness can be a plus to hold everything in place this is the perfect application for all those novelty yarns you bought to make quick scarves with but wouldn’t touch with a 10foot knitting needle ladder yarns add a nice burst of color and shine and boucle yarns weave up soft and squishy with none of the hunting for the next stitch that comes with knitting or crocheting them almost any yarn can be used for the weft preparing knitting yarns for weaving you can prepare yarn for weaving in much the same way you’d prepare them for knitting warping a loom involves pulling yarn out at a much faster rate than just knitting so a centerpull cake is perfect for this the flat bottom of a cake allows it to stay where you put it a hand wound ball on the other hand has a tendency to jump and roll all over the room if you don’t have a ball winder you can still prevent the ball from rolling everywhere just place the ball in a box or drawer closing or sealing it enough so there’s only room for a strand of yarn and the ball won’t pop out at you yarn that is already packaged in centerpull skeins can be used asis like it were a cake as you pull yarn out of the middle of the skein it will flatten and generally stay where it’s put by following these simple guidelines and testing yarn for strength and stickiness you will have no problem using knitting yarns for weaving make that stash work for youhave you woven something using knitting yarns tell us about it6 comments barry almand january 17th 2016long time knitter now learning how to weave very informative thanks reply pam february 8th 2016exactly the information i was looking for and wellwritten thanks so much going to give weaving a try reply cath may 15th 2016i was looking for this info…thanks reply belinda august 7th 2016i would value a chart that gave suggested dpi for the various weights or thicknesses of yarns sold for knitting eg i saw someone say 12dpi too loose for sock 4 ply she went up to 15dpi but that wore the yarn in the end she used 16dpi but 2 threads at a time in an 8 reed this sort of thing is hard to find out yourselfreply ruth lawrenceblackwell april 20th 2017just starting out and i’m fascinated with the options thanks for your advice reply kylie september 8th 2017thanks also like others above this is exactly what i wanted to know cones can be pricey and i’m wanting to get back into weaving after a long time and was wondering if i can start with some wool for the warp i have been looking at ops shops lately and there are so many bags of brand new wool if you look around i’d prefer this to practice with first reply leave a reply your
