about us cnas approach to research is a modern iteration of the newtonian principle that complex dynamic processes are best understood through direct observation of events and people that was the methodology cna analysts first applied in the 1940s when they pioneered the field of operations research by helping the navy address the german uboat threat not content to study the problem from afar this small group of mit scientists insisted on deploying with navy forces in order to observe operations and collect the data needed for meaningful analyses their groundbreaking work and the antisubmarine warfare equations it produced set a standard for operations research methods that cna has maintained for 75 years today with more than 500 professionals at our headquarters and 50 researchers in the field cna still takes a multidisciplinary realworld approach to our work onsite analysts carefully observe all aspects of a process—people decisions actions consequences—and then collaborate with a headquartersbased research team to assess data and arrive at findings cnas objective empirical research and analysis helps decision makers develop sound policies make betterinformed decisions and manage programs more effectively our work which in its early decades focused solely on defenserelated matters has grown to include investigation and analysis of a broad range of national security defense and public interest issues including education homeland security and air traffic management through our center for naval analyses and institute for public research we provide publicsector organizations with the tools they need to tackle the complex challenges of making government more efficient and keeping our country safe and strong who we are at cna we analyze and solve problems by getting as close as possible to the people the data – and the problems themselves – in order to find the clear credible answers government leaders need to choose the best course of action go to our solution centers leadership cnas leadership team is comprised of men and women drawn from the fields of business government public service and the military their decades of experience and records of accomplishment lend substantive experience to our work go to our leadership research we take a systematic evidencebased approach to problem solving we define the problem collect data through observation and experiment and formulate and test hypotheses to deliver impartial answers grounded in a thorough understanding of the issues go to our research note to reporters and editors cna is not an acronym and is correctly referenced as cna a nonprofit research and analysis organization located in arlington va
