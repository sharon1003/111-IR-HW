list now includes things like lean proteins eggs beans lentils tofu nonfat plain yogurt and all your favorite veggies and fruit please note this is the expected list for the new plan coming out in december and already out in the ulk under the name flex plan this has not been verified by weight watchers for the us yet update this list has been confirmed one of the main features of the weight watchers program is their point system all foods are given a points value and your goal on the program is to stay within your daily points allowance however anyone who has dieted before knows that when hunger strikes it can be difficult to stay on track thats why weight watchers offers a wide variety of healthy food options that have zero smart points these zero points foods can be eaten freely on the plan and are a great way to stay within your daily target under the newest weight watchers plans  freestyle in the us and flex in the uk  there are a bunch of new zero points foods hooray the new list now includes lean proteins like eggs chicken breast and turkey it also includes beans and legumes like chickpeas black beans and lentils as well as nonfat plain yogurt and tofu this is in addition to the fruits and vegetables that were zero points in the previous plans personally i couldnt be more excited about all these new options it will make it much easier to create a lower point meal and since protein is now a part of the list it will be easier to stay full with zero points options my only concern is that it will be much easier to potentially overeat the new zero points foods have more calories and if you are eating too many it could be possible to gain weight on the new plan new weight watchers zero points foods the new flex and freestyle plan now include lean animal and plant based protein sources like chicken turkey eggs tofu lentils beans and yogurt plus you can now enjoy sweetcorn and peas for free on the new plans specifically here are the new zero points foods for the new ww plans boneless skinless chicken breast boneless skinless turkey breast ground lean chicken ground lean turkey thin sliced deli chicken breast thin sliced deli turkey breast all fish and shellfish this does not include smoked or dried fishcanned fish that is packed in water or brine ie canned tuna or canned salmon in watertofu and smoked tofu quorn fillets ground quorn and quorn pieces meat substituteeggs nonfat plain regular and greek yogurt plain soy yogurt fresh frozen and canned beans and lentils that are packed without oil or sugar lentils chickpeas black beans pinto beans kidney beans split peas soy beans and morezero point vegetables just like on the previous plans most vegetables are zero points on the new flex and freestyle plans this means you can enjoy most nonstarchy vegetables for zero points on the plan just be aware that you do need to count any oil or butter the vegetables are cooked with there are a few vegetables that are not zero points including potatoes sweet potatoes yams parnips cassava mushy peas yuca and olives this includes fresh frozen and canned vegetables as long as they arent packed with any additional oil sugars or fats zero point fruits on the new weight watchers plans almost all fruits are zero points but they should be eaten in moderation since they can quickly add up the only exceptions to this are avocados and plantains also it is important to know that when you blend fruit in a smoothie it is no longer counted as zero points the reason for this is that a smoothie contains much more fruit than we would normally eat in one sitting for example someone would rarely sit down and eat a banana a cup of berries a mango and some pineapple in one sitting but isnt rare to see this in a large smoothie this includes fresh fruit as well as frozen canned or jarred fruit as long as it is packed without additional sugar zero point condiments flavor enhancers and spices the last category of zero points food in the ww plans are for things like spices low calorie and low sugar condiments and many things we use to enhance the flavor in recipes some examples of these ingredients include things like vinegars broth fresh and dried spices and rubs mustard hot sauce capers and salsa please note that some of these ingredients do have points depending on the amount you are using they may be zero points for a small serving but if you are using more in a recipe they may contain more points a word of caution on zero point foods there is no doubt that zero points foods are one of the things that people love the most about the weight watchers program but for some they can lead to slower weight loss if they are overused this is especially true when it comes to lean proteins beans and legumes eggs and fruit generally you should try to eat zero points foods in moderation and only until you are full try not to overeat watching portion sizes even if it is zero point food for example even though eggs are zero points with the new plan it still isnt a good idea to have a 4 or 6 egg omelette for breakfast instead opt for a 23 egg omelette which is closer to a standard portion size additionally if you find your weight loss is slowing or plateauing it may be a good idea to look at how you are using zero point foods many people find that they may be over using these foods and when they cut back their weight loss picks up again again this is just a strategy to consider if your weight loss isnt progressing as you would like if it is  then just keep doing what you are doinglearn more about the new weight
