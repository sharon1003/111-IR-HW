and grand canyon trip i am planning a trip to these 3 parks we will be getting in at grand canyon saturday night plan to spend sunday there until sunset and drive to bryce canyon stay in bryce sunday night wake up 530 am monday see sunrise and then drive around and do a short hike or 2 leaving bryce about 2pm and driving to zion take the shuttle tour stay there overnight and monday morning do a hike or 2 and leave to vegas about 12pm is that doable thanks in advance ps we would go to sleep at nightfall and wake up sunrise jul 2nd 2012 1202 pm  2j62join date mar 2005posts 9670sunset next sat is about 8pm at the grand canyon if youre in the car at 801 sharp and do the 5hr drive to bryce nonstop youll arrive around midnight 1201 precisely assuming you fall asleep by 1230 that gives you 5hrs sleep feasible yes then you can check all 3 parks off your been there done that list enjoyable memorable not for me ymmv jul 2nd 2012 1240 pm  3dougstallings join date jun 2004posts 9940its technically possible if you have reservations already but id feel more comfortable with at least one or two more days otherwise i think youd be better off just spending an extra night near zion and treating bryce as basically a drivethrough with stops at a couple of overlooks delaying you a couple of hours on the way to zion this is a very punishing schedule as j62 points out jul 2nd 2012 1252 pm  4elendil pickle join date apr 2004posts 11426if this is all the time you have its doable but i wouldnt want to drive between the grand canyon and bryce at night  too many deer on the roads i would leave the grand canyon earlier in the day especially since we didnt find it as interesting as bryce or zion lee ann jul 2nd 2012 0124 pm  5spirobulldog join date jul 2007posts 7443do you mean north rim or south rim of the gc frankly i would narrow it down to one park you can do the grand canyon in one day if you just want to look at it hiking down into it andor rafting it takes much longer but is certainly well worth it at both bryce and zion there is easily enough to keep you busy there for 23 days you cant really do a hike or two before noon at either place the shuttle at zion isnt really that much of a tour its more of a way to get from point to point and eliminates all the cars there some of the drivers do give great comments along the way others not all that much jul 2nd 2012 0358 pm  6tomsd join date nov 2011posts 11375i am a road warrior or used to be more of one anyway  and i think you have a fairly aggressive schedule having said that  if you enjoy driving and watching the scenery pass by and want to see all three  perhaps to return to one or two in the future  go for it but  having grown up in deer country  in oregon  i would also hesitate to try and drive 5 hours at night  and even if iyou know how to spot them fairly easily  you can still hit one when you least expect it if you had to cut out one place  simply due to how it sits geographically  i would nix bryce and i thought the shuttle gave you a nice overview at zion jul 2nd 2012 0442 pm  7where are we join date aug 2008posts 2104what would i do go to zion on saturday night spend all day there on sunday then drive 15 hours to bryce drive into the park and just stop somewhere to look at the sky if its a clear night bryce has virtually no light pollution so you can see a lot more stars than youre used to go back to your hotel and get a good nights sleep monday morning get up early for sunrise then do a short hike leave for the grand canyon in time to get to the east entrance by 630pm or so its about a 5 hour drive to the east entrance you will have to also account for the time change between utah and arizona depending on which month you are going give yourself some time to take in various viewpoints on your way to the main village  the drive takes about 45 minutes without stopping sunset at 8pm pick whichever viewpoint you want just be aware that by actual sunset time the canyon will be completely dark so theres not much to see below the rim you may want to get there before 630 to give yourself more time to watch the shadows engulf the canyon tuesday morning up early for sunrise and some hiking then leave for vegas by 10 or 11 again adjusting for the time zone change and longer travel time vs zion 3 big reasons i would reverse the order of your trip 1 zion deserves more time than youve allotted and there are more easy hikes there than the grand canyon basically at the grand canyon most people look at viewpoints walk along the rim and maybe go down bright angel a little ways so many more hikes to do at zion with a lot more variety since it is 2 hours closer to vegas than the grand canyon you may even be able to dosee something on saturday evening when you arrive 2 youll make a 15 hour drive to bryce after dark instead of a 5 hour drive much less chance of hitting animals on the road youll get there at a reasonable hour so you can get a decent nights rest and youd be able to go see the stars without really losing much sleep 3 youd give yourself the chance to make a couple stops between bryce and grand canyon with my itinerary horseshoe bend and antelope canyon because youre making the drive in daylight not saying you have to make time for either of those but at least you would have the option all of this is based on the assumption that you are going soon hence the 8pm sunset time and that you can actually switch your lodging arrangements around jul 2nd 2012 0702 pm  8hang20join date mar 2010posts 171we did this trip last summer spent a lot more time in each location and did the nrgc north rim was only 23 hours from zion we loved it our trip went capitol reef not in your trip bryce north rim zion then back to vegas for our flight i agree you need more time and i would not consider the shuttle at zion anything but transportation you can search my trip report for more details enjoy it is a beautiful part of the country jul 2nd 2012 0716 pm

10toucan join date jun 2011posts 265dont underestimate the time it can take to drive through zion park at busy summer and even shoulder seasons it can easily take 1 hour or more one way to get from springdale through the tunnels and out the east entrance of the park to hwy 89 if youre in a hurry it can be frustratingly slow jul 3rd 2012 0835 am  11myer join date jan 2003posts 5764i am not a fan of gc two years ago i took my daughter on a 3 day plus travel to and from trip we did a lot but never rushed its all in the distances and knowing where youre going next the drive to bryce is long in my opinion sunset in any of these parks is not their strong point if you are intent on seeing gc than get up on sunday morning drive to several of the gc viewpoints then hike down for 45 min to an hour then by early to midafternoon leave for bryce while the sunset at sunset point is not a big deal its better in my opinion than that at gc youll at least not drive to bryce in the dark and get to bed at a reasonable time yes get up when its still dark and get over to bryce point it juts out into the canyon for a spectacular sunrise you can see my photos at wwwtravelwalkscom  grab a bite for breakfast or a quick nap and hike down navajo loop and up queens garden leave for zion as planned and on the way in the east entrance park in the small parking lot just before the tunnel and hike canyon overlook great views of the canyon for the amount of effort on this relatively short hike then depending upon the time you may get in riverside walk its called a walk and it is however the canyon scenery is worth it the next morning you can do any from a selection of hikes i think its all in what time you leave gc jul 3rd 2012 0536 pm  12happytrailstoyou join date feb 2005posts 10963i am not a fan of gc i wouldnt be a fan either if we hadnt stayed in a lodge on the rim for two nights this made it possible for us to enjoy the canyon in the morning before the daytrippers arrived and in the evening after they left httyjul 4th 2012 0259 am  13myer join date jan 2003posts 5764happytrailstoyou yes i have stayed on the rim and so has my daughter on a different trip when you consider all of the sights in the area gc falls close to the bottom i would much rather spend a couple of days in the red rocks surrounding sedona stop in page and go to antelope canyon and horseshoe bend i would prefer spending a few days in bryce canyon and surrounding area and zion and a little further east a few days in the moab area and arches how does gc compare jul 4th 2012 0319 am  14tomsd join date nov 2011posts 11375big fan of the grand canyon  and its called that for a reason sounds like this is more of an initialcheck it out type trip  so i definitely would try to include the gc on this trip  and then next time  you can decide if you want to spend more time there  or hiking in zion driving from bryce toward capital reef maybe getting over to arches or down to monument valley etc and as suggested  you might also consider doing the loop in reverse  first getting over from vegas and settled in zion and enjoying that  then the nextr day  seeing bryce which is very nice  but 3rd ranked among these three imo  and then down to the gc and back to vegas jul 4th 2012 0129 pm  15happytrailstoyou join date feb 2005posts 10963how does gc compare what i like most about the grand canyon is that it is incomprehensiblelike the seas or the heavens httytags arizona utah« previous thread  reviewscomments on caravan tours »thread tools search this thread show printable version email
