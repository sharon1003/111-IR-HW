more business credibility in the business market you may want to form an llc instead of a dba for example if your trade name is deas xyztch  inc co requires a fictitious business name registration which also requires a fee to be registered registering a fictitious business name does not protect that name nor does it protect the business owner from personal liability related to business actions as setting up a limited liability company llc does our recommendation that since you need to pay a fee to register the business name simply form a limited liability company llc for a similar fee and get both corporate status and protection for the name as well as personal liabilities so for instance if someone slips and falls in your business premises they can sue you personally if you are not a limited liability company llc also consider the prestige that a limited liability company llc affords is a name like johns transmissiona shop better than aemcoo trans llc q i am just one person do i need an llc a even if you are just one person owner you can form an llc limited liabiliity company q do i need an ein for my llc a yes you will need an ein for your llc to do your llc taxes and open an llc bank account q do i need to file a dba if i form an llc a if you form an llc and you do business as the llc name you dont need a dba for example your llc name is ultra super llc and your business name is ultra super llc you dont need to file a dba q if i set up an llc will the llc help me protect my business llc from creditors a yes actually only an llc can help you protect the llc from its creditors especially if you have another partner member owner in that llc q do i need to obtain a federal or state tax id number before forming a limited liability company llc or getting
