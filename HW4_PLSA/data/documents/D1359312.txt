attitudes » cognitive dissonance cognitive dissonanceby saul mc leod updated 2018cognitive dissonance refers to a situation involving conflicting attitudes beliefs or behaviors this produces a feeling of discomfort leading to an alteration in one of the attitudes beliefs or behaviors to reduce the discomfort and restore balance etc for example when people smoke behavior and they know that smoking causes cancer cognition they are in a state of cognitive dissonance cognitive dissonance was first investigated by leon festinger arising out of a participant observation study of a cult which believed that the earth was going to be destroyed by a flood and what happened to its members — particularly the really committed ones who had given up their homes and jobs to work for the cult — when the flood did not happen while fringe members were more inclined to recognize that they had made fools of themselves and to put it down to experience committed members were more likely to reinterpret the evidence to show that they were right all along the earth was not destroyed because of the faithfulness of the cult members how attitude change takes place festingers 1957 cognitive dissonance theory suggests that we have an inner drive to hold all our attitudes and behavior in harmony and avoid disharmony or dissonance this is known as the principle of cognitive consistency when there is an inconsistency between attitudes or behaviors dissonance something must change to eliminate the dissonance cognitive dissonance  behavior  mcat  khan academy your browser does not currently

attitudes behavior beliefs etc to make the relationship between the two elements a consonant one when one of the dissonant elements is a behavior the individual can change or eliminate the behavior however this mode of dissonance reduction frequently presents problems for people as it is often difficult for people to change welllearned behavioral responses eg giving up smoking acquire new information that outweighs the dissonant beliefs for example thinking smoking causes lung cancer will cause dissonance if a person smokes however new information such as “research has not proved definitely that smoking causes lung cancer” may reduce the dissonance reduce the importance of the cognitions ie beliefs attitudes a person could convince themself that it is better to live for today than to save for tomorrow in other words he could tell himself that a short life filled with smoking and sensual pleasures is better than a long life devoid of such joys in this way he would be decreasing the importance of the dissonant cognition smoking is bad for ones health notice that dissonance theory does not state that these modes of dissonance reduction will actually work only that individuals who are in a state of cognitive dissonance will take steps to reduce the extent of their dissonance the theory of cognitive dissonance has been widely researched in a number of situations to develop the basic idea in more detail and various factors that have been identified which may be important in attitude change this research can be divided into three main areasforced compliance behaviordecisionmakingand effort we will look at the main findings to have emerged from each area forced compliance behavior when someone is forced to do publicly something they privately really dont want to do dissonance is created between their cognition i didnt want to do this and their behavior i did it forced compliance occurs when an individual performs an action that is inconsistent with his or her beliefs the behavior cant be changed since it was already in the past so dissonance will need to be reduced by reevaluating their attitude to what they have done this prediction has been tested experimentally in an intriguing experiment festinger and carlsmith 1959 asked participants to perform a series of dull tasks such as turning pegs in a peg board for an hour as you can imagine participants attitudes toward this task were highly negative aim festinger and carlsmith 1959 investigated if making people perform a dull task would create cognitive dissonance through forced compliance behavior method in their laboratory experiment they used 71 male students as participants to perform a series of dull tasks such as turning pegs in a peg board for an hour they were then paid either 1 or 20 to tell a waiting participant a confederate that the tasks were really interesting almost all of the participants agreed to walk into the waiting room and persuade the confederate that the boring experiment would be fun cognitive dissonance part 1m4v your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions

participants who were paid 20 to lie conclusion being paid only 1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and so those who were paid 1 experienced dissonance they could only overcome that dissonance by coming to believe that the tasks really were interesting and enjoyable being paid 20 provides a reason for turning pegs and there is therefore no dissonance decision making life is filled with decisions and decisions as a general rule arouse dissonance for example suppose you had to decide whether to accept a job in an absolutely beautiful area of the country or turn down the job so you could be near your friends and family either way you would experience dissonance if you took the job you would miss your loved ones if you turned the job down you would pine for the beautiful streams mountains and valleys both alternatives have their good points and bad points the rub is that making a decision cuts off the possibility that you can enjoy the advantages of the unchosen alternative yet it assures you that you must accept the disadvantages of the chosen alternative people have several ways to reduce dissonance that is aroused by making a decision festinger 1964 one thing they can do is to change the behavior as noted earlier this is often very difficult so people frequently employ a variety of mental maneuvers a common way to reduce dissonance is to increase the attractiveness of the chosen alternative and to decrease the attractiveness of the rejected alternative this is referred to as spreading apart the alternatives brehm 1956 was the first to investigate the relationship between dissonance and decisionmaking method female participants were informed they would be helping out in a study funded by several manufacturers participants were also told that they would receive one of the products at the end of the experiment to compensate for their time and effort the women then rated the desirability of eight household products that ranged in price from 15 to 30 the products included an automatic coffee maker an electric sandwich grill an automatic toaster and a portable radio participants in the control group were simply given one of the products because these participants did not make a decision they did not have any dissonance to reduce individuals in the lowdissonance group chose between a desirable product and one rated 3 points lower on an 8point scale participants in the highdissonance condition chose between a highly desirable product and one rated just 1 point lower on the 8point scale after reading the reports about the various products individuals rated the products again findings participants in the highdissonance condition spread apart the alternatives significantly more than did the participants in the other two conditions in other words they were more likely than participants in the other two conditions to increase the attractiveness of the chosen alternative and to decrease the attractiveness of the unchosen alternative effort it also seems to be the case that we value most highly those goals or items which have required considerable effort to achieve this is probably because dissonance would be caused if we spent a great effort to achieve something and then evaluated it negatively we could of course spend years of effort into achieving something which turns out to be a load of rubbish and then in order to avoid the dissonance that produces try to convince ourselves that we didnt really spend years of effort or that the effort was really quite enjoyable or that it wasnt really a lot of effort in fact though it seems we find it easier to persuade ourselves that what we have achieved is worthwhile and thats what most of us do evaluating highly something whose achievement has cost us dear  whether other people think its much cop or not this method of reducing dissonance is known as effort justification if we put effort into a task which we have chosen to carry out and the task turns out badly we experience dissonance to reduce this dissonance we are motivated to try to think that the task turned out well a classic dissonance experiment by aronson and mills 1959 demonstrates the basic idea aim to investigate the relationship between dissonance and effort method female students volunteered to take part in a discussion on the psychology of sex in the mild embarrassment condition participants read aloud to a male experimenter a list of sexrelated words like virgin and prostitute in the severe embarrassment condition they had to read aloud obscene words and a very explicit sexual passage in the control condition they went straight into the main study in all conditions they then heard a very boring discussion about sex in lower animals they were asked to rate how interesting they had found the discussion and how interesting they had found the people involved in it results participants in the severe embarrassment condition gave the most positive rating conclusion if a voluntary experience which has cost a lot of effort turns out badly dissonance is reduced by redefining the experience as interesting this justifies the effort made critical evaluation there has been a great deal of research into cognitive dissonance providing some interesting and sometimes unexpected findings it is a theory with very broad applications showing that we aim for consistency between attitudes and behaviors and may not use very rational methods to achieve it it has the advantage of being testable by scientific means ie experiments however there is a problem from a scientific point of view because we cannot physically observe cognitive dissonance and therefore we cannot objectively measure it re behaviorism consequently the term cognitive dissonance is somewhat subjective there is also some ambiguity ie vagueness about the term dissonance itself is it a perception as cognitive suggests or a feeling or a feeling about a perception aronsons revision of the idea of dissonance as an inconsistency between a persons selfconcept and a cognition about their behavior makes it seem likely that dissonance is really nothing more than guilt there are also individual differences in whether or not people act as this theory predicts highly anxious people are more likely to do so many people seem able to cope with considerable dissonance and not experience the tensions the theory predicts finally many of the studies supporting the theory of cognitive dissonance have low ecological validity for example turning pegs as in festingers experiment is an artificial task that doesn’t happen in everyday life also the majority of experiments used students as participants which raise issues of a biased sample could we generalize the results from such experiments references aronson e
