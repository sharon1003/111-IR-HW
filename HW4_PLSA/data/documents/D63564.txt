note the times union is not responsible for posts and comments written by nonstaff members2014 u s open abandoned by william brouillette on october 22 2013 at 1243 pmprint 0in a surprising bit of news or perhaps not so depending on your views of the leaders officials of bowling tournament committee chairman of the bowling proprietors association of america john losito let slip that there will be no u s open in 2014 pete dougherty made mention of it in his weekly column posted online last night there are multiple aspects of this to discuss let’s start with the announcement itself  is it stunning or shocking unfortunately it is not there is no questioning the now long trending downward arrow when it comes to competitive bowling and specifically participation local tournaments have been fighting the slow but steady loss of entries for a couple of years now i believe it has little to do with the individual tournaments themselves with the problem being a general lack of bowlers wanting to test themselves in tournament conditions overall and there are multiple reasons for that the clubhouse leader of reasons is laziness and an apathy to wanting to get better or understanding what it takes to be good enough to compete consistently averaging 220 bowling one night a week might be enough for some and there is nothing wrong with that but the problem is that thought process seems to be spreading much more than it did in the past there are other reasons as well with one being of importance that will be tied in later reading the first article i could find where it referenced the decision to abandon the u s open in 2014 much of what john losito said struck me and for all the wrong reasons his first comment about looking to reboot the events for 2015 is fine but why should that cause the 2014 event to disappear it couldn’t be held this year under the recent format while working on a change for 2015 at the same time are the bpaa members not being paid enough to multitask his reasoning for not holding the event in 2014 is that they wouldn’t be able to do it their way the right way in time for 2014 that may lead you to ask  what is their way this is where the trouble begins citing surveys received from competitors proprietors and major manufacturers uhoh he reasoned that the current format of direct entry was faulty to that i say here we go again with turning away potential bowlers and more importantly the money their entries bring sound familiar pba john’s idea is to go back to holding qualifiers for entry into the u s open across the country as was done years and years ago perhaps john is forgetting the rapidly dwindling entries in said qualifiers which is what lead to the demise of that idea john and the bpaa’s thought process going forward is to limit the field of the u s open going for quality instead of quantity according to him further he equated bowling to golf and how it is hurting the sport by letting anyone enter the u s open it is talk like that which smacks of selfimportance which is a stance bowling can ill afford right now and i could not disagree more with multiple aspects of what he and the bpaa are saying first and foremost please cease and desist immediately correlating golf and bowling stop it just because many bowlers also golf does not mean the two are even remotely similar and they should certainly not be treated as such when it comes to formatting the money involved in golf is overflowing almost eclipsing the gdp of many small countries bowling has nowhere near that cache’ or capital and bowling does not have a tiger woods to carry it into national prominence golf runs many local qualifiers and then sectionsls to qualify for the u s open and it works as for bowling doing the same not so much the need for bowling centers nationwide to come together to support the bpaa and the u s open by holding qualifiers would be paramount and it would never happen centers have a hard time even banding together to decide the correct procedure to construct a ham sandwich let alone do something for the greater good of bowling we have seen that time and time again in the end every center will do what is best for its own interests 100 percent of the time on top of that you would be asking for centers to give up prime moneymaking time to hold qualifiers weekends are chock full of profitable birthday parties and late nights during the week after 9 pm which used to be considered dead time are now traffic jams of dollar night bowlers filling the centers that hold those events weekly you would also need to subsidize the cost of sending the winning bowler in the qualifier to the next step whether it be a regional final or the u s open itself and it’s 500 entry fee with money taken in from the entry fee of the qualifier along with potentially any money from a special 5050 run even with that the chances the center would at least break even on the qualifier are somewhat remote that leads to the other larger issue when it comes to qualifiers and tournament bowling in general and that is this it has become how many bowling balls do you have at your disposal if you truly want to compete and have a chance you need to be practicing but you also better be ready to invest between 500 and 1000 annually in new equipment many of the ball companies have gone the way of amateur staff members when it comes to sponsorship they used to pay pba members for being a part of their company promoting their products with shirts and balls during telecasts but with the decline in the game those in charge have decided it is much cheaper to simply sign quality bowlers to a contract that allows them free balls bags and shirts in lieu of any salary this means when you enter a scratch tournament of almost any kind you are going to be competing against a handful of players who have a near limitless arsenal at their disposal when the condition is difficult will you benefit from having the same wider target area as they might have with your fewer equipment options unlikely i fully understand that the best are the best because of their practice and overall talent as i am not debating that but when given an advantage of equipment on top of that the chances of beating them are much slimmer with that in mind why would a bowler who is thinking of at least trying to compete in the u s open to be able to say he tried it once in his life enter a qualifier that he has little chance of advancing out of instead of entering into the tournament itself that he has little chance of doing well in answer he wouldn’t i know of and have heard some professional bowlers complain when they are paired with your 225average league bowler because he may not be playing the proper part of the lane thereby messing up the shot that the professional should have and is expecting to break down properly this is going to sound harsh but to that i say too bad now is not the time to be turning away potential entries from any tournament let alone the biggest and most wellrespected tournament in the sport the professionals should think of each of those fish entrants to use a poker saying as human dollar signs as it’s a virtual guarantee they will be splitting that money among themselves while i appreciate that the lanes are weber’s or duke’s office perhaps it would also be incumbent upon the professionals to do their best to make sure the experience is at least somewhat pleasurable for the amateur entrants so that they maybe decide they want to return home work on their game improve their overall skill and come back to try again at the very least that’s more money that can be won from them and at best maybe that is how you start building participation back up instead of trying once again to restrict it how many people do you know of in your weekly league talk about the upcoming pba tournaments or the pba season in general compared to years ago being exclusionary is only going to further lead bowling into irrelevance the officials involved on many levels of the sport of bowling do not determine its overall importance the general public takes care of that and the only way for them to partially or fully understand is to include them in the sport not prohibit them on any level william brouillette comments are closed
