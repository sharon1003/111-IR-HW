lie detectors to be used in court lie detector tests have long been regarded as the technological equivalent of crystal ball gazing or fortune telling instead of crossing palms with silver you crisscross the body with sensors and believe the results at your peril by daniel buckland and marco giannangeli published 0000 sun apr 5 2009test courts will use polygraph the polygraph howeveris now emerging from the shadows of such daytime tv trash as the jeremy kyle show where it is trumpeted into ugly domestic squabbles as “the allimportant lie detector test” it is also about to get a huge credibility boost from a governmentbacked scheme to test sex offenders to help determine if they are fit to be returned to society the pioneering scheme starts this month in the east and west midlands and sex offenders will have to submit to compulsory polygraphs as part of their parole conditions pilot studies had dramatic results with offenders revealing up to 14 times as much information under lie detector examination as normal their disclosures proved crucial in allowing probation staff to assess their risk to the public“i don’t think it is a brave thing to do it is absolutely sensible” says don grubin professor of forensic science at newcastle university who has been in charge of developing the polygraph project for the ministry of justice “it is used widely and effectively in the states and the voluntary pilot results were positive“it is never used in isolation it is part of a package of measures that help the probation service manage postconviction offenders if someone fails staff will have their antennae alerted but if the subject passes it doesn’t mean that is the only test they have to deal with”the threeyear project applies to offenders who have served a sentence of more than one year in prison they must agree to regular polygraph testing to be considered for parole“it can change the behaviour of offenders because if they know they are taking a polygraph then they will not do things that are prohibited such as going to parks or having unsupervised contact with children” says professor grubin one of the country’s leading criminal psychiatrists he believes that polygraph results which measure breathing sweat gland activity and heart rate are vital additions to existing methods of interviewing to observation and to testing lie detectors are not recognised by courts but professor grubin is aware that the project following on from other government schemes that have introduced voicerisk technology to monitor housing benefit fraud will boost the lie detection business various lie detector and voice analysis machines are available on e bay from £75 to £1000 “i am concerned that there are no regulations on polygraphs” he says “this project will legitimise polygraphs and we don’t want that to open the door for some rogue or charlatan coming to blow its credibility the government must legislate against this”the business is already growing fuelled by those “allimportant” lie detector tests on tv shows the handful of licensed polygraph companies has doubled in recent years and they report brisk business with cases ranging from relationship issues to corporate fraud it costs about £30000 and two months at an american lie detector college to become proficient at interpreting the changes in body functions the £500 fee and swift results are proving magnetic for warring couples who would previously resort to private detectives and a lengthy and costly evidencegathering process t he process is simple and swift a quiet room and a oneonone session that lasts about two hours the tester explains the procedure reveals the questions and then wires the client up to sensors that monitor breathing cycles sweat gland activity pulse rate and blood pressure the questions with 15second gaps in between are repeated three times to take into account any nerves“a lot of tests are cancelled because people realise they will be found out it is a pretty effective deterrent” says bruce burgess one of the country’s most experienced polygraph testers who has worked on daytime tv shows“it does work and it is accurate even though some think they can bluff their way through it no matter how good a liar they are the body reacts when confronted with direct questions about whether they are lying or not it may not show in the body language and people have fooled me before i’ve put them on the polygraph then the machine tells you that they are lying there is no grey area”mr burgess who is based in leatherhead surrey but travels the country testing believes more companies will spring up as the lie detector test becomes an accepted judgment in relationship issues “more people are discovering that there is a way to find out if their partner is cheating it is easier than hiring a private detective” he says“i have had cases where someone has accidently left a phone on when they’ve been amorous with another woman and their wife heard and recorded it he steadfastly denied it it is amazing how many people think they can beat the test but end up being proved wrong”simon a 21yearold construction worker is typical of the new breed turning to lie detectors he suffered a persistent rumour that he cheated on his girlfriend of four years the gossip was elevated to a potentially disastrous level when a family member told his girlfriend that the illicit romance was fact rather than fiction he paid £550 to be subjected to a twohour ordeal that would make or break his relationship “i was nervous as hell even though i was telling the truth” he says “it was not a nice experience and even though i had faith in it i could not help wondering ‘what if it goes wrong ”simon now has the hard evidence but only time will tell if the trust can be reestablished “the doubt does take the gloss of our relationship because there is the fact that she doesn’t trust me” he says“i can live with that because this came from someone who was very close to her i’ve been with her for four years so it was worth doing”the growth of the business seems inevitable as does the erosion of natural trust people used to swear on their mother’s life that they were telling the truth soon they will need to be brandishing a lie detector results chart to have the same effect
