was very underwhelming typical angsty and unlikeable main character mal falls in love with the good looking but understanding guy barely any plot other than that all the main characters get on your nerves except for me carlos was a standout this movie doesnt really teach kids anything in fact it gives them the false impression that people who have school spirit and get good grades are dorky and lame basically this movie is an hour and a half of the music video for avril lavignes girlfriend oh and the songs are terrible just awful made my ears bleed in conclusion its really not worth watching if you want to watch an excellent disney channel original movie try wendy wu or now you see it those are great6 of 13 people found this review helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report this
