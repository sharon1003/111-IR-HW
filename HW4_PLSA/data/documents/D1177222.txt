homemade bologna for the new year« on january 03 2012 010422 pm »heres my first go in the new year at making bologna ive had many requests form the boys to make some  but i wanted to make something unlike the smooth pink stuff one now finds in the supermarkets i remember year ago getting a coursertextured strongerflavored bologna from our local butcher shop that you had to peel each slice before eating good stuff made great fried bologna sandwiches so here we go i had 5 pounds of extralean ground beef 9010 and a 5lb pork shoulder onhand the ingredients to be added to the meat shown below cubed the 5lbs of pork and prepped to grind used a 45mm plate the first time through i then added the 5lbs of lean ground beef to the pork i dissolved the cure and kosher salt into 8 oz of water  then added it to the meat mixed in the solution well and let the mixture sit overnight in the fridge next day i added all the spices and dissolved the spc and nonfat dry milk in water and pour the solution into the meat  spice mixture the mixture really had a nice aroma so much so that it attracted the attention of my kitchen helper meat wellmixed casings soaking in warm water while i prep to regrind the meat mixture through a finer plate using a extrafine 30mm grinding plate for the final grind this is a slow process as the meat paste gets sticky and is a challenge sometimes to get the paste through the grinder still it is a quicker process than doing the emulsification way with a processor had enough meat to fill one large chub a little over 85lbs and limited the length so it fit my poacher and with the leftover i filled two ring casings prepping the smoker got the smoker up to 110 and hung the chubs with no smoke for the first 6090 minutes to dry i began applying smoke for the next three hours two hours in time to pull from the smoker and prep for the poacher i heated the water in the poacher to 165 and plopped the big boy into the hot bath it was soon joined by other two smaller chubs the smaller chubs reached the desired it 155 in about 30 minutes while the larger chub will continue to stay in the hot bath i pulled the smaller rings icebathed for a quick cool and let them bloom money shot of the smaller rings very tasty little crackersized rings of bologna just need some ritz crackers two hours later the big boy reaches 155 so out it comes  into an ice bath letting it bloom slicing the chub into serving slices sliced and ready to pack up or fry  eat sample time i took a batch of my uneven slices and fried em up very tasty not nearly as overlysalty or mushy as the storebought stuff pan full of bologna pacmen great way to start the new year kevin
