constantly hungry daughter email every waking minute of hannah wilkinson’s day is filled with intense hunger“even if shes just eaten we can … sit down have dinner finish i can take her plate away and shell look at me and say ‘mom im hungry’ wilkinson’s mother tonya wilkinson told abc news’ “2020”when your daughter can’t stop eating raising a child with praderwilli syndrome courtesy jenny shapiro alexis shapiro developed hypothalamic obesity after having a brain tumor removed after brain tumor removed girl is always hungry texas girl 12 who is always hungry to get gastric bypass the 14yearold’s hunger rules her family’s lives at their home in phoenix arizona the kitchen is on full lockdown with a padlock on the refrigerator no food in the cabinets and a constantly locked pantry door“when we got a dog i did not even think about dog food it didnt even cross my mind that i had to lock up the dog food” tonya wilkinson said “i have caught her  eating dog food”hannah wilkinson was born with a rare condition called praderwilli syndrome caused by a chromosomal flaw praderwilli syndrome which strikes only one in 15000 people can cause learning issues muscles weakness and a slow metabolism but the condition mostly creates an insatiable appetite which has pushed hannah wilkinson to almost 350 pounds her heaviest weight ever“the hypothalamus the part of our brain that controls our hunger with children or adults with praderwilli syndrome is pretty much shut off so they dont know that theyre not hungry” tonya wilkinson said for hannah wilkinson’s mom this means constant vigilance tonya wilkinson recalled a time when she was cleaning the kitchen after dinner and her daughter shoved a huge piece of pot roast into her mouth“i turned around and she was choking they do not chew they swallow and a lot of deaths unfortunately with praderwilli you know is the choking” said tonya wilkinson like hannah wilkinson 12yearold alexis shapiro from cibolo texas also suffers from an intense desire to eat after a surgery to remove a rare brain tumor in 2011 shapiro developed hypothalamic obesity when she was 9 years old unlike hannah wilkinson who was born with the syndrome“as soon as she woke up from surgery she immediately started asking for food” ian shapiro alexis shapiro’s father told “2020”even before she was released from the hospital alexis shapiro gained eight pounds once they got home things only got worse“she was 52 pounds at surgery and then it went up to 75 and a 100” alexis shapiro’s mother jenny shapiro told “2020” “shed wear something twice and then she would outgrow it”it turned out alexis shapiro’s surgery had altered the part of her brain that regulates appetite giving her similar symptoms to hannah wilkinson the 12yearold topped out at 203 pounds obesity experts like dr robert lustig are looking at cases like alexis shapiro’s to better understand weight gain in the rest of the population they say the key is the hypothalamus the part of the brain that when damaged releases insulin causing an insatiable appetite controlling that insulin might be a solution to fighting obesity“the same thing occurs in people without brain tumors” lustig told “2020” “when we get the insulin down they feel better they lose weight and their lives turn around so the target is not calories the target is insulin”but lustig’s work is still in the experimental phase desperate to stop alexis shapiro’s weight gain right away her parents turned to surgery“after doing lots and lots of research i found that some patients have had success with gastric bypass surgery and after the very first consultation i felt like i had hope” said jenny shapiro since the surgery alexis shapiro’s appetite has returned to normal she is more active and has lost 50 pounds for hannah wilkinson and others born with abnormal chromosomes causing praderwilli these kinds of surgeries are not an option because they do little to suppress appetites tonya wilkinson says her only hope now is to get her daughter to a specialized facility that offers around the clock monitoring and meal planning but for now even that is a fight because tonya wilkinson said she can’t get her insurance company to cover it“insurers consider it to be your own fault they consider it to be a matter of gluttony and sloth” lustig said “and praderwilli patients are the proof that that is not true so because insurers still view obesity as a behavior praderwilli sometimes gets swept under the rug”“it is a life or death issue” tonya wilkinson said and if i dont get help i will lose her”for more information on praderwilli syndrome click here or call the praderwilli syndrome association national hotline at 18009264797 comments add interests customize your news
