of you know all too well the countless hours of study and the amount of dedication required to become an effective fnp but there’s one more crucial step you must verify all you have learned by taking one of the fnp certification exams by passing a nationally recognized standardized exam that’s been developed by a team of qualified nurse practitioners and medical experts you can obtain certification as an fnp and showcase your expertise and commitment to quality care in fact the exam is now required for fnps to practice in all but three states in the united states how does certification differ from licensure sometimes licensure and certification can be confused licensure is the clearance to practice as an fnp in a specific state or states nurses and advanced practice nurses like fnps must meet licensure requirements of the state in which they live and plan to work in order to care for patients or assume any nursing role requirements for licensure will vary on a statebystate basis fnps must be able to present their state board of nursing with the appropriate proof of education clinical hours agreements with an overseeing physician if required and in some cases proof of national certification before they can see their first patient as an independent clinician the american nurses association ana says licensure is designed to “protect the public by ensuring a minimal level of professional competence”certification is one component needed for fnps to obtain licensure the ana says certification proves students have “mastered a body of knowledge and acquired skills in a particular specialty or area” in fact certification has become so important for practice that governmental health care bodies including medicare medicaid the department of veterans affairs and private insurance companies now require that fnps be certified for credentialing purposes and to receive reimbursement for the services they provide the nitty gritty of certification there are currently two credentialing bodies that offer certification examinations for fnps the american nurses credentialing center ancc and the american academy of nurse practitioners aanp offer certification for fnps plus exams for gerontology adult pediatric acute care and others each test and its requirements vary slightly most fnp certification exams require students to sit for
