thats a complicated subject unless youre on the trading desk of a powerchemicalrefinery company you probably wont find much information in addition if your company doesnt have the marginal best equipment such that you compete on efficiencyprice youll only watch from the sidelines heres a previous discussionhttpwwwwilmottcommessageviewcfmcatid3threadid54982keep in mind that some plants produce electricity by simply burning coal some by gas fired turbines with secondary heat recovery some by other means and some of those plants produce only power while others produce products power is a sideline the economics of each plant is different and those numbers change rapidly as a result pricing a plant specific heat rate versus a market heat rate can be a real humbling experience ive watched that game from the sidelines long enough to know that i dont know anything about it edit 1 some additional linkshttpnodalercotcomdocstntarcmocaheat

traded bilaterally or on an exchange where the ratio between electricity at an agreed location and natural gas at an agreed location is the strike price for an agreed quantity at an agreed expiration date this allows holder the ability to manage the the cost of the market implied heat rate for example if may henry hub is  250 mm btu and ercot south power is  2500 mwh then the market implied heat rate is 10 an option holder may want to buy a call with a strike price of 12 so they are capped from the risk of higher market implied heat rates the above whitepapers address the operational heat

first off i disagree sid jacobsons answer or at least i have never seen a contract with those settlement terms trade those terms are for a heat rate call eg final settlement c  pg  k which  pg  hr where k the strike is a heat rate so working from the example given ill change it around supposed the strike is a 10x heat rate and final settlement is 12x so to plug in c  12  10  2 two what two gases or 2x the final gas price ok that could work but ive never seen it but theres lots i probably havent seen what i have seen trade between multiple generators and banks is called a heat rate option but might more sensibly be called a spark spread option given that the above sounds like what a hr opt should be final settlement is c  p  ghr  k well max 0 both the heat rate and the strike are fixed in the contract terms strike can be zero or negative strike is typically a positive number representing the variable nonfuelnoncommodity costs associated with generation sometimes called vom i think variable operations and maintenance the call has two underlyings power and gas in theory either leg could settle either physically or financially in practice ive always seen gas settled financially and the power can be phys or fin when both are fin the holder bills the seller for the final settlement amount when the power leg is phys the holder takes delivery of power which they typically will flip with an offsetting trade and pays ghr  k for it we could imagine both legs phys where holder takes power and delivers gas but i havent seen it the two equations ive compared above can be rearranged into each other but to speak literally of contract terms i have only seen the form i give and i have seen that one many times edit also i dont think ive ever seen an exchange listing
