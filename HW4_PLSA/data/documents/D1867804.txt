the science of infidelity why women are more likely to cheat on men by eve stern june 17 2015share okay i know you might be outraged but just stay with me for a minute new research shows women may be more likely to be the culprits of infidelity than men it’s not that women are more likely to cheat than men per se but biologically and genetically we possess different features that vary our behaviors this research is colossal because ideologically we tend to assume men are the more likely culprits due evolutionary implications from a “survival of the fittest perspective” it makes slightly more sense that they would spread their seed to as many women as possible women on the other hand don’t share this evolutionary ideology and are more so on the opposite spectrum supposedly choosing most carefully a mate who we believe could provide and take care of us although this obviously isn’t always the case despite this women may be more prone to cheat instead due to their hormones and genes richard friedman lets us in on this secret in his oped “ infidelity lurks in your genes ”the key word is vasopressin women who carry a type of genetic mutation in the receptor for this hormone are more likely to engage in infidelity so maybe it’s not their fault the suggestion is carried by a recent study by a psychologist brendan p zietsch  at the university of queensland australia dr zietsch examined the link between promiscuity and the receptor genes of important hormones like vasopressin and oxytocin ever heard of oxytocin if not look it up or better yet read louann brizendine’s  the female brain  it will clue you in on exactly how our bodies and brains work for us ladies but back to oxytocin it’s like the mitochondria of our feelings or in other words it’s really goddamn powerful it’s a hormone that also acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain and essentially increases our drive to romantically pair up it’s released on many occasions but most evidently during sex vasopressin is another hormone similar in nature which has a great force on social behaviors associated with bonding like trust empathy and of course hooking up in his study dr zietsch examined the link between the wandering eye and variations in the oxytocin and vasopressin receptor genes in thousands of people who had been in a relationship for at least a year why because mutations of the vasopressin receptor could also mutate one’s own sexual behavior through the study he found 64 percent of women compared to 98 percent of men that year had two or more sexual partners the caveat is zietsch’s study discovered there was an association between five different variants of the vasopressin receptor gene which was only found in women who participated in infidelity thus we ask does this mean 40 percent of women who partake in a variation of infidelity can blame their genes for years we’ve know how oxytocin and vasopressin are associated with relationships both found in the opposite end of the infidelity pool oxytocin is the reason onenight stands for women tend to be more difficult the hormone supplies emotional bonding aka feelings so when women have sex we release loads of it annoying right this is why more often women have sex with specific partners and biologically we’ll want more than sex another study from hasse walum at the karolinska institutet institute in stockholm found that in women there is strong association between one variation of an oxytocin receptor gene and marital antagonism or lack of fondness for one’s partner similarly in men this same predicament of a lower marital discord occurs but in regard to a variation of the vasopressin receptor it is plausible though even when conducting studies in animals when looking at voles a type of rodent dr thomas r insel found vasopressin acted differently in different species while the species are both related montane voles tend to be more sexually promiscuous and prairie voles are more of the monogamous type this means montane voles are likely to leave your place before breakfast while the prairie vole try to put a ring on it when looking at the way vasopressin responded in each of these species dr insel found vasopressin receptors lit up in completely different areas of the brain which in turn caused vastly different effects on behavior for prairie voles their vasopressin receptors live close to the reward center of the brain yet the montane voles receptors are located in the amygdala which is linked to the ability to process anxiety and fear so what does this mean for women it may mean women have a higher likelihood to cheat if they possess these mutated vasopressin genes but we know this cannot be the sole cause for one we know there are tons of reasons that contribute to infidelity many of which haven’t even been scientifically measured the study does emphasize the power hormones have on our behaviors which often are misunderstood and underestimated granted i am by no means advocating everyone go out and attempt to get their genes tested but i do believe it’s important that men and women actively seek to find more about their hormones and how they affect our choices and responses in relationships at the end of the day this study will never negate the different reasons men and women engage in infidelity whether it be socially emotionally or physically
