environment green living how many watts does a normal 4 person family usei need to know an average or a little higher than average cause im buying solor panels update im useing wood heating electric stove and electric water heater and pump but 0 gas at all not even 1 drop in anything even car1 following 5 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer you can find this on your electric bill it varies widely but generally about 800 to 1500 kwh per month 1 kwh  1000 watts for 1 hour or 100 wats for 10 hrs ect 1 kwh costs about 08 to 15 depanding on the utility rates where you

should be able to give you your usage history mine gave me my history for 2 years i live in a 2000sf 2 story home with a pool for the summer months last year i was averaging about 60kwh per day i made a few changes and this summer i was averaging about 40kwh per day i put in a 374 kwdc system and im now averaging 5kwh per day it will vary by season i decided not to zero out my electric bill i got a system that maximized my rebates i may add to the system in a few years and will be able to take another rebatewhsgreenmom · 10 years ago2 0 comment it all depends are you using gas heat do you have central air conditioning etc without an electric water heater or heat pump without an electric stove without electric air conditioning most homes probably pull 3000 watts kahless · 10 years ago1 2 comment we have 4 people at home right now and we use on average 100 kwh the cost for solar panels for a regular rambler house is between 26000 and 30000 depending on your usage these  amonts calculated using 100 kwh of electricity and 177 kwh of wood just look at your electric bill it is measured in kwh 1000 watts per hour if you use 500 watts per day you will consume 1 kwh in 2 days if you use 2000 watts per day you will consume 1 kwh in 12 hours ovens and microwaves generally consume the most energy converting that energy into heat microwaves usually run between 500 and a kw but you rarely run them for more than an hour conventional ovens can consume around a kw in 10 minutes depending on how hot you need it so most of our energy is dissipating into thin air a 1 kw appliance running for 30 mins per day will take 2 days to consume 1 kw however on your bill it is different there are on average 30 days in a month or billing cycle thus 720 total billable hours if you use 100 kw 100000 watts during the month thats 100000720 or 138 kwh billed at 75 cents per kwh thats a bill of 966 or your bill may simply already be in kwh and you dont have to do any converting hopefully this is the case for the example ive used 100 kwh in one month next you need to convert the amount of energy in the wood to watts according to the second link you can expect 6050 btupound of wood following the first link we see that 1 btu  00002929 kwh thus 6050 btus  1772045 kwh per pound of wood take your monthly poundage of wood and multiply that by 177 and that will give you your monthly wattage in wood example electric bill 100 kwh used wood burned 100 pounds  177 kwh that means you use on average 277 kwh 277000 watts in one hour  38472 watts per actual hour as per your request you need a little above average so round this up to 400 watts you will need solar panels that total at least 400 watts if those panels collect at 400 watts for one hour youve just harvested 400 wh or 04 kwh most solar panels collect at 12 to 48 volts house mains run at 120 volts so 400 watt panels collecting at 12 volts that charge a battery to full in 10 hours will be completely drained at 120 volts in one hour since the 400 watts used per day is at 120 volts you will need at least 4000 watts of solar panels to run everything at the 120 volts of regular usage 12 volts of panel  10  120 effective volts httpcgiebaycomsuntechsu170monocr this is a currently running e bay auction the panel is 1080 with shipping and runs at 170 watts no volts given so im guessing its 12 volts 4000 watts  170  24 total panels needed thats 25500 in just panels you will also need cables batteries blocking diodes inverters for 120 volt current etc so lets round that up to between 26k and 30k if you consume less power than you use most electric companies will pay you for the electricity you send them expect about 5 cents per kwh so if you are planning on replacing your electric meter and wood stove s you will be looking at about 30000 of equipment i would recommend supplementing your electric usage with solar panels at whatever rate you can afford one panel every other month every 2nd month etc unless you can afford the 30k all at once for those readers who do use gas the gas bill uses decatherms 1 decatherm  10 therms 1 therm  29291 kwh thus 1 decatherm 100 therms  29291 kwh or about 3 megawatt hours
