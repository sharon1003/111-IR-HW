blue diodes the 1500foot 460 m long led display on the fremont street experience in downtown las vegas nevada is currently the largest in the world an led display is a flat panel display which uses an array of lightemitting diodes as pixels for a video display their brightness allows them to be used outdoors where they are visible in the sun store signs and billboards and in recent years they have also become commonly used in destination signs on public transport vehicles as well as variablemessage signs on highways led displays are capable of providing general illumination in addition to visual display as when used for stage lighting or other decorative as opposed to informational purposes contents  hide 1 history2 see also3 references4 external links history  editthe first true allled flat panel television screen was possibly developed demonstrated and documented by james p mitchell in 1977 initial public recognition came from the westinghouse educational foundation science talent search group a science service organization 1 the paper entry was named in the honors group publicized to universities on january 25 1978 2 the paper was subsequently invited and presented at the iowa academy of science at the university of northern iowa 3 4 the operational prototype was displayed at the eastern iowa sef 5 on march 18 and obtained a top physical sciences award and ieee recognition the project was again displayed at the 29th international sef at the anaheim ca convention center on may 8–10 6 the ¼inch thin miniature flat panel modular prototype scientific paper and full screen tiled led matrix schematic with video interface were displayed at this event 7 8 it received awards by nasa 9 and general motors corporation 10 11 12 this project marked some of the earliest progress towards the replacement of the 70 year old highvoltage analog crt system  cathoderay tube technology with a digital xy scanned led matrix driven with a ntsc television rf video format mitchells paper projected the future replacement of crts and included foreseen application to battery operated devices due the advantages of lowpower displacement of the electromagnetic scan systems included the removal of inductive deflection electron beam and color convergence circuits and has been a significant achievement the unique properties of the light emitting diode as an emissive device simplifies matrix scanning complexity and has helped the modern television adapt to digital communications and shrink into its current thin form factor the 1977 model was monochromatic by design the efficient blue led completing the color triad did not arrive for another decade large displays now use highbrightness diodes to generate a wide spectrum of colors it took three decades and organic lightemitting diodes for sony to introduce an oled tv the sony xel1 oled screen which was marketed in 2009 later at ces 2012 sony presented crystal led a tv with a true leddisplay in which leds are used to produce actual images rather than acting as backlighting for other types of display as in ledbacklit lcds which are commonly marketed as led tvs the 2011 uefa champions league final match between manchester united and barcelona was broadcast live in 3d format in gothenburg sweden on an ekta screen it had a refresh rate of 100 hz a diagonal of 711 m 23 ft 392 in and a display area of 6192×3483 m and was listed in the guinness book of records as the largest led 3d tv 13 14the 40m large led display at the armin only event in april 2008 in the jaarbeurs utrecht the led display at
