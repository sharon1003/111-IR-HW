a particular characteristicchromosome a strand of dna entwined with proteins usually found within the cells nucleushistone a protein that supports protects and helps maintain the tightly coiled structure of the dna in a chromosomechromatid one of the two dna duplicates that compose one chromosome when the chromosome is not separatedcentromere the attachment point of two sister chromatids also serves as point of attachment of spindle fibers during mitosiskaryotype an illustration in which the chromosomes of a cell are arranged according to their sizehomologous chromosomes a pair two chromosomes that have the same kinds of genes alleles in the same orderhomologue one member of a homologous pair of chromosomesdiploid having homologous pairs of chromosomeshaploid having only one member of each homologous pair of chromosomes characteristic of gametescell cycle the repeating cycle of events in the life of a cell composed of interphase mitosis and cytokinesisinterphase the period of time between cellular divisionsmitosis the duplicating and separating of a cells chromosomesprophase the first phase of mitosis centromeres migrate to poles in the cytoplasm and chromosomes develop from chromatin material in the nucleusmitotic spindle special microtubules that will direct the movements of the chromosomes during mitosismetaphase the second phase of mitosis chromosomes congregate along the equatorial plane of the cellanaphase the third phase of mitosis paired chromatids separate and begin to migrate toward opposite poles of the celltelophase the final phase of mitosis chromosomes have reached opposite poles of the cell and two distinct nuclei formcytokinesis the division of the cytoplasm in a dividing cellcell plate the precursor to the cell wall during cytokinesis in plant cellsasexual reproduction the production of a new organism without the fusion of a sperm and an ovum involves only mitotic cell divisionszygote a diploid cell formed by the union of two haploid gametesmeiosis cell division in which the chromosome number is reduced from the diploid to the haploid statetetrad a group of four joined chromatids during meiosisgamete a haploid cell which can unite with another gamete to form a zygotefertilization the process of forming a zygote the union of gametessperm a gamete formed by a male often motileovum a gamete formed by a female usually nonmotile and larger than a spermspermatogenesis the meiotic process of sperm formationoogenesis the meiotic process that forms ovasexual reproduction the union of haploid gametes that results in a diploid zygote that develops into a new individualselfpollination the process by which a plants structure allows its own pollen to provide the sperm for fertilization of ovacrosspollinate to fertilize a flower with the pollen from another flowerdominant trait the characteristic that is expressed even in the presence of the recessive genesrecessive trait the characteristic that is expressed only in the homozygous recessive conditionphenotype the physical expression of an organisms genegenotype the genetic makeup of an individual organismallele one of a pair of genes that have the same position on homologous chromosomeshomozygous having the same two alleles at the same position locus on homologous chromosomesheterozygous having two different alleles at the same position locus on homologous chromosomesmonohybrid cross a genetic cross that deals with only one set of characteristics punnett square a diagram used to visualize genetic crossespedigree a diagram that shows the characteristics of several generations of organismsincomplete dominance the type of inheritance in which the alleles for expressing characteristics are neither dominant nor recessivecodominance the expression but not blending of both alleles in a heterozygous offspringmultiple alleles the possible arrangement of three or more genes alleles for a trait at a single locusdihybrid cross a genetic cross dealing with two characteristics at the same timeindependent assortment the mendelian idea that the separation of one set of alleles during gamete formation is not affected by the separation of another set of allelespolygenic inheritance the cumulative effect of two or more genes on the same traitsex chromosome a special chromosome in humans x or y that determines whether an organism will be male or femaleautosome any chromosome other than a sex x or y chromosomesexlinked trait an inherited characteristic for which there is a gene on the x or y chromosome but not on the otherhemophilia bleeders disease a genetic disorder in which a blood chemical for blood clotting is not produced mendel augustinian monk and botanist whose experiments in breeding garden peas led to his eventual recognition as father of the science of genetics 18221884multiple gene interaction when two or more different genes each have an impact on a given trait species characteristics a trait that applies to all members of a species individual characteristics traits that make one organism unique within a group gene segregation mendels first law stating that two members of a gene pair alleles segregate separate from each other during the formation of gametes as a result onehalf the gametes carry one allele and the other half carry the other allele advertisement upgrade to remove
