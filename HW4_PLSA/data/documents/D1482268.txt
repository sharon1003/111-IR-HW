arixans alliance leveling guide  deepholm 8283submitted by arixan on mon 20101004 0517introductionnotes this guide will cover the alliance quests in deepholm i will cover 100 of the quests in the zone please note that this is based on a play through of the beta version of the zone things can and probably will change i will do my best to maintain the accuracy of the quests and objectives until finalized in the live version everything in this guide can be done solo unless i specifically state otherwise all of the level 80 zones in cataclysm make very heavy use of phasing as you progress through the zone be aware of this if you are trying to get a group for anything as they may not be in the same phase as you are you will need to be able to use a flying mount in this zone you have been warned i highly suggest you make use of the builtin quest tracking on the world map i will describe as best i can where the npcs and quest objectives are but the objective tracking on the in game map will show you precisely where to go in most cases please post and feedback errors or suggestions as comments color code quests items locations quest objectives to kill npcs coordinates table of

him login or register to post commentsbitsem go ahead if you submitted by magic sn on tue 20101123 1644 bitsem go ahead if you have any ideas to improve it as i mentioned i never have seen the content about which this is due to having no beta account i did not even check screenshots on the deepholm zone yet this is all complete dry work based on the text files arixan there are a few things i am not happy about with this one but its good enough for use can you provide details and i am pretty sure this stuff is in no way perfect there are commentshintsnotes missing there are coordinates missing etc and you probably noticed how i sneaked out of the fact that i did not know to where the end quest ports on alliance by writing to your city where it read to orgrimmar in the horde version btw did anyone start on the other missing zones for alliance does anyone have any list of coordinates for questgiversmobs for vashjir or know of a site where they could be got my method of examine and extend the horde version together with the alliance guide of arixan would not work for vashjir as the questing area is very different between alliancehorde different questgivers and all and without exact coordinates this is a problem login or register to post comments jiyambi has it right submitted by arixan on tue 20101123 1838 the comment i made was just some selfcriticism but for clarification the information in the guides is correct as far as the quest flow and information since you are working on the addon version everything you need should be there with the possible exception of some coordinates as for the other guides they will be updated as soon as i can it looks like myself and jame are going to working on polishing those up as well as finishing the rest of zones once cataclysm releases for the guides that are already complete everything should be mostly correct at least as far as the quests go i can understand why you would have some difficulty without coordinates but i will need to wait for cataclysm to fix those great job on the coding though i tried to wrap my brain around it but i guess i am just not enough of a code monkey login or register to post comments i think arixans remark was submitted by jiyambi on tue 20101123 1703 i think arixans remark was directed at his own guide not your addon version of it not sure if that was being misunderstood or not

at least submitted by arixan on mon 20101004 0549 there are a few things i am not happy about with this one but its good enough for use as always feedback is welcome if you are looking for the horde version i should have it up in a day or so but the quests flow is almost identical just the beginning and the end changes and really even then the only difference is a couple quest names and npcs enjoylogin or register to post comments wow  submitted by warbuzz on mon 20101011 1110 im impress by your guides well done arixan dont care too much about finishing all the zones in time in my opinion the most important is to have enough zone done to be able to level 85 im conviced that your three guides already done hyjal vashjir and deepholm are probably going to be enough to run quickly to 85 we are just missing the horde version of deepholm but as you mentionned the changes seems to be quick light and i dont think it will be a problems a big big thanks to you again login or register to post comments woooo glad to see you still submitted by jiyambi on mon 20101004 2022 woooo glad to see you still working on these login or register to post comments yeah still plugging away at them submitted by arixan on tue 20101005 1845 id still love to get all the 80 zones done before release but given that we only have 2 month until launch combined with the fact the real life has a pesky habit of getting in the way i am not sure i will be able to accomplish that i can certainly finish up the last two zones after release for alliance side anyway i dont have a high level horde toon on live so those will be harder to complete or much delayed either way though im gonna keep at it i started down this road and i am gonna see a complete set of cata guides even if it takes me until beta
