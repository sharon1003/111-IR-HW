possible answers to your problem i found them at httpwwwapwagnercom refrigerators typically make a lot of sounds when they operate the cause of the problem can usually be narrowed down once you determine where the sound is coming from if you hear something coming from the bottom the source is probably somewhere else there is not much under a refrigerator to make noise you may hear noise coming through this area of the fridge but it is probably originating in the back of the refrigerator regarding any water sounds refrigerators have a drip pan behind the kick plate during a defrost cycle meltwater from the freezer ice typically drains through a tube and down the back of the refrigerator into the drip pan you may hear water dripping into it or it may rattle usually evaporation empties the drip pan but you can remove it and empty it if there is a lot of liquid in it if it rattles you can check the supports holding the pan to make sure they havent been damaged you can replace the pan or you can try to secure it with tape another water flow sound would be if you have a builtin icemaker you may hear the water flowing into the if the noise is coming from the back there are a few things that could be causing the problem if the unit seems louder when the compressor starts its probably a normal sound the compressor starts with a high pressure but as the pressure balances the noise should become normalized the compressor is in a black case with no visible moving parts its located at the back of the refrigerator near the bottom and has wires and a bunch of tubes going to it if it’s humming or making a steady noise and your refrigerator is still not cooling properly there could be a problem with one or more various components if the compressor is making noise there’s probably no repairing it you’ll have to replace it this is often a very costly job and needs to be done by someone with the necessary epa certification to work on sealed systems you can usually hear air rushing or a swooshing sound from the condenser fan motor and blade if it sounds abnormal or different than usual check for dirt or dust on the blade and fan motor if this area is dirty make sure the power is off and wipe it with a clean towel if the fan blade is metal make sure that it is not hitting anything and that it is attached securely to the motor if the noise is still coming from the motor you will need to replace it the damper door opening and closing may cause a chirping or howling sound the defrost timer can also make noises it usually will make a click when it advances as the timer gets old the motor that runs the defrost timer can begin to make noises as well if the timer motor is making a loud sound then you should replace the entire timer noises related to the defrost timer are snapping crackling or popping sounds this is most likely caused by the defrost heater getting warm and cold water dripping onto it you may also hear some metallic sounding expansion or contraction creaks as the coils warm or get cool other clicking or snapping sounds may be caused by the water valve opening to fill the ice cube tray this valve is operated by a solenoid and most solenoids make a snap sound as they open and close if you notice a sound coming from the freezer youll want to check the evaporator fan motor this is the fan that circulates air through all parts of the refrigerator and freezer when the compressor is running this fan should run as well the fan blows the air over the evaporator coils to cool it as the fan gets older and worn out the moving pieces in the fan motor can start to make strange noises when you hear the noise quickly open the freezer door and manually press the door switch if the noise is louder then the motor is causing your problem the motors are not repairable you just replace the entire unit vibrating noises are often caused by dishes or other containers vibrating on a shelf inside you can move the dishes around to see if that helps other times the vibrations may be caused by something on top of the refrigerator these items could be touching and rattling around on top of the refrigerator verify that the refrigerator is not touching any nearby walls or counters source s repair center httpwwwapwagnercom jronimo · 9 years ago6 0 comment askers rating refrigerator noise source shttpsshrinksima8s igalbarado · 1 year ago0 0 comment refrigerator making noise source shttpsshorteimbbq ydeveland · 1 year ago0 0 comment yes the fan is likely hitting ice it will clear within a day after a defrost or two or as mentioned you might let it thaw but you will need to empty it first you might try cutting the power by unplugging it or at the fuse box and turning it back on on many models that triggers a defrost cycle if the thermostat is left on when you do it or if it is an electronic model then it should go through a defrost for about half an hour before coming back on thor · 9 years ago0 2 comment most of the time the ice maker heating element goes out and the arms that flip the ice out struggle hard to pop the ice loose from the freezer tray replace ice maker mary · 2 years ago0 0 commentwhile it was open so much moisture from the air got in the moisture froze up around a fan motor and it is stopped unplug it for tonight with door closed it will stay cool and let it defrost plug it back in in the morning and
