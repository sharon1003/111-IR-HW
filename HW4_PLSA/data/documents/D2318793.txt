combine sphagnum peat moss sand and cement mix you get hypertufa a material that looks like stone but weighs considerably less hypertufa works well as a material for garden planters because it is porous allowing water to drain easily while you can plant anything that requires good drainage hypertufa is especially suitable for droughttolerant plants commonly found in rock gardens such as succulents hypertufa gets its name because it closely resembles tufa rock a porous rock commonly used to make stone sinks and animal troughs for hundreds of years1break up any peat moss clumps with your hands so the mixture blends uniformly2mix 2 parts sphagnum peat moss 1 part dry cement mix and 1 part coarse sand in a large container until thoroughly blended mix in 1 part water slowly adding more water if needed until the mixture is evenly moist but not wet when squeezed in your hand you should be able to squish the mixture between your fingers without squeezing water out of the clump3line a large mold container with a plastic bag to make it easier to remove the hypertufa container when finished this container will form the shape on the outside of the hypertufa container4line the bottom of the container with an even layer of moist hypertufa mixture using a thickness of 1 to 1 12 inches for small and medium containers and up to 2 inches for large containers cut a 12inch diameter dowel pipe or similar object to the same thickness as the hypertufa layer and insert the piece in the center of mixture when the hypertufa mixture sets you can pop this piece out leaving a drainage hole5place a second mold container inside the first container placing it directly on top of the bottom layer of hypertufa mixture and centered in the container the container should be smaller than the first container by at least the same thickness as the bottom hypertufa layer but it can be smaller if desired to create thick walls in the finished container the second mold doesnt have to be the same shape you can use a round mold inside a larger square mold if desired6fill in the space between the two mold containers with moist hypertufa mixture press the mixture firmly to release air pockets you dont necessarily have to use a second container at all because the mixture should be thick enough to hold shape if you simply press it against the sides of the main mold container7wrap the filled molds in a large plastic bag and store in a cool dry location for two to three weeks to allow the mixture to harden and cure open the bag once daily and spray the hypertufa with a gentle mist of water to strengthen the hypertufa8remove the plastic bag and carefully release the hypertufa container from the mold containers pop the dowel or pipe out of the bottom to reveal the drainage hole brush the sides and round the edges with a stiff wire brush you can also use a screwdriver to carve grooves and designs in the pot return the container to the plastic bag and cure for about two more weeks spray the container daily during the curing process9fill the basin with water frequently for a period of 10 days allowing the water to drain out the hole and through the porous hypertufa to leach the alkalinity from the pot making it suitable for all plants10fill a basin larger than the hypertufa container with a solution of 1 gallon of water to 14 cup of white vinegar using as much water and vinegar as needed to cover the container leave the hypertufa pot in the vinegar mixture for about 30 minutes to neutralize the planter before filling with potting soil and plants things you will need sphagnum peat moss portland cement coarse sand large mold container plastic bags12inch dowel or pipe saw smaller mold container optionalspray bottle wire brush screwdriver white vinegar tips in addition to carving designs in the side of the container you can decorate the container with any objects of your choice after filling the mold with the mixture slide objects such as seashells or polished stones into the mixture pushing them up against the outer mold brush with a wire brush after removing the mold to remove any residual hypertufa mixture if you want to make an oversized hypertufa trough make the bottom and sides 3 to 4 inches thick and push hardware cloth in the mixture to help bind the hypertufa line the bottom of the mold with half the hypertufa mixture lay down a piece of hardware cloth and add the rest of the mixture to achieve the desired thickness stand the hardware cloth up around the sides of the mold and fill in the mold around the cloth references
