two common interpretations of this phrase one is that born of water refers to baptism this view is typically held by those who adhere to baptismal regeneration the other view which i will argue for here is that it refers to actual physical birth in this view the water might allude to amniotic fluid this view seems far more likely to me as we view the passage in its context jesus replied “very truly i tell you no one can see the kingdom of god unless they are born again”“how can someone be born when they are old” nicodemus asked “surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born”jesus answered “very truly i tell you no one can enter the kingdom of god unless they are born of water and the spirit flesh gives birth to flesh but the spirit gives birth to spirit you should not be surprised at my saying ‘you must be born again’ the wind blows wherever it pleases you hear its sound but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going so it is with everyone born of the spirit ” john 338 nivnotice that after jesus says that we must be born of water and the spirit he immediately contrasts flesh and spirit in the context jesus is answering nicodemuss concern that he must be born again in one sentence he mentions two births water and spirit and in the next sentence he again mentions two births flesh and spirit the most natural interpretation is that flesh and water are referring to the same birth in addition notice that jesus says so it is with everyone born of the spirit if he were intending to say that everyone must be born of flesh water baptism and spirit then it seems that he would have said so it is with everyone born of water and of spirit water is painted here as the already accomplished physical birthshare

concern about the viability of my interpretation and have asked a question about it here hermeneuticsstackexchangecomq1335474 – eric mar 14 12 at 1443if water  birth then why does he even mention water it seems redundant – ignatius theophorus oct 8 12 at 434i believe water refers to the amniotic fluid ignatius theophorus  its not redundant it would therefore exclude angels from salvation since they are not born of water – matt jun 11 13 at 1531i just dont think that greek ὕδωρ can refer to the amniotic fluid at all is this meaning noted at all in any lexicon or any work in greek if a physical birth were what is intended here σάρξ ‘flesh’ would be much more apropos – john peyton sep 9 13 at 1428show 5 more commentsup vote7down vote it is referring to amniotic fluid at least according to the sermons we hear in our baptist church being born of water refers to natural birth which everyone goes through and being born of the spirit refers to the gift of the holy spirit imparted at the time of salvation while this isnt explicitly stated in scripture it makes sense in context where nicodemus had just asked how he could reenter is mothers womb to be born again the idea of natural birth was clearly in the context of the current conversation and of course labor begins with the water breakingshare improve this answeredited mar 11 12 at 1748answered mar 11 12 at

– affable geek mar 11 12 at 1801which means fallen angels being not born of water cannot be saved this salvation is clearly meant for people  made in the image of god – matt jun 11 13 at 154add a commentup vote7down vote speaking of born of water and of the spirit in john 35 d a carson writesmost important of all is ezekiel 362527 where water and spirit come together so forcefully the first to signify cleansing from impurity and the second to depict the transformation of heart that will enable people to follow god wholly and it is no accident that the account of the valley of dry bones where ezekiel preaches and the spirit brings life to dry bones follows hard after ezekiel’s waterspirit passage cf ezk 37 and notes on 38 below the language is reminiscent of the ‘new heart’ expressions that revolve around the promise of the new covenant je 3129ff similar themes were sometimes picked up in later judaism eg jubilees 12325  the gospel according to john an introduction and commentary see 191196 see larger excerptjesus rebuked nicodemus because he should have been familiar with this kind of thing in the old testament on the view that water in john 35 refers to some kind of bodily fluid carson writesthere are no ancient sources that picture natural birth as ‘from water’ and the few that use ‘drops’ to stand for semen are rare and late it is true that in sources relevant to the fourth gospel water can be associated with fecundity and procreation in a general way eg song 41213 pr 51518 1 but none is tied quite so clearly to semen or to amniotic fluid as to make the connection here an obvious one the greek construction does not favour two births here moreover the entire expression ‘of water and the spirit’ cries out to be read as the equivalent of anōthen ‘from above’ if there is genuine parallelism between v 3 and v 5 and this too argues that the expression should be taken as a reference to but one birth not two for a defense of this first option cf ben witherington iii nts 35 1989 pp 155160 morris jc pp 150151share improve this answeredited mar 16 12 at 2138answered mar 16 12 at 2131aaron shaf175 3add a commentup vote1down vote kjv ephesians 526 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the wordthis verse explains what meaning jesus had in mind in his use of the term born out of water if you understand this verse romans 1017 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the wordmessage of god hebrews 116 but without faithtrust it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must

liquid but jesus himself did not baptize this way for his would be in the spirit which is of god the father this immersion had to do with past sins and not the new birth which jesus began to proclaim the promise that god had made to his people speaking of it into the mouths of his prophets ezekiel 3624 for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land ezekiel 3625 then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you ezekiel 3626 a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you an heart of flesh ezekiel 3627 and i will put my spirit within you and

not the flesh but the spirit  if this just qualifies you to see how much more the one that qualifies you to enter the kingdom of god the water is the word of god because in ephesians 526 it says that he might sanctify her the church having cleansed her by the washing of water by the word the word has the cleansing effect of water as the person meditates and act on it continually washing out your

if water in john 35 is referring to amniotic fluid then one would have to be born natural to be saved hence aborted babies miscarried children would be lost notice the text unless one is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom also the same word  water  is used later in the chapter john was baptizing in aenon near salim because there was much amniotic fluid there where does the bible the word of god ever tell you to accept christ into your heart i have heard this a lot but still unable to locate it in the bible but there is a lot i dont know luke 730 but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves not having been baptized by him i just wouldnt want to reject gods counsel but thats me ill stand before god and be judged for my actions or

word of god and the life of the word jesus is in the blood john 64758 the word jesus is described as the bread of life and to eat the bread of life means to receive him into your heart and continue in fellowship with him daily through the help of the holy spirit this is what it means to be born of water and spirit if you are not washed with the water of the word you are still in your sin and dead
