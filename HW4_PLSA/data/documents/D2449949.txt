write cd its dvd that fails like this in nero power calibration error – niklas rosencrantz jun 5 13 at 207add a comment1 answer active oldest votesup vote5down vote the pca is an area on dvds that is used by the recorder to find out how powerful the laser needs to be to successfully write to the disc its very close to the center of the disc disc writers may report medium errors if theres a physical damage or interference issue with the lens or its ability to move in addition to actual bad media try the following this might happen if the disk is upside down  its an obvious one but wouldnt hurt to check clean the drive with a cleaning disk or gently blow it with canned air make sure the drive has any firmware update installed make sure you are not putting labels or writing on the disc before burning it ensure sata cables connecting drive to motherboard are secure if this is a desktop remove any cd or dvd burning software such as nero and try again try burning from a linux live cd in the very remote chance its an operating systemsoftware issue beyond that if you try a different brand of dvdr and get the same results replace the driveshare improve this answeranswered apr
