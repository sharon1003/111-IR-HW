antibiotics for chlamydia  levofloxacin levofloxacin is a synthetic chemotherapeutic antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone drug class and is used to treat severe or lifethreatening bacterial infections or bacterial infections that have failed to respond to other antibiotic classes it is sold under various brand names such as levaquin and tavanic the most common in form of ophthalmic solutions it is known as oftaquix quixinand iquix levofloxacin is a chiral fluorinated carboxyquinolone investigation of ofloxacin an older drug that is the racemic mixture found that the l form the â€“ s enantiomer is more active this specific component is levofloxacin levofloxacin interacts with a number of other drugs as well as a number of herbal and natural supplements such interactions increase the risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias anticoagulation the formation of nonabsorbable complexes as well as increasing the risk of toxicity levofloxacin is associated with a number of serious and lifethreatening adverse reactions as well as spontaneous tendon ruptures and irreversible peripheral neuropathy such reactions may manifest long after therapy had been completed and in severe cases may result in lifelong disabilities hepatoxicity has also been reported with the use of levofloxacin as of 2011 the u s food and drug administration fda has added two black box warnings for this drug in reference to spontaneous tendon ruptures and the fact that levofloxacin may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms including muscle weakness and breathing problems such an adverse reaction is a potentially lifethreatening event and may require ventilatory support levofloxacin is used to treat a number of infections including respiratory tract infections cellulitis urinary tract

inhalational anthrax postexposure added 552008 note levofloxacin has shown moderate activity against anaerobes and is about twice as potent as ofloxacin against mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria including mycobacterium avium complex oral and i v levaquin are not licensed by the fda for use in children other than the exception inhalational anthrax due to the risk of reversible or irreversible injury to the musculoskeletal system although claimed to be effective levofloxacin is not to be considered a first line agent for inhalational anthrax in the pediatric population due to severe adverse reactions involving the musculoskeletal system and other serious adverse reactions including fatalities the cdc revoked its recommendation regarding the use of fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin as a firstline agent in treating anthrax in part due to the risk of adverse reactions documented within the antimicrobial postexposure prophylaxis for anthrax study aka cipro 60day study however the fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the uk note levofloxacin may be licensed for other uses or restricted by the various regulatory agencies worldwide levofloxacin should be administered only as described within the dosage guidelines table found within the most current package insert the status of the patients renal function and hepatic function must also be taken into consideration to avoid an accumulation that may lead to a fatal drug overdose levofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion however the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the liver and the intestine modification of the dosage is recommended using the table found within the package insert for those with impaired liver or kidney function particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction within the package insert it is stated since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function the duration of treatment depends upon the severity of infection in the range of 3 days to 60 days note the patients serum levels should be monitored during therapy to avoid a drug overdose see the most current package insert for proper dosing guidelines and relevant warningsprecautions time 20120329
