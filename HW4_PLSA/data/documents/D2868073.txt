gould and james fisk who attempted to corner the gold market in early september they bought as much bullion as they could get their hands on causing the price of gold to skyrocket they also enlisted the help of abel corbin the brotherinlaw of president ulysses s grant they wanted him to convince the president to limit the metals availability which would drive its price even higher but their attempt to use the white house to manipulate the supply failed when grant learned what was happening he ordered the u s treasury to sell gold instead the government unloaded 4 million worth and on
