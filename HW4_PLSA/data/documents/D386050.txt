oculomotor nerve cn iiigo to academy store learn more and purchase the nucleus of cn iii is located dorsally within the midbrain beneath the aqueduct connecting the third and fourth ventricles see fig 135  the nuclear complex itself represents a collection of subnuclei that have specific identifiable functions most dorsally the central caudal nucleus is a midline structure that innervates both levator palpebrae muscles rostrally the edingerwestphal ew nucleus is a paired structure that sends parasympathetic signals to the sphincter muscles of the pupil and the muscles of accommodation in the ciliary body the medial complex which lies most ventrally has been shown to contain 3 subnuclei that play variable roles in medial rectus function one of these subsets may receive input from the mesencephalic reticular formation firing in response to retinal temporal disparity that indicates a near target additional connections include pathways that tie the nrtp to the cerebellar vermis and the flocculus and fastigial nucleus the inferior rectus subnucleus lies dorsally and rostrally the inferior oblique subnucleus is located laterally between the inferior rectus subnucleus and the ventral medial rectus subnucleus the fibers exit ventrally along with the fibers destined to innervate the medial rectus inferior rectus and the pupil and ciliary body fibers from the superior rectus subnucleus which lies along the midline cross before exiting ventrally to travel along with the fibers destined for the levator recall that cn iv also crosses to innervate the contralateral superior oblique muscle within the midbrain cn iii is topographically organized into a superior division supplying the superior rectus and levator and an inferior division supplying the medial and inferior rectus inferior oblique and pupillary sphincter and ciliary body but the true anatomical division into 2 branches occurs at the level of the anterior cavernous sinussuperior orbital fissure the fascicles of cn iii traverse the ventral midbrain tegmentum passing near and possibly through the red nucleus the substantia nigra and the corticospinal tracts within the cerebral peduncle multiple fascicles totaling approximately 15000 fibers exit on the ventral surface of the peduncles although seen as 1 structure within the subarachnoid space—as is the case in the midbrain—the nerve and its various fibers are topographically organized within the subarachnoid space the nerve passes between the superior cerebellar artery below and the posterior cerebral artery above and receives its blood supply from branches off the proximal posterior cerebral artery and superior cerebellar artery and tentorial branches from the meningohypophyseal trunk the nerve runs slightly oblique to the tentorial edge parallel and lateral to the posterior communicating artery the pupillary fibers are usually found on the dorsomedial surface of the nerve where they are anatomically vulnerable to compression the uncus which is the most medial aspect of the temporal lobe is located just above the tentorium and the subarachnoid third nerve unilateral supratentorial mass lesions may force the uncus through the tentorial notch uncal herniation to compress the ipsilateral cn iii at the back edge of the dura of the clivus and cavernous sinus the nerve enters its own dural canal just above cn iv running forward in the superior lateral wall of the cavernous sinus the nerve separates into a superior and an inferior division these divisions enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure within the annulus of zinn the superior division runs forward intraconally to innervate first the superior rectus and then the levator above on its inferior surface the inferior division sends parasympathetic fibers to the ciliary ganglion in the orbital apex approximately 10 mm anterior to the annulus of zinn and lateral to the optic nerve within the ciliary ganglion the fibers destined for the pupillary sphincter and the ciliary body synapse the fibers subsequently accompany the branch destined for the inferior oblique muscle there are approximately 9–10 times as many fibers associated with accommodation innervating the ciliary body as there are fibers reaching the pupillary sphincter muscle this disparity is possibly one of the reasons for the development of light–near dissociation in adie tonic pupil see chapter 10 bhatti mt eisenschenk s roper sn guy jr superior divisional third cranial nerve paresis clinical and anatomical observations of 2 unique cases arch neurol 2006 63 5 771 –776 leigh rj zee ds the neurology of eye movements 4th ed new york oxford university press 2006 rhoton ai natori y the orbit and sellar region microsurgical anatomy and operative approaches new york thieme 1996
