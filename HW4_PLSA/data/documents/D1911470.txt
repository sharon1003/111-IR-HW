1superfamilies cercopithecoidea old world monkeys hominoidea apescatarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians the other being the plathyrrhine  new world monkeys  the catarrhini contains the old world monkeys and the apes the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes consisting of the orangutans gorillas chimpanzees and humans the catarrhine are all native to africa and asia members of this parvorder are called catarrhines contents  hide 1 description2 classification and evolution21 cladogram3 references description  editthe technical distinction between the new world platyrrhines and old world catarrhines is the shape of their noses the platyrrhines from ancient greek platu flat and rhin nose have nostrils which face sideways the catarrhines from ancient greek kata down and rhin nose have nostrils that face downwards catarrhines also never have prehensile tails and have flat fingernails and toenails a tubular ectotympanic ear bone and eight not 12 premolars giving them a dental formula of 21232123 2most catarrhine species show considerable sexual dimorphism and do not form a pair bond most but not all species live in social groups  citation needed like the platyrrhines the catarrhines are generally diurnal 2 and have grasping hands and with the exception of bipedal humans grasping feet the apes – in both traditional and phylogenic nomenclature – are exclusively catarrhine species in traditional usage ape describes any tailless larger and more typically grounddwelling species of catarrhine ape may be found as part of the common name of such species such as the barbary ape in phylogenic usage the term ape applies only to the superfamily hominoidea this grouping comprises the two families hylobatidae the lesser apes or gibbons and hominidae the great apes including orangutans gorillas chimpanzees homo and related extinct genera such as the prehuman australopithecines and the giant orangutan relative gigantopithecus classification and evolution  editaccording to schrago  russo apes and old world monkeys split from their new world monkey kin about 35 million years ago mya they use the major catarrhine division between cercopithecoids and hominoids of about 25 mya which they argue is strongly supported by the fossil evidence as a calibration point and from this also calculate the gibbons separating from the great apes including humans about 1519 mya 3according to begun and harrison apes and old world monkeys split from their new world monkey kin about 44  40 mya with the first catarrhines appearing in africa and arabia and not appearing in eurasia outside arabia until 1817 mya 4the distinction between apes and monkeys is complicated by the traditional paraphyly of monkeys apes emerged as a sister group of old world monkeys in the catarrhines which are a sister group of new world monkeys therefore cladistically apes catarrhines and related contemporary extinct groups such as parapithecidaea are monkeys as well for any consistent definition of monkey old world monkey may also legitimately be taken to be meant to include all the catarrhines including apes and extinct species such as aegyptopithecus 5 in which case the apes cercopithecoidea and aegyptopithecus emerged within the old world monkeys order primates 1suborder
