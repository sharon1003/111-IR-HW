digital forensic insider the digital forensic subdisciplines part 2mon 02012010  300am comments by john j barbara the confusion concerning the digital and multimedia evidence subdisciplines suggests the discipline should be revised in the controlled substances discipline the analysis of plant material solid dosage material pills and capsules liquid from syringes and general unknowns are routine tasks however these tasks involve analyzing different types of samples which require different training for the examiners the use of different instrumentation and equipment and different analytical practices deeper insights advances in forensic analyses when to use gcmsms lcmsms and hrmsfor instance when a syringe containing a liquid is submitted for analysis the examiner will take universal precautions in handling the syringe remove the liquid perform an acidbase extraction into an organic solvent evaporate the organic solvent to a small volume and inject an aliquot into a gas chromatographmass spectrometer once the mass spectrum s of the substance s contained in the syringe have been determined the examiner can search a library of compounds to identify the substance s if we were to use the current digital and multimedia evidence discipline as the example controlled substances would be expected to have several subdisciplines such as “plant material” “solid dosage” “liquid analysis” or “general unknowns” to account for the diversity of sample types submitted for analysis the ascldlab accreditation program does not list any subdisciplines under its controlled substances discipline rightly so since the examination process involves searching for and identifying the presenceabsence of controlled substances regardless of the sample type s although different analytical practices procedures and instruments are utilized the examiner’s training program is all inclusive the key element is that the examiner is trained how to appropriately handle the different samples how to prepare them for analysis and how to use the different instruments and equipment to obtain results in many instances what occurs in the controlled substances discipline is analogous to practices in the digital and multimedia evidence discipline in the previous column an example examination involving computer hard drives was discussed the video examiner forensically 1 copied hashed and examined the hard drives computer forensics 2 extracted and analyzed the digital video files video analysis 3 analyzed the digital audio tracks audio analysis and 4 compared images from the video files to images of the weapon and to the suspects on the digital photographs image analysis an analogy to the controlled substances discipline was that the video examiner received specific training to conduct the analysis in all four areas the analysis was conducted on digital media using specialized instrumentation and equipment all of which was computer controlled available software and hardware allows an examiner to analyze digital video files enhance both the video and audio and to capture any potential probative images once this has been done the examiner can easily review the images and render determinations and opinions readdressing the discipline ascldlab has been accrediting the digital and multimedia evidence discipline since 2003 up to that time there was no body of information or expertise within ascld or ascldlab pertaining to the nuances of digital media and how the discipline should be defined for accreditation purposes appropriately at that time ascld and ascldlab accepted and adopted the recommendations of swgde for the discipline name and the four subdisciplines however what seemed appropriate in 2003 may no longer be appropriate in 2010 a considerable number of inspections and assessments have been conducted in the digital and multimedia evidence discipline since 2003 and with each one further knowledge and experience is gained by ascldlab and its assessors in the late 1990s the primary digital items being analyzed by laboratories were computers and hard drives thus the moniker computer forensics encapsulated the type of analysis being performed this is no longer the case and “computer forensics” is itself a misnomer that does not represent the extent of the analyses being performed under its name today all types of digital media such as cellular telephones digital cameras secure digital cards and so forth are analyzed not just computers as the name implies similarly one of the first steps in analyzing analog media is to generally convert it to a digital format the important point is that all the data being analyzed is digital regardless of the media onin which it resides over the past six years the evolvement of accreditation in the digital and multimedia evidence discipline has reached a new level of understanding currently at the state and local level many forensic laboratories offer services in computer forensics but very few offer services in forensic audio image analysis or video analysis in retrospect the current implementation of the discipline and its four subdisciplines is and continues to be problematic in determining where one subdiscipline ends and another one begins they continually seem to overlap one another although it may not be perceived as a popular decision it seems readily apparent that ascld and ascldlab should reexamine its original acceptance of the discipline as it currently exists and consider a revision what’s been done elsewhere in november 2008 the national association of testing authorities nata in australia added a new class of test to its forensic science accreditation program for those not familiar with nata  httpwwwnataasnaugoaboutnata  its role is somewhat analogous to that of ascldlab’s offering laboratory accreditation in forensic science and in many other areas nata plays a key role in australia’s standards and conformance infrastructure which provides an important mechanism for improving the business efficiency and competitiveness of australian industry in international and national markets within this infrastructure nata acts asthe

reference materialsa peak authority for the accreditation of inspection bodies nata represents australia inthe international laboratory accreditation cooperation ilacthe asia pacific laboratory accreditation cooperation aplacthe oecd working group on good laboratory practice the new class of test discipline in our terms that was added by nata was called “electronic evidence” analogous to the digital and multimedia evidence discipline however rather than adding four subdisciplines nata included just two “data preservation” and “data analysis” although this could be one way to address a revision of the digital and multimedia evidence discipline there is another since indeed all analysis is performed on digital or digitized media dropping the four subdisciplines and renaming the discipline “digital forensics” would bring the discipline in line with current practices and terminology and maintain consistency within the accreditation program itself this is the logical progression from where we were several years ago to today summary the key element in revising the digital and multimedia evidence discipline concerns the training of the examiners as long as the examiners are trained to handle the different sample types and instruments and demonstrate competency and proficiency the controlled substances discipline does not need subdisciplines likewise as long as an examiner is trained to perform the examinations in hisher training program and is competency and proficiency tested there is no need to continue to have four subdisciplines in the digital and multimedia evidence discipline currently there are two external providers for proficiency tests in computer forensics as of this writing there has not been any vendor interested in becoming an external proficiency test provider for forensic audio or image analysis the lack thereof is problematic and presents a potential quality assurance challenge with no external provider in these two subdisciplines a laboratory has to refer to another laboratory to provide a sample or to develop one consistent with the requirements of their proficiency testing program a recent vendor has emerged for video analysis and they are under consideration this potential flaw in the quality assurance system of a laboratory performing analysis in these current subdisciplines is obviated if the subdisciplines no longer existed in retrospect although very well intentioned at the time the original recommendation of the discipline name and its four subdisciplines needs to be readdressed the digital and multimedia evidence discipline should be renamed “digital forensics” and the current four subdisciplines eliminated this would make it consistent with the existing accredited discipline of controlled substances if that does not occur then possibly ascld and ascldlab should consider expanding controlled substances to encompass subdisciplines and make it consistent with the digital and
