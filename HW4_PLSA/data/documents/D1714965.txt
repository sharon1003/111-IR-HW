poetic techniques  terminology by evelynoconnor on april 17 2011 · 164 comments what they mean and how they work rather than alphabetical the following list is organised from simple basic terms  techniques that you must be able to identify and discuss to more complex ones of which a passing knowledge is sufficient theme  the message of the poem the point the author wishes to makeeg in “september 1913” yeats points out that ireland has become a greedy soulless country  laments that the sacrifices our ancestors made in pursuit of irish freedom have been forgotten topic  what the poem is about the ‘subject matter’eg the topicsubject matter of “i wake and feel the fell of dark” by hopkins is depression sometimes the subject matter of a poem is revealed in the title “child” “spring” or alluded to “mirror” deals with the topic of vanity  identity tone  the attitude of the writer towards his subject mattereg yeats’ tone is bitter and resentful in “september 1913” hopkins tone is awestruck and accusatory in “god’s grandeur” plath’s is both celebratory and cautious in “morning song” the tone can vary many tones can be contained within a single poem mood  feelings expressed includes what the writerspeaker feels and how the reader feels when they read the poem may also be related to the atmosphere createdeg in “felix randal” the mood varies from relief to sympathy to impatience to acceptance to comfort to admiration and ends with a triumphant and fiercely energetic mood in the space of 14 linesnote tone  mood are closely related the tone of voice used will often influence the moodatmosphere yeats’ uses a sarcastic tone to reveal his anger and frustration when he says “for men were born to pray and save” in “september 1913” how does a writer create a mood largely through their choice of words colour – white suggests purity  cleanliness red – passion  sometimes bloodviolence black – darkness  despair green can suggest envy or naturenew growth yellow – sunshine or sickness jaundice purple – royalty or bruises grey – depression or poverty brown – dirt  decay orange – glow  happiness obviously the context in which the colours appear will influence your interpretation of their meaning “her yellow face moaned  writhed” suggests illness pain “yellow rays played upon her face” suggests sunshine energy positive or negative adjectives – tremendous delirious fabulous heavenly v’s heavy ugly rusty terrible horrific positive or negative verbs – to shine to gather to spring to capture to sooth to comfort to light to brood to bloom to fill to meditate to sing to skip to brighten to build v’s to flicker to seep to swarm to wring to fumble to shiver to weigh to scatter to thread to fight to moan to cry to ooze to mock to break rhythm  sound effects – a fast rhythm can suggest excitement danger or anger depending on the poem a poet creates a fast rhythm by a using lots of short words monosyllabic  single syllable b using words which contain the narrow vowel sounds ‘e’  ‘i’ and c repeating guttural  g ‘guh’  greed r ‘ruh’  riot harsh  h ‘hah’  hate ck ‘ kuh’  cry or explosive consonants  b ‘buh’  bite p ‘puh’  pinch eg “there’s a dance i n b i lly b r e nnan’s b arn ton i ght” eg “why do m e n th e n now not r e ck h i s r od a slow rhythm can suggest relaxation sadness or disappointment depending on the poem a poet creates a slow rhythm by a using lots of long words b using words which contain the broad vowel sounds ‘o’ ‘a’  ‘ee’ and c repeating soft consonants  s ‘ss’  soft l ‘el’  lovely eg “when w ee d s in wh ee l s s h oo t l o ng and l o vely and l u s h” eg “i hear l a ke water l a pping with l o w s o und s by the s h o re”  imagery  the picture the writer creates using words eg “in me she has drowned a young girl and in me an old woman  rises toward her day after day like a terrible fish” plath “mirror” “and all is seared with trade bleared smeared with toil  and wears man’s smudge and shares man’s smell” hopkins “god’s grandeur” “coming with vivid faces  from counter or desk among grey  eighteenthcentury houses” yeats’ “easter 1916”how do you write about imagery in order to discuss imagery you must be willing to comment on the writers choice of words what does a word suggest to you and to describe the picture that is created in your mind by the phraseimage in other words your imagination must be active and at work as you are readingeg plath creates a clear picture of childhood when she says“i want to fill it with colour and ducks  the zoo of the new” immediately the reader is reminded of bright primary colours rubber duckies from bathtime and thrilling trips to the zoo to see exotic animals for the first time you may also want to comment on the feelings that this image creates in you from the example above my answer might continue…the emphasis on innocence everything is “new” and abundance when plath uses the verb “fill” creates a very optimistic and joyous mood the use of the word “colour” completes our sense that this is a bright and carefree celebration of the child’s potential to experience everything positive the world has to offer finally the poet’s desire to provide this for her child comes across when she says very simply “i want notice that of the 14 words in the quote i have commented on 7 of them i describe the picture the image created in my mind i comment on the atmosphere innocence  abundance and the mood optimistic joyous the words create i identify both verbs in the sentence ‘fill’  ‘want’ and the feelings they suggest finally i link this image to the theme of the poem the overall point plath makes – that she wants her child to ‘experience everything positive the world has to offer’ imagery  the senses…we experience the world through the five senses – taste touch sight smell and sound if a writer wishes us to feel that we are there beside him in the experience he must give us details of smells sounds and textures as well as describing what he can see look at the following example“the buzz saw snarled and rattled in the yard and made dust and dropped stovelength sticks of wood”we can hear the sound of the saw because the poet uses the onomatopoeic words ‘buzz’ ‘snarl’  ‘rattle’ we can see the exact size of the logs they are cutting because the poet includes the detail ‘stovelength sticks’ we can almost taste and smell the dust in the air images can be visual – we can see them images can be auditory – we can hear them images can be tactile– we can touch them images can be olfactory – we can smell them images can be sensuous – we can feeltaste their texture handy phrases the image is particularly striking  unusual  eyecatching because……the writer offers a vivid image of ………… the poets choice of verbs ‘rush’  ‘charge’ adds energy  movement the description is particularly remarkable because ………… the poem is full of bright colourful imagery the poet uses the words… the poem is full of dark haunting images of death and destruction… the auditory images in the poem are particularly loud due to the poets use of onomatopoeia in the line “the buzz saw snarled and rattled”the image is very sensuous in its description of “silken velvet thighs” the imagery of spring creates a sense of possibility of new beginnings the imagery of winter suggests that the end is nigh  that life is difficult the image of the scarecrow suggests poverty  frailty a pitiful creature the image of the holy ghost as a mother hen protecting her nest is extremely comforting it also offers us an interesting perspective on how small and insignificant man is when compared to god tricks with language repetition  repeating a word or phrase to emphasise its importance create a regular rhythmeg “romantic ireland’s dead and gone it’s with o’leary in the grave”the poet repeats the most important point over and over the line remains lodged in our brains long after we have finished reading like the chorus of a song the repetition of this line at the end of every verse makes the poem resemble a ballad and creates a strong rhythm this repetition also emphasises the poets certainty effect emphasis certainty rhythm idea becomes memorable lodges in the brain personification  describing an objectidea as though it were alive giving it human qualitieseg “i am silver and exact i have no preconceptions  whatever i see i swallow immediately”plath uses personification in the poem “mirror” what is the effect the relationship between the poet and the object comes to life the sense that one can be devoured by vanity is contained in the word “swallow” and the mirror is likened to a bottomless pit effect objectplaceidea which is personified becomes a ‘character’ and the poet’s relationship with this objectplaceidea takes centre stage object can appear in a positive friendly bright comforting or a negative destructive cruel ferocious light depending on the description idea of objects coming to life can be frightening personification can help us to look at an objectplaceidea in a new light see roddy doyle’s brilliant use of personification in the short story ‘brilliant’contrast  placing 2 very different things side by sideeg “like a trapped bird she hid behind her hair  confident buxom girls crowded the corridors”the girl’s isolation seems emphasised when it is contrasted with the friendship these crowds of girls enjoy her shyness contrasts with their confidence thus the poet uses contrast to emphasise that this girl is an outsider and doesn’t fit ineg “the world is charged with the grandeur of god  ……generations have trod have trod have trod and all is seared with trade bleared smeared with toil…”much of hopkins’ poetry makes use of contrast the beauty of god’s creation and man’s destructive disregard for nature are placed side by side the effect of using this technique is that man’s sins seem even more heinous and nature’s power to renew itself seems even more admirable effect a allows writer to emphasise differences between two things b highlight the unique characteristics of each symbolism  a word becomes a sign of something other than simply itselfeg the heart is an organ that pumps blood around the body but it is also a symbol of love the scorpion is an insect but it can also be a symbol of poisonous evil a mirror is an object that reflects peoples appearances but it can also be a symbol of vanity a lion is a dangerous animal but it can also be a symbol of courageeg in “september 1913” john o’leary is a real person who yeats was friendly with and who fought for irish freedom but he also becomes a symbol of bravery selfsacrifice and devotion to your country effect this is a powerful device because it encourages the reader to read deeper layers of meaning into the poem it also allows the poet to evoke an idea vanity without naming it directly writers consider this important because they don’t like stating the obvious or saying things in an overly direct and childlike way simile  where the writer compares 2 things using the words ‘like’ or ‘as’eg plath says of her bees “it is the noise that appals me most of all  the unintelligible syllables  it is like a roman mob ”often the writer will compare two things that on the surface are very different – at first we think that a box full of bees is nothing like a mob of poor people from ancient rome however both are dangerous when upset both find strength in numbers both can create a buzz of anger and unease and both feel mistreated by those with power over them when discussing a simile first state which two things are being compared next explain the linksimilarities between them a good simile helps us to understand something more clearly eg the bees by comparing it to something else the mob writers try to avoid similes that are used in everyday speech however as they lack originality and have become clichéd – for example “as black as coal” “sweet like chocolate” “run like the wind” “as strong as an ox” effect helps the reader to form a vivid picture reader can quickly understand what an object is like by linking it in their minds to something else metaphor  where two things are said to be the sameeg seamus heaney in “bogland” declares “the ground itself is kind black butter” obviously the bog is not made of butter but by saying that that the ground is butter instead of saying the ground is like butter the comparison becomes more direct forceful and certain in other words many writers prefer metaphors to similes because they think they are more powerfulother examples which should help you to clarify the difference between metaphors and similes eg “a blanket of mist” instead of “mist like a blanket” eg “the eyes are the mirror of the soul” instead of “the eyes are like a mirror” eg “the yellow smoke…licked it’s tongue into the corners of the evening” instead of “the yellow smoke was like a tongue” effect helps the reader to form a vivid picture reader can quickly understand what an object is like by linking it in their minds to something else note similesmetaphors make a poet’s imagery more vivid  effective allusion  where the writer makes reference to ‘ wellknown ’ figures or events from literature history or mythologyeg in “easter 1916” yeats makes reference to padraic pearse “this man had kept a school  and rode our winged horse” in “spring”hopkinsrefers to the biblical story of adam  eve’s fall from grace and the subsequent infection of the world with sin “a strain of the earth’s sweet being in the beginning in eden garden…”effect the writer gives the impression that he is very educated and knowledgeable and as a result the reader is more likely to respect his opinion and believe that he has something important to say by connecting his work to previous important events and famous works of literature the writer indirectly suggests that his work belongs on a par with them the meaning of the poem also gains a greater depth and significance through reference to similar historicalliterary eventsfigures if the reader is unfamiliar with the reference this can rouse hisher curiosity however if a writer uses allusion too often or refers to obscure or difficult sources the reader can become confused  frustrated and begin to feel stupid because they don’t ‘get’ it note lots of television programmes now make extensive use of allusion “the simpsons” frequently makes reference to wellknown celebrities historical figures  historical events “killnaskully” recently based an entire episode on the story of the john b keane play “the field” if you ‘get’ the reference the episode or poem becomes funnier or more meaningful if you don’t it can be hard to make sense of it and thus excessive use of allusion can be frustrating for the reader – but you can always find out what it means and then the poem has another layer mof meaning for you to access hyperbole  the deliberate use of exaggerationeg wordsworth in the poem “the daffodils” says “ten thousand saw i at a glance” in order to emphasise their sheer number and create drama for the reader hyperbole can also add humour – “he had an arse like an elephant and a personality to match” or emphasise the strength of a person’s feelings – “football isn’t just a matter of life and death it’s more important than that” however if used too often it loses its effect effect adds drama humour andor emphasis ambiguity  where wordssentences have more than one meaning are open to numerous interpretationseg kavanagh in the poem “inniskeen rd…” says “a road a mile of kingdom i am king  of banks and stones and every blooming thing”in this example the word “blooming” creates the ambiguity because the word can mean ‘to grow’ – so he is king of every growing thing in nature or the word “blooming” can be a curse – so he is king of every bloody thing this makes it difficult for the reader to decide if he is happy or upset poets often make their poetry ambiguous open to various interpretations deliberately in this example kavanagh was happy to be left alone on the road because it inspired him – what ‘bloomed’ or grew from the experience was this poem yet he was also sad that he didn’t fit in that he was always alone – and that is why he curses thus the writer uses ambiguity to explain to us that he felt two waysabout this experience – both happy and sad effect poems can mean different things to different people writers use ambiguity to point out that our feelings our experiences and our words are not always simple and straightforward – sometimes they mean more than one thing to us writers can express the complexity of their feelings or ideas by deliberately creating an ambiguous statement for example yeats’ attitude towards the 1916 rising “a terrible beauty is born” the violence  bloodshed is terrible but the rebels’ devotion to irish freedom and their willingness to fight for what they believe in is beautiful rhetorical q  a q that doesn’t require a response a statement disguised as a questioneg yeats asks “was it for this the wild geese spread… for this that all that blood was shed” but the unspoken implied answer is emphatically no usually the tone of rhetorical questions is one of outrage and disbelief “are we barbaric enough to bring back capital punishment”effect by asking a rhetorical question and suggesting that the answer is so obvious that noone need even answer the writer implies that anyone who disagrees with him is a fool sound effectsalliteration  the repetition of the same letter at the beginning of a series of words eg “billy brennan’s barn”effect depends on the letter – see above our eye is drawn to the repetition of the same letter and our ear perks up when we hear the same sound repeated used for emphasis and for the musical effect it creates onomatopoeia  words whose sound imitates their meaning eg “buzz tinkle rattle stutter whisper bang”effect the reader can hear what is being described auditory images those which appeal to our sense of hearing bring a description to life assonance  the repetition of similar vowel sounds effect alters speedrhythm of the line see above fastslow rhythm tagged with
