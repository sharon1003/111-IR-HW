this template once done ezio and the trefoil glyph glyphs were data entry points scattered around the virtual representation of renaissance italy rendered by the animus  desmond miles was able to locate several of them while reliving the memories of his ancestor ezio auditore da firenze each glyph revealed historical details about the conflict between the assassins and the templars humanity and pieces of eden  contents  showorigins ezio activating one of the glyphs the glyphs were created by clay kaczmarek desmonds predecessor in the animus project clay had discovered  the truth  during the prolonged animus sessions but he could not share this information during his captivity instead he hacked the animus and hid a video file in a number of encrypted data fragments in form of glyphs on certain structures 1in an effort to inform the next animus subject of the hack clay left a number of cryptic images drawn in his own blood scattered across the animus project laboratory as a clue to look for such symbols in the environments rendered by the animus 1abstergo laboratory clays messages on the bedroom wall before desmond miles was placed in the animus abstergo had cleaned away clays blood messages 2these messages were impossible to see with the naked eye however through the bleeding effect desmond eventually gained the ability of eagle vision which allowed him to perceive clays blood writing although he was able to see it desmond could not comprehend its meaning at the time of his captivity 3in the animus 20during the escape from abstergo facility lucy stillman took the animus memory core unaware that it contained the data which clay tampered with when the core was transferred to the animus 20 the glyph data was transferred along with it 1rebecca holding the memory core with the glyph data while reliving the memories of ezio auditore da firenze desmond and his fellow assassins discovered the existence of the glyphs and guessed how they appeared in the animus 20 eventually concluding the data was tampered with by clay and came with the abstergo memory core 1desmond found numerous symbols scattered across various landmarks which contained the encrypted file fragments clay placed a safeguard the files however as each glyph had to be scanned with eagle vision to access it and the files were only compatible with the animus itself 1desmond solved the puzzles contained within each glyph allowing him to access a short clip of the truth video once all the glyphs were solved these short clips combined to form a complete footage from one of clays classified session at abstergo depicting adam and eve running through eden with a stolen apple of eden 1the puzzles revealed some of the activities of the assassins and templars and instances where pieces of eden had emerged across the human history 1rome ezio locating a rift when shaun hastings analyzed the results of the glyph puzzles he discovered the puzzles also contained coordinates to additional certain locations within the animus these led desmond to a series of cluster puzzles accessible through the rifts in programming in the city of rome 4these rifts were also safeguarded as they did not physically appear on the landmarks at all unless seen with the eagle vision another notable difference was that ezio had to physically enter a rift rather than just scan it 4after solving all ten of the rift puzzles a video message the miracle is in the execution appeared though the assassins figured it was not a video at all but rather an encrypted file rebecca managed to make it accessible to desmond the file contained a course similar to the animus virtual training program at the end desmond was presented with a digital image of clay kaczmarek which spoke to him about eve the sun eden and the darkness before disappearing 4glyph locations each glyph was located on a historical landmark within the animus after approaching a landmark with a glyph on it the landmarks
