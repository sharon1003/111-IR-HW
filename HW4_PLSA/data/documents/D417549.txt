trials including a total of 50 patients were identified which fulfilled the review inclusion criteria both of these found a beneficial effect of intratympanic gentamicin therapy for ménières disease although the size of the effect differed between the two trials based on these findings we conclude that intratympanic gentamicin may be an effective treatment for vertigo complaints in ménières disease but it carries a risk of increasing hearing loss further research is needed to clarify the effect of intratympanic gentamicin on vertigo in ménières disease and the risk of inducing or

commonly used as treatment in such infants certain antibiotic regimens could lead to drug side effects and even antibiotic resistance the authors of this study reviewed the medical literature to ascertain the best antibiotic combination for the treatment of this condition four eligible studies were identified and only two of these studies were found to be suitable for analysis both these studies were performed before 1988 the two studies included 62 infants with nec and compared one antibiotic regimen to another there was no difference between the two groups the authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend a particular antibiotic regimen for nec see all 90summaries for consumers intratympanic gentamicin for ménières disease or syndrome ménières disease is
