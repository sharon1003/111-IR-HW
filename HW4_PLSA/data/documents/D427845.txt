from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from assured clear distance aheadnavigation search the assured clear distance ahead  acda is the distance ahead of any terrestrial locomotive device such as a land vehicle 1 2 3 watercraft 4 5 6 skates or skis 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 although commonly an automobile which can be seen to be clear of hazards by the driver within which they should be able to bring the device to a halt 18 drivers generally may not pose an immediate hazard upon where or when they cannot assure such distance ahead is clear it is one of the most fundamental principles governing ordinary care and the duty of care for all methods of conveyance and is frequently used to determine if a driver is in proper control and is a nearly universally implicit consideration in vehicular accident liability 19 20 the rule is a precautionary trivial burden required to avert the great probable gravity of precious life loss and momentous damage 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 —the former of which has a priceless intrinsic value and a pricey to invaluable instrumental value 29 30 satisfying the acda rule is necessary but not sufficient to comply with the more generalized basic speed law and accordingly it may be used as both a laymans criterion and judicial test for courts to use in determining if a particular speed is negligent but not to prove it is safe 31 as a spatial standard of care it also serves as required explicit and fair notice of prohibited conduct so unsafe speed laws are not void for vagueness 32 33 34this distance is typically both determined and constrained by the proximate edge of clear visibility but it may be attenuated to a margin of which beyond hazards may reasonably be expected to spontaneously appear the rule is the specific spatial case of the common law basic speed rule 35 and an application of volenti non fit injuria the twosecond rule may be the limiting factor governing the acda when the speed of forward traffic is what limits the basic safe speed and a primary hazard of collision could result from following any closer 36as the original common law driving rule preceding statutized traffic law it is an ever important foundational rule in todays complex driving environment because there are now protected classes of roadway users–such as a school bus mail carrier emergency vehicle horsedrawn vehicle agricultural machinery street sweeper cyclist and pedestrian –as well as natural hazards which may occupy or obstruct the roadway beyond the edge of visibility negligence may not depend ex post facto on what a driver happened to hit could not have known but had a concurrent duty to avoid 35 37 furthermore modern knowledge of human factors has revealed physiological limitations–such as the subtended angular velocity detection threshold savt –which may make it difficult and in some circumstance impossible for other drivers to always comply with rightofway statutes by staying clear of

most legal doctrine governing problems which precede a legislative solution the acda principle generally originates to decisional precedent by high courts which reasoned general common sense rules of conduct of which naturally follow from the repetitive process of determining specific culpability 6 22 42 43 44 45 legislation often subsequently followed which either superfluously codified and endorsed or revised these principles 5 46 of which courts would in turn continue to flesh out the details 47 48 49 by the late 1920s the term assured clear distance ahead came into widespread use as the identity of a standard of care element in choosing safe speed 50 51 with differing jurisdictions adopting the language to carry its same effects 52 53 much of the earliest published record naturally pertains to high stakes wrecks 6 44 among vessels 54 or vehicles 55 as defined in those times though the obvious principle applies to chariots and might in fact be time immemorial 35 56 57present  edithorses may still be expected to use the roadways as well bicycles and automobiles 58 59 60 the former are a regular appearance in both urban areas and in the country and are commonly exercised by commuters and amish many roads are unchanged since the 1800s while controlledaccess highways have been invented specifically for the automobile 61 ships now have marine radar that allows one to view tens of miles beyond the eye at common law a motorist is required to regulate his speed so that he can stop within the range of his vision in numerous jurisdictions this rule has been incorporated in statutes which typically require that no person shall drive any motor vehicle in and upon any public road or highway at a greater speed than will permit him to bring it to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead 19 35decisional law usually settles the circumstances by which a portion of the roadway is assuredly clear without it being mentioned in statute 62 states where the judiciary has explicitly established the states acda law include indiana 63 iowa 49 kansas 64 louisiana 65 66 michigan 67 68 69 new york 70 north carolina 71 ohio 48 72 tennessee 45 73 vermont 74

require their courts to more inflexibly weigh the acda in their determination of reasonable speed or behavior such statutes do so in part by designating acda violations as a citable driving offense thus burdening an offending driver to rebut a presumption of negligence states with such explicit acda standard of care provisions include iowa 89 michigan 90 ohio 91 oklahoma 92 pennsylvania 93 and texas 94states which apply the principle by statute to watercraft on navigable waterways include all 171 member states of the international maritime organization 95 notwithstanding membership great

virginia 104most state issued driver handbooks either instruct or mention the acda rule as required care or safe practice 18 87 105 106 107 108 109 110explicit acda statutes and regulations 111 especially those of which create a citable driving or maritime offense are aimed at preventing harm that could result from potentially negligent behavior—whereas the slightly more obscure common law acda doctrine is most easily invoked to remedy actual damages that have already occurred as a result of such negligence unsafe speed statutes are immune from being void for vagueness 34 when they contain explicit acda clauses explicit and implicit acda rules govern millions of north american drivers universal standard of care  editnot all jurisdictions have applied the rule uniformly most often differing over exceptions for specific sudden emergencies there has been an increased interest in the acda codified as a universal standard of care 112 113 that has been brought about by recent technological and social changes such as event data recorders 114 115 dashcams selfdriving cars 116 117 safe cities and multiuse movements 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 and a movement to reduce claims by speeders against governments for dangerous conditions when operating speeds exceed a roads inferred design speed 129collision liability has historically benefited the law profession by being cloaked as a mixture of fact and law but with edrs precisely preserving a state of facts often repeated with differing trial outcomes collisions are less a question of fact but of law 112 113 130 131 132 electronic access to precise edr data and rulings with new ideological modeling tools can now expose judges as consistent political advocates for differing special road user interests 133 134 135 136 furthermore the law needs to be clear precise and uniform 137 138 at a national level for the panoply of automobile manufacturers with the strict liability for their programming of lawabiding selfdriving vehicles 116 117 it is foreseeable that two selfdriving car makes can collide because their algorithm of the law letter is different 116 a resolvable issue that has been troubling human drivers for decades the acda is a standard with descriptive mathematics much of which are used in reverse by road engineers when designing or reengineering roads to a speed criteria—for which its users were expected to follow 139in a trend epitomized by the great american streetcar scandal 136 140 and accelerated by red scare 141 hysteria automobile interests became very powerful through the 1980s even filing onesided amicus curiae briefs to narrow precedent making it difficult for all prior types of users to exercise their easement to the roadways its goal was towards making all roads controlledaccess highways in at least one jurisdiction it could no longer be said as a matter of law whether a cyclist is a discernible object for which a motorist with proper lookout had a duty to see an intolerant jury could fault a cyclist for being in the way notwithstanding that objects are less discernible and more sudden as one travels with reckless speed 72 common law precedent was eroded through the creation of distinctions where none really exists ie visibility of cyclist vs pedestrian vs warning triangle these successes inpart contributed to mass congestion smog high fuel prices and obesity which waned the power of this lobby and now green multimodal transportation is federally encouraged 119 120 121 122 the acda common law rule is more critical than ever to public safety in such multimodal environment a continued lack of such standard or its effective enforcement by both police and judges may substantially diminish the legality of humans ever driving in the future 142 143 144 145 146determining the acda  editstatic acda  editforward lineofsight distance  editthe range of visibility of which is the de facto acda is usually that distance before which an ordinary person can see small hazards—such as a traffic cone or buoy —with 2020 vision this distance may be attenuated by specific conditions such as atmospheric opacity 80 blinding glare 147 darkness 18 81 road design 79 148 and adjacent environmental hazards including civil and recreational activities 35 horsedrawn vehicle 59 ridden animal 59 livestock 59 deer 149 crossing traffic 37 and parked cars the acda may also be somewhat attenuated on roads with lower functional classification 25 35 148 this is because the probability of spontaneous traffic increases proportionally to the density of road access points and this density reduces the distance a person exercising ordinary care can be assured that a road will be clear such reduction in the acda is readily apparent from the conditions even when a specific access point or the traffic thereon is not 150 note 2 furthermore even though a throughdriver may typically presume all traffic will stay assuredly clear when required by law such driver may not take such presumption when circumstances provide actual knowledge under ordinary care that such traffic cannot obey the law 150 during times of darkness one can see ahead about 250 feet with low beams and about 350–500 feet with high beams 18 this clear distance corresponds to a maximum safe speed of 52 mph and 6581 mph respectively on dry pavement with good tires 151 which is attenuated further by convex and lateral road curvature safe speed is always dynamic intersections  editas a corollary to the rule that drivers generally may not pose an immediate hazard upon where or when they cannot assure such distance ahead is clear it follows that others may presume that no vehicle is posing an immediate hazard from beyond where they can see with proper lookout where there are cross roads or side roads with view obstructions the assured clear distance terminates at the closest path of potential users of the roadway until there is such a view which assures the intersection will remain clear in such situations approach speed must be reduced in preparation for entering or crossing a road or intersection or the unmarked pedestrian crosswalks 152 153 and bike paths 154 they create because of potential hazards 155 156 157 158 159 160 this jurisprudence arises inpart because of the known difficulty in estimating the distance and velocity of an approaching vehicle 160 40 41 which is psychophysically explained by its small angular size and belated divergence from an asymptotically null rate of expansion which is beyond the subtended angular velocity detection threshold savt limits of visual acuity 161 162 163 38 39 by way of the stevens power law 38 and weber–fechner law until the vehicle may be dangerously close subjective constancy and the visual angle illusion 164 may also play a role note 3 note 4 vehicles that are approaching an intersection from beyond the savt limit cannot be reliably distinguished between moving or parked though they may be traveling at such an imprudent speed as to pose an immediate hazard in this circumstance it is impossible for the entering driver to have fair notice that his or her contemplated conduct is forbidden by such hazard 32 41 and any legal expectation to the contrary would implicate violating the vagueness doctrine of the us constitution 32 note 5 it is the duty of the throughdriver to slow down 88 156 157 158 and apply the acda principle specifically to the intersection 18 35 57 148 37 see table of detection thresholds when approaching an unsignalized intersection controlled by a stop sign the assured clear distance ahead is normal acceleration  a i  for a passenger vehicle from a stop up to 20 mph is about 015g with more than 03g being difficult to exceed 155 the distance  d i  is the sum of the measured limit line setback distance—which is typically regulated by a manual on uniform traffic control devices at often between 4 and 30 feet in the united states 165 166 167 —and the crosswalk parking lane and road shoulder width a vehicle accelerating from a stop travels this distance in time t i √ 2d i ⁄ a i while through traffic travels a distance equal to their speed multiplied by that time the time t pc for the stopped motorist is the sum of perception time and the time required to actuate an automatic transmission or shift to first gear which is usually between 1⁄ 2 to one second 168acda as a function of horizontal sight distance  edithorizontal clearance is measured from the edge of the traveled way to the bottom of the nearest object tree trunk or shrub foliage mass face plant setback or mature growth 139 169 horizontal sight distance is not to be confused with the clear recovery zone which provides hazardous vegetation setback to allow errant vehicles to regain control and is exclusive to a mowed and limbedup forest which can allow adequate sight distance but unsafe recovery 169 the height and lateral distance of plants restrict the horizontal sight distance at times obscuring wildlife which may be spooked by an approaching vehicle and run across the road to escape with their herd 149 169 this principle also applies to approaching vehicles and pedestrians at uncontrolled intersections and to a lesser degree by unsignalized intersections controlled by a yield sign horizontal sight distance  d hsd  affects the acda because the time t i d hsd v i it takes for an intercepting object animal pedestrian or vehicle with speed  v i  to transverse this distance after emerging from the proximate edge of lateral visibility affords a vehicle with speed  v  a clear distance of  vt i  thus the assured clear intercept distance  acda si  is the faster one drives the farther downroad an interceptor must be in order to be able to transverse the horizontal sight distance in time to collide however this says nothing of whether the vehicle can stop by the end of this type of assured clear distance equating this distance to the total stopping distance and solving for speed yields ones maximum safe speed as purely dictated by the horizontal sight distance dynamic following distance  editthe acda may also be dynamic as to the moving distance past which a motorist can be assured to be able to stay clear of a foreseeable dynamic hazard—such as to maintain a distance as to be able to safely swerve around a bicyclist should he succumb to a fall—without requiring a full stop beforehand if doing so could be exercised with due care towards surrounding traffic quantitatively this distance is a function of the appropriate time gap and the operating speed d acdat gap⋅ v the assured clear distance ahead rule rather than being subject to exceptions is not really intended to apply beyond situations in which a vigilant ordinarily prudent person could or should anticipate 19 a common way to violate the dynamic acda is by tailgating measurement  editthe most accurate way to determine the acda is to directly measure it whereas this is impractical sight distance formulas can be used with less direct measurements as rough baseline estimates the empirical assured clear distance ahead calculated with computer vision range finding traction control and gis such as by properly programming computer hardware used in autonomous cars can be recorded to later produce or color baseline acda and safe speed maps for accident investigation traffic engineering and show disparities between safe speed and 85th percentile operating speed 170 selfdriving cars 117 171 may have a higher safe speed than human driven vehicles for a given acda where computer perceptionreaction times are nearly instantaneous discretion  editthe assured clear distance ahead can be subjective to the baseline estimate of a reasonable person or be predetermined by law for example whether one should have reasonably foreseen that a road was not assuredly clear past 75–100 meters because of tractors or livestock which commonly emerge from encroaching blinding vegetation is on occasion dependent on societal experience within the locale in certain urban environments a straight trafficless throughstreet may not necessarily be assuredly clear past the entrance of the nearest visually obstructed intersection as law 35 148 150 160 within the assured clear distance ahead there is certainty that travel will be free from obstruction which is exclusive of a failure to appreciate a hazard collisions generally only occur within ones assured clear distance ahead which are unavoidable to them such that they have zero comparative negligence including legal acts of god and abrupt unforeseeably wanton negligence by another party hazards which penetrate ones proximate edge of clear visibility and compromise their acda generally require evasive action drivers need not and are not required to precisely determine the maximum safe speed from realtime mathematical calculations of sight distances and stopping distances for their particular vehicle 40 motor vehicle operators of average intelligence 113 172 are constantly required to utilize their kinesthetic memory in all sorts of driving tasks including every time they brake to a full stop at a stop line in a panoply of conditions 77 173 like throwing a softball one does not have to mathematically calculate a trajectory or firing solution in order to hit a target with repeated accuracy during the earliest stages of learning how to drive one develops a memory of when to start braking how long it takes from various speeds in order to stop at the limit line 173 while there may be a degree of variance of such skill in seasoned drivers they generally do not have the discretion in engaging in a behavior such as driving a speed above which no reasonable minds might differ as to whether it is unsafe or that one could come to a stop within the full distance ahead 158 172seconds of distance to stop rule  editdrivers and law enforcement alike can apply elementary level arithmetic 174 towards a rule of thumb to estimate minimal stopping distance in terms of how many seconds of travel ahead at their current speed for speed  v  in miles per hour this rule of thumb is as follows seconds of distance to stop ruleif this distance is greater than the acda they need to slow down while most experienced drivers develop a broad intuition required by everyday braking 173 this rule of thumb can still benefit some to recalibrate expectations for rare hard braking particularly from high speeds additional simple corrections can be made to compensate for the environment and driving ability read more about the seconds of distance to stop rule acda rule specific case generalized to the basic speed law  editthe acda distances are a principal component to be evaluated in the determination of the maximum safe speed v bsl under the basic speed law without which the maximum safe speed cannot be determined as mathematical statements are more precise than verbal statements alone 21 the relation of the acda as a subset of the basic speed rule for land based vehicles may be objectively quantified as follows μ e g2 g μ e2 g μ e the value of the variable e is the sine of the angle of inclination of the roads slope for a level road this value is zero and for small angles it approximates the roads percent grade divided by one hundred note 6the maximum velocity permitted by the assured clear distance ahead is controlling of safe speed v bsl for only the top and two cases safe speed may be greater or less than the actual legal speed limit depending upon the conditions along the road 155 note 7see reference v bslderivations for basic physics explanation acda forward lineofsight  editfor the top case the maximum speed is governed by the assured clear lineofsight as when the following distance aft of forward traffic and steering control are both adequate common examples include when there is no vehicle to be viewed or when there is a haze or fog that would prevent visualizing a close vehicle in front this maximum velocity is denoted by the case variable the friction coefficient is symbolized by —and itself a function of the tire type and road conditions the distance is the static acda the constant is the acceleration of gravity and interval is the perceptionreaction time —usually between 10 and 25 seconds 175 176see table of safe speed versus forward lineofsight acda horizontal lineofsight  editthe second case describes the relationship of horizontal sight distance on safe speed it is the maximum speed at which a vehicle can come to a full stop before an object with speed v can intercept after having emerged and traveled across the horizontal sight distance d hsd  urban and residential areas have horizontal sight distances that tend to be closely obstructed by parked cars utility poles street furnishing fencing signage and landscaping but have slower intercepting speeds of children pedestrians backing cars and domestic animals these interceptors combined with dense usage results in collisions that are more probable and much more likely to inflict harm to an outside human life in rural areas swiftmoving spooked wildlife such as deer 149 elk moose and antelope are more likely to intercept a roadway at over 30 mph 48 kph wildlife will frequently transit across a road before a full stop is necessary however collisions with large game are foreseeably lethal and a driver generally has a duty not to harm his or her passengers the foreseeable intercept speed or defectively designed horizontal sight distance may vary reasonably with judicial discretion see table of safe speed versus horizontal lineofsight acda intersectional setback  editthis third case regards safe speed around unsignalized intersections where a driver on an uncontrolled though street has a duty to slow down in crossing an intersection and permit controlled drivers to be able pass through the intersection without danger of collision 158 the driver on the through street must anticipate and hence not approach at an unsafe speed which would prevent another driver from being able to enter while traffic was some distance away or would be unsafe to a driver who has already established control of the intersection under a prudent acceleration a from a stop at a limit line a distance d sl away 168acda following distance  editthe pedantic fourth case applies when the dynamic acda following distance d acda d is less than the static acda lineofsight distance d acda s  a classic instance of this occurs when from a visibility perspective it would be safe to drive much faster were it not for a slowermoving vehicle ahead as such the dynamic acda is governing the basic speed rule because in maintaining this distance one cannot drive at a faster speed than that matching the forward vehicle the time gap t g or time cushion is the time required to travel the dynamic acda or following distance at the operating speed circumstances depending this cushion might be manifested as a twosecond rule or threesecond rule see table of 2second following distances critical speed  editin the fifth case critical speed v cs applies when road curvature is the factor limiting safe speed a vehicle which exceeds this speed will slide out of its lane critical speed is a function of curve radius r superelevation or banking e and friction coefficient μ 155 the constant g again is the acceleration of gravity however most motorists will not tolerate a lateral acceleration exceeding 03g μ03 above which many will panic 177 hence critical speed may not resemble loss of control speed 177 attenuated side friction coefficients are often used for computing critical speed 169 the formula is frequently approximated without the denominator for low angle banking which may be suitable for nearly all situations except the tightest radius of highway onramps 169 178 the principle of critical speed is often applied to the problem of traffic calming where curvature is both used to govern maximum road speed and used in traffic circles as a device to force drivers to obey their duty to slow down when approaching an intersection 156 157see table of curvatures and critical speeds surface control  editthe bottom case is invoked when the maximum velocity for surface control v cl is otherwise reached steering control is independent from any concept of clear distance ahead if a vehicle cannot be controlled so as to safely remain within its lane above a certain speed and circumstance then it is irrelevant how assuredly clear the distance is ahead using the example of the previous case the safe speed on a curve may be such that a driver experiences a lateral acceleration of less than 03g despite that the vehicle may not slide until it experiences 08g speed wobble hydroplaning roll center fishtailing jackknife tendencies potholes washboarding frost heaving 179 and tire speed rating are other factors limiting v cl safe speed  editsafe speed is the maximum speed permitted by the basic speed law and negligence doctrine safe speed is not the same as the 85 percentile operating speed 180 used by traffic engineers in establishing speed zones 155 165 181 182 fog snow or ice can create conditions where most people drive too fast and chain reaction accidents in such conditions are examples of where large groups of drivers collided because they failed to reduce speed for the conditions 155 183 the speeds at which most people drive can only be a very rough guide to safe speed 155 and an illegal or negligent custom or practice is not in itself excusable 84 113 184 safe speed approximates the inferred design speed adjusted for environmental alterations and vehicle and person specific factors when v acda s is the limiting factor 185 the solomon curve concept can create an approachavoidance conflict within the driver who wishes neither to drive faster than is lawful and the conditions allow nor have an unsafe speed discrepancy between other vehicles on the road it is never legal to go faster than the speed limit and unilaterally reducing the risk of the latter can lead to a mass crash caused by the former 183relationship of posted speed limits to the explicitness of driver care standard  editdistance seen with ece light by night many people are challenged by the concept of unsafe speed because they find it vague and arbitrary 34 it is well known that people instead resolve such challenges by attribute substitution 186 which in this case can mean simply emulating the behaviors of others in accord with the cultural theory of risk indeed a substantial part of a drivers risk perception comes from comparing their contemplated conduct to the behavior of others this includes the safeness of a given speed notwithstanding the actual risk as a result of this uncorrected vagueness group behavior can often be in opposition to safe speed and still be governing a hazardous posted speed limit by federal law posted speed limits are generally within 5 mph of the 85thpercentile speed of freeflowing traffic 139 165 181 182 187 functionality this amounts to citizens voting a streets speed limit with their gas pedal from the influence of groupshift as people generally follow explicit rules all the time of which they do not agree it is often simply a jurisdictions failure in their law to sufficiently quantify and disseminate fair notice of an explicit standard of care such as the acda rule most dmv driver manuals teach the practice but far fewer states explicitly back it up in their actual statutes and law enforcement 18 87 105 106 if drivers were mindful of the acda the operating speed would by definition not exceed the inferred design speed 139 182 in some cases police focused on driving while influenced and pull over slower quartile sober nighttime drivers moving no faster than they can stop within the radius of their headlights 18 this discourages adjusting speed downward from anything but the posted maximum speed permitted by law—which is determined as previously described famous tragedies  editactor james dean s 85 mph car crash princess dianas death and the sinking of the rms titanic 22 47 188 after colliding with an iceberg at night are all well publicized tragedies which resulted from a failure to maintain an assured clear distance ahead assurance beyond proximate edge of clear visibility as transference of liability  edita general principle in liability doctrine is than an accident which would not have occurred except for the action or inaction of some person or entity contrary to a duty such as the exercise of proper care was the result of negligence the liability space from which one can recover 189 is typically themselves other parties or nobody 190 jurisdictional exceptions permitting one to legally take assurance that the distance will be clear beyond the proximate edge of clear visibility and choose such a speed accordingly transfers classic common law liability from that driver for his or her blind actions this duty to assure clear distance ahead is inevitably transferred as an externality to everybody or thing else who must instead warn the driver such as the government its road engineers and maintainers 85 129 191as it is generally probable and foreseeable that chance will permit and at some point there will be an obstruction beyond some drivers line of sight such an entitlement challenges centuries 6 42 of precedent in negligence doctrine in addition to posing difficult policy and engineering challenges it also violates the calculus of negligence 21 because speed is an inherent factor in vehicular accidents which are a leading cause of priceless life loss 23 26 27 29 30 160 and lawsuits and the burden of a precautions speed is radically lower than the former 30the assumption of risk resulting from the unsafe activity of driving faster than one can stop within ones vision does not depend ex post facto on what you happened to hit for which by nature you could not have known it could have been a moose or a luxury car furthermore modern times still provide no legal remedies for darwinian misfortune upon the entire class of unwarnable accidents where drivers and their passengers would not have collided into the likes of a moose 149 livestock 59 fallen tree rock jetsam horsedrawn vehicle 59 stalled vehicle 192 school bus garbage truck mail carrier snowplow washout snow drift or slid off the road were it not for their decisions to drive faster than dictated by the assured clear distance ahead regardless of what behavior an authority might encourage by fabricating new rights it remains timeless that constituents cannot sue the wind for causing a wreck when it inevitably violates a modern right to drive faster than permitted by the acda by failing to warning them it knocked down a tree in a forest with lots of trees which all eventually fall down in this specific regard jurisdictions which grant drivers the liberty to be fools from their own folly are also condoning the collateral damage and life loss which is expected to occur moreover modern lifeentrusting consumers of driving services and driverless cars 117 who suffer such caused injury are left without legal remedy for foreseeable outcome of imprudent speed this inturn unnecessarily transfers a substantive portion of the acda liability space into act of god government claims strict liability or other findings from legal fiction which the justice system generally abhors what modern times are changing is that one may assure the distance is clear ahead virtually through the internet of things as smart cars connect to get information from smart highways or pass what they see ahead or measure to traffic behind 193 a fundamental corollary of the acda rule is that technology expectations and desires may modernize but the laws of physics can not and do not 56 57 the deceleration coefficients and reactions times may change from conveyance by chariot horse and buggy internal combustion engine electric motor and by driverless car but the equations governing stopping distances are immutable finally where it is the policy of the law not to fault well intending diligent citizens for innocent mistakes 40 41 human life reaps continued benefit from the acda duty of which instills the necessary room to survive uninjured from such foreseeable and excusable error while adding redundancy in the responsibility to avoid a collision mere unilateral duties laid down to assure the safety of others tend to result in hazardous risk compensation by those unfettered parties 194 resulting in a moral hazard allowing one to drive faster than their vision permits them to safely stop results in there being no core standard of care regarding safe speed making unsafe speed laws void for vagueness 33 the acda minimum standard gives fair notice of what conduct is prohibited and people of ordinary intelligence can apply their braking experience or the seconds of distance to stop rule to the distance they can see 173 once one is allowed to cruiseon without control beyond the edge of visibility there is little consensus on what arbitrary speed is unsafe or what to assume of the vague conditions therepast 34to be able to guarantee assurance beyond proximate edge of clear visibility in doing so exempting acda duty a road must be designed and maintained such that there is not a chance of obstruction in ones lane beyond the proximate edge of clear visibility a roads vertical profile must be assured to have such a curvature as not to hide hazards close behind its crests discretion for drivers and pedestrians to enter onto a potentially occupied lane from a side street must be assuredly eliminated such as with fences merge lanes or signalized access there must also be an assurance of no opportunity for animals and debris to enter from side lots and that there are continuous multihourly maintenance patrols performed furthermore such road sections must be distinguished from other roads so that the driver could clearly and immediately know when he or she may or may not take such extended assurance few roads might meet these requirements except some of the highest functional classification controlledaccess highways such as freeways and autobahns 25even if such criteria are met the law must also exempt driver liability for maintaining clear distance ahead in most democracies such liability for failures of the distance to remain clear beyond line of sight would ultimately be transferred to its taxpayers 129 this only generally occurs when governments have been tasked by constituents or their courts to take the responsibly to design and maintain roadways that assure the distance will be clear beyond the proximate edge of clear visibility pressures to make such changes may arise from cultural normalization of deviance and unnecessary risk misunderstanding the purpose of the road functional classification system underestimation of increased risk and reclamation of commute time 25one of the greatest difficulties created by such an extension of the acda is the frequency at which roads reduce their functional classification 25 unbeknownst to drivers who continue unaware they have lost this extended assurance or dont understand the difference such nuance in applicable jurisdictions is a prolific source of accidents 156 in the united states there is no explicit road marking promising clear distance beyond line of sight in the manual on uniform traffic control devices although there are signs communicating  limited sight distance   hill blocks view   crossroad ahead  and  freeway ends  195 a partial solution to this challenge is to remove driver discretion in determining whether the acda is extended beyond line of sight by explicitly designating this law change to certain marked high functional classification roadways having meet strict engineering criteria 25the acda rule is analogous to aviation visual flight rules and its discussed exception—allowed only in a well regulated control zone—is analogous to instrument flight rules unlike both visual and instrumental flight rules where federal and international administrative law applies seamlessly and uniformly across the states the acda rule governing ground transportation is relatively variegated across states and judicial circuits 33 70 138 196 197 primitive patchwork governance over a prominent interstate commercial subject

care representative of everyone while ignoring its insensitivity to sample size which of course when applied to multiple cases involving identical situational circumstances results in many verdicts with opposing extreme views 113 which works against the utility of the law by making it arbitrarily vague 112 113 a national uniformity standard which either administratively lays down the acda law as has been done for aircraft or requires states to legislatively enact in order to receive federal dot funding as has been done for the national legal drinking age is a subject of debate for those who argue far more people die in cars than in aircraft 23 26 160 201 while group polarization towards safety has shifted the criminal blood alcohol threshold below levels for which the risk is statistically marginal 24 202 the tolerance for speeding—of which each speed unit increment carries an equatable risk relative to bac 24 —remains relatively neglected speed is responsible for more

fillingin and spectacular failure such as the ebbinghaus illusion delboeuf illusion and ponzo illusion such honest human error insidiously arises through unconscious inferences from insufficient distracting or illusory information—it is especially important to foresee such hazard at intersections under the worstcase scenario a driver will make decisions alone based upon the looming motion of oncoming headlights or silhouette of an anonymous vehicle which must reach a certain proximity in order to exceed the visual expansion acuity threshold given a vehicle of size and distance the visual angle is its derivative with respect to distance is an approaching vehicle of constant velocity will decrease the distance at rate the time rate of visual expansion is obtained from the rate at which the subtended angle grows with decreased distance multiplied by the rate at which the distance lessens with time it follows that hence an approaching vehicles looming motion is not perceivable until where the s 24 term is omitted with smallangle approximation the units of measurement for size distance and velocity variables must be of the same system ie multiply by 2215 to convert mph to fts or

prudence would choose at such a place out of due regard for his own safety or that of others such speed may not be unusual at the present time even under similar circumstances but the person who
