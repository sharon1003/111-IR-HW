glasses  is a huge businessand completely unnecessary for normal visionjust as most people breathe incorrectly due to the lack of proper knowledge they also take care of theireyes incorrectly people believe that when needed they can go visit the eye “doctor” who will solve the problem this is only seemingly true because everything these doctors do or recommend in reality ruins your eyes do notconfuse these two definitions one is vision  the visual acuity the other is the eye as an organ yes with thehelp of the eye doctor you can improve your vision but the eye itself will only get worse this can be proven bythe simple fact that once you start wearing glasses you have to go get a new prescription for yourglassescontact lenses constantly and more frequently and you always get “stronger” ones i got interested in vision problems a long time ago i started reading properly at around the age of 4 andbecause my parents constantly forbid me to read excessively i quite often in case of an interesting book hadto do it during the night underneath a thick blanket and with a flashlight as the only source of light even thoughby the time i went to first grade i had read more books than some people do in their lifetime like this theavoidance of my parents’ rule did not go “unpunished” by the time i went to school my eyes where already … 55 dioptres even though i then started to limit “using” my eyes as much as school studies allowed my shortsightedness gradually got worse when i reached highschool i consoled myself with the fact that i was now“disabled” and did not have to join the army after graduating studying at the leningrad institute i had the opportunity and the honour of meeting a medical professor whowas highly skilled at hypnotizing using me as a test subject we thought about developing a way to treat theeyes using hypnosis because interestingly i could see clearly while under hypnosis but after that my visionwas blurred again our aim was to find a way to maintain the visual acuity even after coming out of hypnosis nobody knows where or if we could have ended up with this but… a bad and jealous person complainedabout us and because during the soviet times it was strictly forbidden to use hypnosis without governmentcontrol then “with the help of the party and the government” we were permanently separated after this i “hung up my hat” and obediently started wearing glasses the highschool hope  getting out of armyrecruitment was not realized because thanks to the leningrad “experimental” education and my generalknowledge i was not released of service time however i also never had to do the customary “drills” during mytime in the army only things that were not hindered by wearing glasses i feel extremely sorry that free access to all the knowledge in the world with the quickness of the internet onlyreached me when i had already gathered a relatively large number of years on my “back” and laziness“between my bones” be that as it may i was pleasantly surprised to discover a man called william horatio bates m d 18601931 who had been active in “the world of eyes” as soon as i had read up on his vision theory and practicaltests i was tormented by the question “why do eye doctors who have to take care of peoples’ eyes notbring out this alternative possibility to get good vision” why in general is there extremely little talkabout eye care i would like to bring out a few pictures from the internet as an example
