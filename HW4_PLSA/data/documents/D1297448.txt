science  mathematics biology difference between atp and adp i understand that the structural difference between atp and adp is that atp has 3 phosphates and adp has 2 i also understand that atp acts as an immediate energy source for cells but i dont quite get the function of adp is the function just to be changed into atp again1 following 4 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer adp is a product of atp adenasediphosphate and adenasetriphosphate as the name suggests diphosphate is only 2 phosphate and tri tphosphate is 3 phosphate during the process of converting atp to adp one phosphate is lost jess 路 10 years ago0 3 comment when the phosphate is lost from atp then the energy it is carrying is released so basically adp is just what you get when atp has been used you could say adp is like a rechargable battery waiting to be chargedcheetara2001 路 10 years ago3 0 comment atp is adenosine triphosphate and is what is called a high energy phosphate that is the bond bewteen the 2nd and the third phosphate is unstable and contains a fair amount of energy that is given off when atp is hydrolyzed to adp estimates of  7upwards of 9 kcal have been noted for this hydroysis atp is called the energy currency of the cell and its hydrolysis is used to run many uphill reactions madhu 路 2 years ago0 0 comment atp  adenosine triphosphate which means its has 3 phosphate molecules attached adp  adenosine diphosphate which means it has 2 phosphate molecules attached this is produced when a phospahet group is taken off atp to release approx 305kj mol1 energy amp  adenosine monophosphate which means it has one phosphate molecule attached this is produced when the second phosphate molecule is removed from atp to give off a further 142kjmol1 energy removing the final phosphate molecule also gives 142kjmol1 energy babagknowsall 路 10 years ago1 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these how does cloud computing work find moving container services online education an option want to build a free website
