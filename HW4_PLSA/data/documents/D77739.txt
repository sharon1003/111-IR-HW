hi was going to replace a plastic light switch 1 bulb onoff with a chrome version the existing cable into the light switch is 2 core and earth so it should be easy to connect the earth to the back of the switch plate however when lifting floorboards i found the following junction box type thing url httppicasawebgooglecomelliottfjoneselectricsphoto5036157111535113538 it looks like most of the lighting cables for upstairs feed into it and some but not all of the earths have been loosely wound together so my question is how i can test if the earth cable feeding into the light switch is actually connectedearthed cheers elliott
