i know a husky has a thick double coat of fur and the summers can get really hot especially down here in the south i have even been told by some husky owners that the dog groomer recommended clipping their huskies coat for the summer so it would be cooler on the dog the answer is nonever under any circumstances should you clip your siberian huskies coat off this misconception that a husky will be cooler in the summer heat by clipping it’s coat will cause the exact opposite to happen not only will your husky be hotter by clipping off it’s coat you would be taking away the only thing that is protecting it from sunburns a huskies skin is sensitive to the sun and would burn easily if exposed all that thick fur on your dog is keeping it cool and protecting it from the sun most siberian huskies with long coats will take the heat better than a short haired dog because it is actually cooler with the long hair the best way to keep your husky cool in the summertime is to provide plenty of shade and fresh water if it lives outdoors a small kids sized pool with a few inches of water would be nice too just change the water every couple of days or when it gets really dirty your husky will lay in the water and it’s long coat will soak up the water and act as an air conditioner on your dog keeping it nice and cool trust me they love the water in the summertime my huskies start howling about 7 am i go let them out of the kennels and instead of getting a nice morning greeting they all run past me and jump into our swimming pool and take a swim once they are all soaking wet they get out and come running at me to greet me and get me wet sometimes i run for cover and they chase me but they usually catch me lol if you take your husky to a groomer and they suggest clipping your huskies coat for the summer you may want to find a new dog groomer or educate them about why a husky should never have it’s fur cut off more from my site should you use the furminator on a siberian husky huskies playing fetch in the pool siberian huskies playing what are the symptoms of heartworms in dogs popular yard plants that are poisonous to your dog related posts paisley’s puppies 2 weeks old the siberian husky cheat sheet paisley’s husky puppies 1 week old can you walk a husky off the leash luna’s puppies first time outside on december 13 2013  blog siberian husky health1 comment dogs n pawz302 am on december 15 2013great post i have labs and of course i don’t clip their coats when it is hot outside but you hear so many things about it being okay to clip to it not being okay to clip thanks for sharing dogs n pawz recently posted… whole foods launches new line of pet food for dogs and cats whole foods pets
