how to setup the elgato game capture hd in obslike tweet 1 reddit welcome to this guide which will show you how to setup your elgato game capture hd in obs before we continue please make sure you have each of these your elgato game capture hd plugged in and setup with your console the game capture hd softwaredrivers installed obs 32 bit installed step 1 open obs 32bit and go to the settings step 2 general make a new profile for the purpose of this tutorial we’ll call it “game capture hd” then click “add”step 3 encoding leave the encoder on “x264” leave both cbr and vbr checked these are twitch requirements run a speedtest to find out your approximate upload speed now you have some options depending on your upload speed you can do a few things if 75 of your upload speed equates to 3400kbps which is the maximum twitch will take then you can set your upload speed to that be warned however that many people cannot watch a stream with that high bit rate for new streamers a good balance between quality and watchability is 2000kbps you will also need to take into consideration your own internet upload speed if your maximum is 2mbps 2000kbps then you may want to set your upload to 1500kbps for audio encoding select aac set the format to 48k hz and select a bit rate remember audio bit rate will add to the total bit rate being streamed to twitch and your viewers a good balance between quality and bit rate is 96 as for mono or stereo the option is up to you but we recommend stereo step 4 broadcast settings for mode choose “live stream”streaming service is of course twitchjustintv don’t worry you will only stream to twitchserver should be the closest one to you if you are not sure we recommend you use jtvping to find the closest one to you your pathkeystream key can be found by going to twitch then your dashboard and then the “stream key” tab hit “show” and copy and paste the full stream key including any letters into obs note never show your stream key publicly or give it to anyone you don’t trust keep “auto reconnect” checked this is useful when there is a sudden disconnect or network error obs will automatically try to start up the stream again you should not need to touch “minimize network impact” if you do have network issues ask on the obs forums first save to file is a very useful option what this does is it will save an exact copy of your stream to a folder of your choosing this can be useful for cutting out stream highlights for you tube later if you decide to use this feature the naming of the files is a little weird if you name the file  then the name of the saved file will be datetimemp4 if you name the file ““stream recording” the first time you stream it will be “stream recording” and the next time it will be “stream recording1” hopefully in obs studio obs 20 there will be a more graceful solution hotkeys who doesn’t like hotkeys if you choose to use hotkeys make sure they are not close to any keys you use often you don’t want to accidentally start andor stop your stream ignore any warnings obs is giving you we will fix them step 5 video do not touch “video adapter” this will be set to your graphics card base resolution should be set to “custom” and 1080p to get a nice looking stream and reduce obs’s cpu usage downscaling the stream by 150x to 1280x720p is recommended set the filter to “lanczos” set the fps to 30 this is a limitation from the game capture hd if the game capture hd receives 1080p video from the console the maximum recordingstreaming fps is 30 step 6 audio desktop audio device will be whatever your computer audio is playing through in most cases this will be your headphones microphone is pretty self explanatory keep it on default to use your default computer mic for obs if you have a headset mic and a usb mic like a blue yeti connected you may need to manually select the blue yeti“show only connected devices” should be checked this makes sure you don’t select anything that isn’t actually there which can cause problems if you want to use pushtotalk that is up to you we now need to change “mic time offset” there is about a 1415 second delay from what happens on your tvmonitor to when the game capture hd shows it on your computer for this reason we need to delay the mic by the same amount of time so that the video and audio is synced a good offset time to start at is 1500ms you might need to change this to 1450ms or 1550ms or even higher or lower depending on your experience there is currently a bug in obs where the delay from the game capture hd increases over time this may not be resolved in this version of obs step 7 advanced multithreaded optimizations keep this checked process priority class do not change unless issues arise in which case you should ask on the obs forums first leave all other settings in the general box as they are x264 preset next to bit rate and resolution changing this settings can effect the quality of your stream a lot as well as much cpu obs uses the slower the preset the better the video quality but the more cpu obs will use this list can help you determine which preset you can use intel dual core intel i3 23xx or higher ultrafastsuperfast quad core intel i5 25xx or higher veryfastfaster8core intel i7 26xx or higher fastmedium12core intel i7 3930k or higher slow amd due to the low speedipc instructions per clock of amd cpu’s it is generally not recommended to stream with a dual core or lower amd fx series amd fx 4100 or higher ultrafastveryfast amd fx 6100 or higher veryfastfaster amd fx 8320 or higher fastmedium note any x264 preset beyond slow will provide for very little image quality gain and exponential cpu usage increase we do not recommend going above medium unless you have a monster cpu or extreme over clock encoding profile set this to main if you set it to high there will be a marginal video quality increase but some phonestablets may not be able to view your stream keyframe set to 2 this is a twitch requirement use cfr keep this checked do not touch any of the other settings unless you have extensive knowledge of x264 obs and video encoding or if you are having issues and have been instructed so on the obs forums step 8 noise gate this is something you can play around with on your own but simply it will mute your microphone when you are not talking this may be useful for people with a lot of background noise step 9 adding a scene now that you have configured your settings we can start setting up the elgato game capture hd in obs in the left hand box at the bottom

select a different input to do this right click on the game capture hd source click on properties once you have the device window open click on “configure”  note to configure the game capture hd device the preview must be on the game capture hd device option panel should come up allowing you to change settings like resolution which feeds to obs and input step 18 moar testingkeep the preview open and running and play a couple minutes keep an eye on obs if it shows warnings like “taking to long to encode” you have to lower the x264 preset if other errors come up don’t be afraid to ask on the obs forums this is also the time to test your mic volume add a webcam add overlays and more step 19 stream once you have setup the scenes and sources stop the preview and click on stream you are
