art and science of preserving human remains by treating them in its modern form with chemicals to forestall decomposition the intention is to keep them suitable for public display at a funeral for religious reasons it helps preserve the body for many years 1 the three goals of embalming are sanitization presentation preservation and in some cases restoration embalming has a very long and crosscultural history with many cultures giving the embalming processes a greater religious meaning embalming is distinct from taxidermy embalming preserves the human body intact whereas taxidermy is the recreation of an animals form often using only the creatures skin mounted on an anatomical form embalming also differs from anatomical wetting in which medical specimens including cadavers are preserved for further study and research anatomical wetting does not concern with the overall appearance and uses different chemicals than a traditional funerary embalming contents  hide 1 history11

are among the earliest cultures known to have performed artificial mummification as early as 50006000 bc 1perhaps the ancient culture that had developed embalming to the greatest extent was egypt as early as the first dynasty 3200 bc specialized priests were in charge of embalming and mummification they did so by removing organs ridding the body of moisture and covering the body with natron 2 the ancient egyptians believed that preservation of the mummy empowered the soul after death the latter of which would return to the preserved corpse other cultures known to have used embalming techniques in antiquity include the meroites guanches peruvians jivaro indians aztecs toltecs mayans and tibetan and southern nigerian tribes 1the earliest known evidence of artificial preservation in europe was found in osorno spain and are about 5000 years old human bones covered in cinnabar for preservation but embalming remained unusual in europe up to the time of the roman empire 1in china artificially preserved remains have been recovered from the period of the han dynasty 206 bc – 220 ad the main examples being that of xin zhui and the mawangdui han tombs site while these remains have been extraordinarily well preserved the embalming fluids and methods used are unknown 1in europe the knowledge and practice of artificial preservation had spread from these ancient cultures becoming widely spread by about 500 ad the period of the middle ages and the renaissance is known as the anatomists period of embalming and is characterized by an increased inﬂuence of scientific developments in medicine and the need of bodies for dissection purposes early methods used are documented by contemporary physicians such as peter forestus 1522–1597 and ambroise pare 15101590 the first attempts to inject the vascular system were made by alessandro giliani of persiceto who died in 1326 various attempts and procedures have been reported by leonardo da vinci 14521519 jacobus berengar 1470–1550 bartholomeo eustachius 1520–1574 reinier de graaf 1641–1673 jan swammerdam 1637–1680 and frederik ruysch 1638–1731 1modern methods  editin the united states the civil war era sparked an interest in embalming and it became very common across the nation 3william hunter developed and popularized the modern technique of arterial embalming in the late 18th century the modern method of embalming involves the injection of various chemical solutions into the arterial network of the body to primary disinfect and slow the decomposition process william harvey the 17th century english physician who was the first to detail the system of blood circulation made his discoveries by injecting coloured solutions into corpses the scottish surgeon william hunter was the first to apply these methods to the art of embalming as part of mortuary practice he wrote a widely read report on the appropriate methods for arterial and cavity embalming in order to preserve bodies for burial his brother john hunter applied these methods and advertised his embalming services to the general public from the mid18th century one of his more notorious customers was the dentist martin van butchell when his wife mary died on january 14 1775 he decided to have her embalmed and turn her into an attraction in order to draw more customers hunter injected the body with preservatives and color additives that gave a glow to the corpses cheeks replaced her eyes with glass eyes and dressed her in a fine lace gown the body was then embedded in a layer of plaster of paris in a glasstopped coffin 4butchell put the body on display in the window of his home many londoners came to see the body but butchell also drew criticism on his gruesome display a rumor possibly started by butchell himself claimed that his wifes marriage certificate had specified that her husband would only have control over her estate after her death for as long as her body was kept unburied 5interest in and demand for embalming grew steadily in the 19th century largely for sentimental reasons people wished to be buried at faroff locations and mourners wanted the chance to display the body for visitors to pay their last respects to another motive behind embalming at this time was to prevent the spread of disease while being able to prepare for burial without unseemly haste after lord nelson was killed during the battle of trafalgar his body was preserved in brandy and spirits of wine mixed with camphor and myrrh for over two months at the time of his state funeral in 1805 his body was found to still be in excellent condition and completely plastic 6embalming fluids used in the early 20th century alternative methods of preservation such as ice packing or laying the body on so called cooling boards gradually lost ground to the increasingly popular and effective methods of embalming by the mid 19th century the newly emerging profession of businessmenundertakers  who provided funeral and burial services  began adopting embalming methods as standard embalming caught on in the united states during the american civil war as a result of sentimental issues involving foreign officials and servicemen dying far from home and the need for their remains to be returned home for local burial this period starting at about 1861 is known as the funeral period of embalming and is marked by a separation of the fields of embalming by funeral directors and embalming anatomical wetting for medical and scientific purposes 1 dr thomas holmes received a commission from the army medical corps to embalm the corpses of dead union officers to return to their families military authorities also permitted private embalmers to work in militarycontrolled areas the passage of abraham lincoln s body home for burial was made possible by embalming and it brought the possibilities and potential of embalming to a wider public notice until the early 20th century arsenic was frequently used as an embalming fluid until it was supplanted by other more effective and less toxic chemicals there was concern about the possibility of arsenic from embalmed bodies contaminating ground water supplies there were also legal concerns because people suspected of murder by arsenic poisoning could claim that the levels of poison in the deceaseds body were a result of postmortem embalming rather than evidence of homicide in 1867 the german chemist august wilhelm von hofmann discovered formaldehyde whose preservative properties were soon discovered and which became the foundation for modern methods of embalming replacing previous methods dr frederic ryusch was the first one to have used the arterial injection method for embalming his work of embalming was so nearly perfect that people thought the dead body was actually alive however he only used it to prepare specimens for his anatomical work 7today  editmodern embalming is most often performed to ensure a better presentation of the deceased for viewing by friends and relatives a successful viewing of the body is considered to be helpful in the grieving process 8 9 embalming has the potential to prevent mourners from having to deal with the rotting and eventual putrescence of the corpse 10this view has been challenged however by authors such as jessica mitford who point out that there is no general consensus that viewing an embalmed corpse is somehow therapeutic to the bereaved and that terms such as memory picture were invented by the undertakers themselves who have a financial interest in selling the costly process of embalming to the public mitford also points out that in many countries embalming is rare and the populace of such countries are still able to grieve normally 11embalming is also a general legal requirement for international repatriation of human remains although exceptions do occur and by a variety of laws depending on locality such as for extended time between death and final disposition or aboveground entombment in the united kingdom viewing the deceased prior to the funeral is a common practice and embalming will be recommended to prevent any natural deterioration of the remains which would cause further distress to family and friends it is not uncommon however for a persons coffin to return home or to be received into a place of religious worship prior to burial or cremation in this instance the embalming process will carried out terms for embalmers  editthe roles of a funeral director and an embalmer are different depending on the licensing body for a region in which the funeral director andor embalmer operate a funeral director arranges for the final disposition of the deceased and may or may not prepare including embalming the deceased for viewing or other legal requirements an embalmer is someone who has been trained in the art and science of and may or may not have any contact with the family although many people fill both roles the term mortician is becoming outdated but may refer to a someone who is a funeral director an embalmer or in some cases both embalming training commonly involves formal study in anatomy thanatology chemistry and specific embalming theory to widely varied levels depending on the region of the world one lives in combined with practical instruction in a mortuary with a resultant formal qualification granted after the passing of a final practical examination and acceptance into a recognized society of professional embalmers legal requirements over who can practice vary geographically some regions or countries do not have specific requirements additionally in many places embalming is not done by trained embalmers but rather by doctors who while they have the required anatomical knowledge are not trained specialists in this field today embalming is common practice in north america and new zealand while it is somewhat less frequent in europe in some countries permits or licenses are required in others it is performed only by medical practitioners and the costs can be relatively high 12in the united states the title of an embalmer is largely based on the state in which they are licensed in virginia and maryland a funeral director is someone who is licensed only to make arrangements and handle the business side of the funeral home while a mortician is licensed to do these things as well as to embalm as recently as 2015 virginia has required that funeral directors also perform 2550 embalmings as well as 2550 arrangements during their apprenticeships as a requirement for their licensing culminating in 3000 hours per apprenticeship modern practices  editinstruments used for embalming as practiced in the funeral homes of the western world notably north america embalming uses several steps modern embalming techniques are not the result of a single practitioner but rather the accumulation of many decades even centuries of research trial and error and invention a standardized version follows below but variation on techniques is very common the deceased is placed on the mortuary table in the supine anatomical position with the head elevated by a head rest the first step in embalming is to verify the permissions and requests of the family to careful plan the preparation whilst reviewing the medical certificate of death and then verify the identity of the body normally via wrist or leg tags at this point embalmers commonly perform an evaluation of the deceaseds condition noting things such as lividity rigor mortis skin condition edema swelling intravenous injection sites presence of fecal matter and by far the most important checking for signs of tissue gas the embalmer should always verify the condition of the body to create the proper care and treatment plan the embalming procedure is a surgical one requiring intensive planning evaluation and chemical selection any clothing on the body is removed and set aside and any personal effects such as jewelry are inventoried a modesty cloth is sometimes placed over the genitalia the body is washed in a germicidal soap during this process the embalmer bends flexes and massages the arms and legs to relieve rigor mortis the eyes are posed using an eye cap that keeps them shut and in the proper expression the mouth may be closed via suturing with a needle and ligature using an adhesive or by setting a wire into the maxilla and mandible with a needle injector a specialized device most commonly used in north america and unique to mortuary practice care is taken to make the expression look as relaxed and natural as possible and ideally a recent photograph of the deceased while still living is used as a reference the process of closing the mouth and eyes shaving etc is collectively known as setting the features  features may also be set after the completion of the arterial embalming process which allows the embalmer to clean and remove any purge the occurs during the embalming process tank containing embalming fluid the actual embalming process usually involves four parts arterial embalming which involves the injection of embalming chemicals into the blood vessels usually via the right common carotid artery blood and interstitial fluids are displaced by this injection and along with excess arterial solution are expelled from the right jugular vein and collectively referred to as drainage the embalming solution is injected with a centrifugal pump and the embalmer massages the body to break up circulatory clots so as to ensure the proper distribution of the embalming fluid this process of raising vessels with injection and drainage from a solitary location is known as a singlepoint injection in cases of poor circulation of the arterial solution additional injection points commonly the axillary brachial or femoral arteries with the ulnar radial and tibial vessels if necessary are used the corresponding veins are commonly also raised and utilized for drainage cases where more than one vessel is raised are referred to as multiplepoint injection with a reference to the number of vessels raised ie a sixpoint injection or sixpointer as a general rule the more points needing to be raised the greater the difficulty of the case in some cases draining from a different site from injection ie injecting arterial fluid into the right common carotid artery and draining from the right femoral vein is referred to as a split or sometimes cut injection in certain cases the embalmer may deem it necessary to perform a restricted cervical injection which involves injecting the head of the deceased separately from the rest of body this is done in cases where distention swelling has a greater chance of occurring in many cases an embalmer may select to perform what is known as a preinjection a preinjection is a solution of chemicals that do not contain any preservative chemicals but rather chemicals that allow vasodilation the focus of this pre to allow for a more complete drainage and better distribution of the arterial embalming solution cavity treatmentembalming refers to the removal of internal fluids inside body cavities via the use of an aspirator and trocar the embalmer makes a small incision just above the navel two inches superior and two inches to the right and pushes the trocar into the chest and stomach cavities to puncture the hollow organs and aspirate their contents the emblamer then fills the cavities with concentrated chemicals known as cavity chemicals that contain formaldehyde the incision is either sutured closed using a pursestring suture method or a trocar button is secured into place hypodermic embalming is a supplemental method which refers to the injection of embalming chemicals into tissue with a hypodermic needle and syringe which is generally used as needed on a case by case basis to treat areas where arterial fluid has not been successfully distributed during the main arterial injection surface embalming another supplemental method utilizes embalming chemicals to preserve and restore areas directly on the skins surface and other superficial areas as well as areas of damage such as from accident decomposition cancerous growths or skin donation it takes between three and four hours to complete a typical embalming an embalming case that requires more attention or has unexpected complications could take substantially longer the repair of an autopsy case or the restoration of a longbone donor are two such examples which generally require between seven and fourteen hours embalming is meant to temporarily preserve the body of a deceased person regardless of whether embalming is performed the type of burial or entombment and the materials used – such as wood or metal coffins and vaults – the body of the deceased will eventually decompose modern embalming is done to delay decomposition so that funeral services may take place or for the purpose of shipping the remains to a distant place for disposition a new method for embalming developed in 1992 by walter thiel uses a different set of chemicals and salts this method produces bodies with no detectable odor and much better color preservation as well as flexible limbs 13 14grooming  editrestoration tools museum of funeral customs after the body is rewashed and dried a moisturizing cream is applied to the face hands and arms the body will usually sit for as long as possible for observation by the embalmer after being dressed for visitation or funeral services cosmetics are applied to make the body appear more lifelike and to create a memory picture for the deceaseds friends and relatives for babies who have died the embalmer may apply a light cosmetic massage cream after embalming to provide a natural appearance massage cream is also used on the face to prevent them from dehydrating and the infants mouth is often kept slightly open for a more natural expression if possible the funeral director uses a light translucent cosmetic sometimes heavier opaque cosmetics are used to hide bruises cuts or discolored areas makeup is applied to the lips to mimic their natural color sometimes a very pale or light pink lipstick is applied on males while brighter colored lipstick is applied to females hair gels or baby oil is applied to style short hair while hairspray is applied to style longer hair powders especially baby powder are applied to the body to eliminate odors and it is also applied to the face to achieve a matte and fresh effect to prevent oiliness of the corpse mortuary cosmetizing is not done for the same reason as makeup for living people rather it is designed to add depth and dimension to a persons features that lack of blood circulation has removed warm areas – where blood vessels in living people are superficial such as the cheeks chin and knuckles – have subtle reds added to recreate this effect while browns are added to the palpabrae eyelids to add depth especially important as viewing in a coffin creates an unusual perspective rarely seen in everyday life during the viewing pinkcolored lighting is sometimes used near the body to lend a warmer tone to the deceaseds complexion a photograph of the deceased in good health is often sought to guide the embalmers hand in restoring the body to a more lifelike appearance blemishes and discolorations such as bruises in which the discoloration is not in the circulatory system and cannot be removed by arterial injection occasioned by the last illness the settling of blood or the embalming process itself are also dealt with at this time although some embalmers utilize hypodermic bleaching agents such as phenolbased cauterants during injection to lighten discoloration and allow easier cosmetizing it is also common for the embalmer to perform minor restoration of the deceaseds appearance with tissue building chemicals and a hypodermic syringe tissue building chemicals tissue builders become solid with the introduction of liquids such as water or interstitial fluids commonly the area where the spheoid and temporal bones meet this can also be referred to the temples in the event of trauma or natural depressions on the face or hands tissue builder is also used to return those regions of the face to the expectations of the family this process is normally only completed with consent of the family however it may vary based on regional regulation and law clothing  editin the western world men are typically buried in business attire such as a suit or coat and tie and women in semiformal dresses or pant suits in recent years a change has occurred and many individuals are now buried in less formal clothing such as what they would have worn on a daily basis or other favorite attire the clothing used can also reflect the deceased persons profession or vocation priests and ministers are often dressed in their liturgical vestments and military and law enforcement personnel often wear their uniform underwear singlets bras briefs and hosiery are all used if the family so desires and the deceased is dressed in them as they would be in life in certain instances a funeral director will request a specific style of clothing such as a collared shirt or blouse to cover traumatic marks or autopsy incisions in other cases clothing may be cut down the back and placed on the deceased from the front to ensure a proper fit this is done for example when the rigid state of the deceased makes it impossible to bend the arms to place them through the sleeves in clothing in many areas of asia and europe the custom of dressing the body in a specially designed shroud or funeral gown rather than in clothing used by the living is preferred after the deceased has been dressed they are placed in the coffin or casket in american english the word coffin is used to refer to an anthropoid stretched hexagonal form whereas casket refers to a rectangular box no such distinction is made in commonwealth english where coffin is the preferred term and casket can be used interchangeably it is common for photographs notes cards and favourite personal items to be placed in the coffin with the deceased bulky and expensive items such as electric guitars are occasionally interred with a body in some ways this mirrors the ancient practice of placing grave goods with a person for their use or enjoyment in the afterlife in traditional chinese culture paper substitutes of the goods are buried or cremated with the deceased instead as well as paper money specifically purchased for the occasion chemicals  editmain article embalming chemicals embalming chemicals are a variety of preservatives sanitizers disinfectant agents and additives used in modern embalming to temporarily delay decomposition and restore a natural appearance for viewing a body after death a mixture of these chemicals is known as embalming fluid and is used to preserve deceased individuals sometimes only until the funeral other times indefinitely typical embalming fluid contains a mixture of formaldehyde glutaraldehyde methanol humectants and wetting agents and other solvents that can be used the formaldehyde content generally ranges from 5 to 35 percent and the ethanol content may range from 9 to 56 percent environmentalists generally disapprove of embalming because of the harmful chemicals involved and their interactions with the environment recently more ecofriendly embalming methods have become available 15specialist embalming  editbadly decomposing bodies trauma cases frozen or drowned bodies and those to be transported over long distances also require special treatment beyond that for the normal case the restoration of bodies and features damaged by accident or disease is commonly called restorative art or demisurgery and all qualified embalmers have some degree of training and practice in it for such cases the benefit of embalming is startlingly apparent in contrast though many people have unreasonable expectations of what a dead body should look like due to the unrealistic portrayal of dead bodies usually by live actors in movies and television shows  according to whom viewers generally have an unrealistic expectation that a body undergoing decomposition should look as it did before death ironically the work of a skilled embalmer often results in the deceased appearing natural enough that the embalmer appears to have done nothing at all normally a better result can be achieved when a photograph and the decedents regular makeup if worn are available to help make the deceased appear more as they did when alive embalming autopsy cases differs from standard embalming because the nature of the postmortem examination irrevocably disrupts the circulatory system due to the removal of the organs and viscera in these cases a sixpoint injection is made through the two iliac or femoral arteries subclavian or axillary vessels and common carotids with the viscera treated separately with cavity fluid or a special embalming powder in a viscera bag shake and bake the treatment of autopsied viscera vary on the regulation and laws of the region many regions require the viscera to be further dissected in the form of one inch by one inch treated in cavity fluid until well fixed persevered drained of cavity fluid and placed in the thoracic and abdominal cavities in alternating layers of an embalming compound known as harding compoundand viscera in many morgues in the united states canada and new zealand the necessary vessels are carefully preserved during the autopsy  citation needed in countries where embalming is less common such as australia  citation needed and japan  citation needed they are routinely excised longterm preservation requires different techniques such as using stronger preservatives and multiple injection sites to ensure thorough saturation of body tissues for anatomy education  edita rather different process is used for cadavers embalmed for dissection by medical professionals students and researchers here the first priority is for long term preservation not presentation as such medical embalmers use anatomical wetting fluids that contain concentrated formaldehyde 37–40 known as formalin or gluteraldehyde as well as phenol and are made without dyes or perfumes many embalming chemical companies make specialized anatomical embalming fluids anatomical embalming is performed into a closed circulatory system the fluid is usually injected with an embalming machine into an artery under high pressure and flow and allowed to swell and saturate the tissues after the deceased is left to sit for a number of hours the venous system is generally opened and the fluid allowed to drain out although many anatomical embalmers do not use any drainage technique anatomical embalmers may choose to use gravityfeed embalming where the container dispensing the embalming fluid is elevated above the bodys level and fluid is slowly introduced over an extended time sometimes as long as several days unlike standard arterial embalming no drainage occurs and the body distends extensively with fluid the distension eventually reduces often under extended up to six months refrigeration leaving a fairly normal appearance there is no separate cavity treatment of the internal organs anatomically embalmed cadavers have a typically uniform grey colouration due both to the high formaldehyde concentration mixed with the blood and to the lack of red colouration agents commonly added to standard nonmedical embalming fluids formaldehyde mixed with blood causes the grey discoloration also known as formaldehyde grey or embalmers grey religious practices  editthere is much difference of opinion among different faiths as to the permissibility of embalming a brief overview of some of the larger faiths positions are examined below most branches of the christian faith generally allow embalming some bodies within eastern orthodoxy profess an absolute ban against embalming except when required by law or other necessity 16 while others may discourage but do not prohibit it 17 in general the decision on embalming is one that is dictated by the personal preference of the family rather than a specific church policy the church of jesus christ of latterday saints does not discourage or prohibit embalming often due to the custom of church members dressing the deceased embalming is given preference members of iglesia ni cristo allows embalming for the view of their loved ones it forbids autopsy and cremation because they believe the body of the deceased is sacred and should be cared for with respect they dress and groom the deceased as they looked in life the preferred method is arterial embalming in which formaldehyde is injected into the body some neopagans generally discourage embalming believing it unnatural to disrupt the physical recycling of the body to the earth they encourage the use of green graveyards where the body is placed in a biodegradable coffin and buried under a tree instead of a tombstone this belief is based on the fact that embalmed corpses leach harmful chemicals in the soil members of the baháí faith are not embalmed instead the body is washed and then placed in a cotton linen or silk shroud the body is to be buried within one hours journey from the place of death if this is feasible cremation is also forbidden zoroastrians traditionally hold a type of sky burial within a structure known as a tower of silence in which the body is exposed to weathering and predation to dispose of the remains and thus embalming the body is contrary to their funeral designs this is due to the zoroastrian belief that the dead body is unclean and the pure elements of earth and fire should not be allowed to come into contact with it this practice was declared illegal in iran by the government of the last shah and iranian zoroastrians have turned to burials in concrete chambers which allow no contact between corpse and soil zoroastrians in india who are known locally as parsis continue to use the tower of silence traditional jewish law forbids embalming or cremation and burial is to be done as soon as possible – preferably within 24 hours however under certain circumstances burial may be delayed if it is impossible to bury a person immediately or to permit the deceased to be buried in israel guidance of a rabbi or the local chevra kadisha jewish burial society should be sought regarding any questions as particular circumstances may justify leniencies notably the biblical joseph was according to the  genesis 5026 embalmed in the egyptian fashion as was his father israel jacob genesis 502 the chevra kadisha ensures the body is guarded except during the sabbath typically these shomrim guards recite psalms within earshot of the deceased the deceased is dressed in a kittel —a white robelike garment and then in a white linen shroud burial in israel is done without a coffin outside israel coffins may be used if required by local custom or law but it must be a simple coffin made without nails or glue so as to permit natural processes to process the corpse embalming is not practiced by muslims before they bury their deceased they are urged to bury their deceased as soon as possible as a form of honoring them in their view the body is washed usually by the spouse or a close relative of the same gender he or she is then dressed in a clean perfumed plain white burial shroud called kafan people gather to hold a joint prayer for the dead called salat aljanaza they do not use coffins instead the 2 meterdeep grave has edging approximately 1 meter down and a slab is used to cover the grave which is covered afterwards with loose dirt notable embalmings  editthis

the 20th century is that of vladimir lenin 18 which continues to draw crowds decades after his death in 1924 and is seen in his moscow mausoleum joseph stalin was also embalmed and placed next to lenin but his body was buried in 1961 during destalinization klement gottwald of czechoslovakia who died just five days after attending stalin s funeral was embalmed and displayed in a mausoleum at national monument in vitkov in prague however in 1962 due to a botched embalming the body was decomposing and was removed and cremated bulgarian georgi dimitrov was embalmed and placed on display in the sofia georgi dimitrov mausoleum after the fall of communism in bulgaria his body was buried in 1990 in the central cemetery of sofia mongolias khorloogiin choibalsan angolas agostinho neto and guyanas forbes burnham were also embalmed by the same russian team 19 currently embalmed communist leaders can also be found in the mausoleum of mao zedong the ho chi minh mausoleum and the kumsusan palace of the sun for kim ilsung and kim jongil the botched embalming of pope pius xii 1876–1958 pope 1939–1958 by a charlatan doctor—which only sped up the rate of decomposition—led to his body turning black and his nose falling off while lying in state and the body disintegrated in the coffin the swiss guards stationed around pius xiis body were forced to change shifts every ten to fifteen minutes since the bodys odor caused some guards to pass out the doctor who performed the embalming had also taken photos of the pontiff in his death throes intending to sell them to tabloids the italian tabloids refused to buy the photos and the doctor was banned from entering the vatican citystate by john xxiii who furthermore prohibited any photography of a deceased pope until the body is properly vested and laid out charles xii 1682–1718 is one of several swedish kings to have been embalmed when charles xiis sarcophagus was opened in 1917 his features were still recognizable almost
