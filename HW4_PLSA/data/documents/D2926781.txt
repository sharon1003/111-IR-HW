dining out united states other  us dining out should you tip at buffet restaurants do you think one should tip at a buffet style restaurant im talking about one where the hostess seats you and brings drinks but you get your own food from a buffet if you think that one should tip how much  do you think is acceptable thanks update ok please let me add here do you think that restaurants like this should just put the beverages out for you to also serve yourself and do with less attendants1 following 18 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer ive been a waitress for 25 years and this is a pet peeve of mine tipping has gotten out of hand in our society it seems like every profession has decided to include tips to supplement their incomes tipping was instituted to be a form of commission for full service employees it enables businesses in the service industry to keep costs low by passing on the service part of the cost to the customer i briefly worked as a buffet server and i did appreciate the tips but at the same time i always felt like i wasnt giving the service that required a tip i take my career choice seriously and i always give the best service possible my job entails anticipating needs prompt friendly service professional attitude food preparation cashier advisor cleaning menu knowledge hostess bartender the list goes on and on in return i do feel i should be compensated for doing all these things and doing them well a buffet really doesnt require the above mentioned skills and therefore i do not feel it is mandatory to tip yes i do believe the beverages should be self service and that would eliminate the only real requirements of the server these establishments have bussers and they can easily clear the table and bring more plates if necessary people dont want to tip properly nowadays because they are getting fed up with tipping every employee of every business they deal with tipping hair stylists delivery people and full service employees is acceptable in my opinion and everything else is nonsense having said that i still tip around 300 to 500 when dining in such establishments because i realize the owners have chosen to pay their waitstaff below minimum wagebulldog · 9 years ago3 0 comment askers rating i have worked in the resteraunt buisness in the past and have waitressed so i know what low wages they make outside of tips so i would say yes but i say yes with an exception at a buffet where it is a restaraunt with a buffet in it such as ponderosa where you have a waitress who is the only waitress you have and who gets you refills and would bring you a steak or dish if ordered you should tip even if you only got buffet you should tip because those waitresses are workin for a small wage with tips to supplement so every tip helps it really adds up but when you are somewhere that they only clear the table and you get everything yourself you dont need to tip these workers are making atleast minimum wage unless you want to usually they have a few people workin in the dining are and it is hard to tell who would get the tipapriled02 · 9 years ago0 0 comment yes you should tip a server at a buffet restaurant usually does more work than a server at a sit down restaurant servers do not make more than 3 an hour unless they have been at the same place for years servers get a 35 cent raise a year everyone should tip about 18 now it hasnt been 10 in about 10 years servers work hard and although i hate that servers are dependent on tips for money thats how it is if you cant tip or are to cheap cook at home or eat at fast food oh and the average tip is about 2250 per person not a dollar source s i have been a server at both types of restaurants amanda · 9 years ago2 4 comment yes  definitely tip that is how they make their money tip on the average of 15  maybe a little more or less depending on the service they do have to come back and fourth and clean off the table pick up the used plates and offer drinks i actually do know of a buffet style restaurant that you actually go up and fix your own drinks including icee style drinks  its siciliys buffett amy a · 9 years ago0 0 comment you are not allowed to serve your own drinks because you may get sick i think you should tip at least 15 im a little biased as that i used to be a waitress at a buffett resturant its still hard work carrying plates refilling drinks and making sure everyone is happy we made only 213 an hour and were taxed on that you can make a lot of money but you work hard too source sexperience i think everyone should wait on tables at least once in lifetimekatie · 9 years ago0 0 comment of course the server is cleaning up after you between trips to the buffet and getting your beverages for you as well fifteen percent is acceptable one has to keep in mind that most restaurant servers in this country earn about half of the federal minimum hourly wage sacha · 9 years ago0 0 comment i dont believe i should have to tip as i get my own drink at my buffet and i never ask the waitress for anything jodie31 · 3 years ago2 0 comment to the first question yes i believe you should tip normally i just tip about 24 for the table depending on the service yes i do think that they should allow people to serve themselves drinks however i believe that they do this as some sort of way of justifying a higher price emily a · 9 years ago0 1 comment i think about 10 is good a lot of those people make about as much money per hour as servers around 3 or so and still refill your drinks clear your plates wipe your table roll silverware etc if you are eating 4 plates of food for just 8 you can afford to throw down a buck or twodavya85 · 9 years ago0 2 1 comment yes definitely just because you go back and forth and get your own plates of food does not exclude the waitress she or he still brings your drinks usually offers extras as well as getting anything additional you need i feel at least 10 percent
