is absinthe strong in alcohol absinthe contains a lot more alcohol than most other liquors actual content varies by brand but many absinthes are nearly twice as alcoholic as say scotch gin or vodka to put it another way a shot of strong absinthe roughly equals two shots of whisky or similar spirit for easy reference here is an example of alcohol content in a few of the betterknown brands typical whisky gin or vodka 40 alcohol absinthe kubler 53 alcohol pernod absinthe 60 alcohol la fee absinthe 68 alcohol hills absinth 70 alcohol king of spirits absinth 70 alcohol do drink responsibly unexpected overindulgence is a genuine possibility with absinthe especially for newcomers who assume the drink compares to other spirits in alcohol strength recently an english aristocrat claimed that absinthe sent him doolally mad in his defense against a drinkdriving charge it transpired the man had spent some hours in the company of the green fairy  as absinthe is known a fact he later used to explain the unusually high level of intoxication he was apparently under when stopped by the cops putting the blame on the fairy’s secondary presumably thujoneinduced effects must have seen a convenient excuse the fact remains however that the man admitted having drunk three or four absinthes that afternoon  and that in alcohol content equals some six to eight glasses of scotch with absinthes popularity on the rise again many other anecdotes of inadvertent overindulgence are being told  and newcomers to absinthe are not the only ones at risk most seasoned absintheurs also admit to having indulged a little too much at least once or twiceas far as alcohol intake goes the fairy turns out to be a deceptive little devil says ben romano a retired american professor who lives in the south of france consider the thirst of a hot summer afternoon would you down a triple whisky unlikely now how about a cool smooth creamy absintheice water louche oh sure its easy to have one too many it tastes good you know loucheing absinthe with iced water does have the desired effect of diluting the strong green liquor and apparently this is how absinthe should be drunk anyway to connoisseurs the ritual of la louche is an essential part of the absinthe experience drinking absinthe neat is something akin to a crime but however you drink your absinthe moderation is the key someone with the idea to get drunk smashed pieeyed or whatever you wish to call it will do so  with or without absinthe so long as you remain mindful of absinthe alcohol potency the green fairy will prove the most pleasant of companions in sensible quantities she will reward you with a delightfully openminded clearheaded inebriation which no other beverage can match alcohol yes but theres more to it with absinthe the effects of alcohol are countered by the stimulants present in the herbs from which the emerald liquor is made as a result absintheinduced inebriation is quite different to the usual blearyeyed incoherence that comes from drinking too much vin de plonk or spirits frank kelly rich a writer noted his experience of drinking absinthei had long used a burgundywhiskycoffee combination to help me write alcohol for inspiration coffee for structure and here was the whole shebang in one compact package rich continuedafter my tenth glass i sat down to write and thats when i got a grip on what that difference was i was drunk yes but not whisky or wine drunk i was drunk and clearheaded i discovered i could write with a strange sense of cognizance when i should have been scratching unintelligible ravings on bar napkins the alcohol wave was rolling through me but instead of drowning i was somehow above it coolly observing so there you have it one of strongest alcoholic drinks ever made but one that apparently keeps you alert despite its abundant alcohol content got something to say about absinthes strength effects alcohol content at absinthe fever we encourage you
