12 march 2013  0659 pmhaving the ability to enable drls would be nice cant understand fords reasoning for not enabling it any thing that makes the car safer and more visible is worth having in my

could get the threshold that turns on the auto lights modified so they come on in brighter conditions than they do now yes that would be a really good compromise being able to set the threshold when the lights come on regarding the drl i think i read this on the bof but it appears to be possible since a few people already did this not sure if the price some guys paid is worth it according to some accounts it takes 5 minutes and the dealer charged at 60 for it you should be able to find the reference on bof one guy also had contact information from his service advisor in there2013 ford fusion

would consume also it would be great to find a service bulletin that explains how to turn them on so that those with reluctant dealers can show them how it is done overall if this is just a software

edge selposted 27 august 2013  0950 ami made an appointment for a variety of things for tomorrow and another shot at drl activation is on my list it is going back for a check engine light issue that is some vacuum control valve sticking cant remember the name the test they run to cycle all those valves takes around 30 minutes and they ran it twice to make sure last week when i was chatting with the technician and the service manager about things the service manager said hey didnt we try drl already once for you yep but you know the forums which gets a chuckle and an eye roll all friendly the tech chimed in and said i cant believe we cant do it i havent tried a 13 fusion yet but there has to be a way my reply the other tech said the setting was grayed out or not there the first time i cant remember which techs reply  yeah maybe but there are like 5 software updates to our control computers a day so it probably changed if it is there ill find it for you he is also going to check and see if there is an adjustment to the autoheadlights while i think they turn on earlier after the pcm update was done i still wish it was earlier still my other issues to resolve are a mft update that syncmyridecom says i need the dealer to do i already did the 362 myself and a hopeful flash of the software controlling the windows to resolve my random failure on autoup auto down works fine they have it for the whole afternoon so my fingers are crossed that all of the punch list items get donehybridbear likes this2017 fusion energi ti ruby red other cars in the ford garage2014 ford edge

drls are just a software setting on that one as well the drls are only for the headlamps from what i understand i want the led strip that is located under each headlight not the led headlamps themselves to be fully on during the day as well as at night normal op there is no pcm like in the ffh and mkz in the sport trac so no it cant be programmed to turn on drls the drls on the 2002 require a physical switch on the headlamp switch wiring and the drl module none of which came on mine edited by steve btx 27 august 2013  0250 pmhybridbear likes this white platinum metallic tricoat
