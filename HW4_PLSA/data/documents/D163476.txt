foraging sumac edible wild plant having grown up in a climate completely different than the one i live in now and having only really taken up foraging seriously lately as in the past year or two there arent many things that i forage now that i foraged growing up sumac though is one of the exceptions we used to go to six flags amusement park on a semi regular basis with my family as a kid while waiting on line for the roller coasters i remember my mother pointing out sumac trees growing on the other side of the fence shed reach over and pick some sumac clusters and wed suck them puckering our lips at their sourness while waiting for our turn on the ride we didnt just eat sumac at the amusement park though my mother actually purchased sumac as a spice from the grocery store and shed use it to make a delicious chicken with onions hold on a second i can hear you asking isnt sumac poisonous why are you telling us to eat it yes and no its a case of mistaken identity or rather cousins poison sumac poison ivy and poison oak are all related to edible sumac but edible sumac is another plant entirely looks very different and is very much edible it has been used for culinary and medicinal purposes by natives of the regions in which they grow for thousands of years speaking of which edible sumac doesnt grow all over the world but it grows in north america europe the mediterranean basin and the middle east and possibly other areas but i dont know for certain sumac rhus in latin is a close relative of the pistachio and the cashew staghorn sumac from hungerand thirst for life blog the sumac variety that grows near me is tanners sumac  rhus cariara  so the majority of the pictures in this post will be of that variety but the edible varieties growing in the us are staghorn sumac rhus typhina smooth sumac rhus glabra  fragrant sumac rhus aromatica desertlittleleaf sumac rhus microphylla lemonade sumac rhus integrifolia sugar sumac  rhus ovata and possibly some others the common trait that the edible sumac plants have that distinguishes them from poison sumac is this edible sumac has reddish brownish or purplish berries which are edible poison sumacs berries are white i bolded that and will repeat that point to make it clear red sumac is edible white sumac is poison with that difference in mind let us proceed so how do you identify sumac well while i cant say this is true for every variety of sumac this is what my local sumac and many others look like sumac is a bush or a short tree usually with branches growing in all different directions they have branches with little leavesleaflets on each side of the branch growing in pairs with one leaf slightly above the other at the end of each branch is a leaf growing perpendicular to the other leaves each leaf is notched so the edges look zigzagged but the main identifying characteristic of sumac is its red maroon magenta or brown fruit called drupes that grow in clusters on the branches in my opinion these clusters look not unlike upside down clusters of grapes each of these drupes have a hard seed in the middle which is what drupe really means fleshy fruit around a hard seed the drupes of my local sumac are each roughly a drop larger than the size of a peppercorn and each cluster is between 3 and 6 inches tall but other varieties of sumac have slightly larger drupes and much larger clusters when ripe the drupes are somewhat wet and sticky most varieties of sumac have fuzzy fruit but the smooth sumacs fruit are smooth hence the name smooth sumac the berries tend to be ripe in the summer sumac being a good source of vitamin c imparts a very sour lemony taste to dishes sumac is typically dried ground and sold as a spice especially in middle eastern markets you can also buy sumac on amazoncom  sumac is used in the middle eastern spice mix called zaatar together with herbs often hyssop but sometimes other herbs sesame seeds and salt to make a really delicious spice mix often eaten with pita bread there are many other dishes that can be made with sumac as well kebabs are often made with sumac as is fish rice chicken and many other dishes ive seen an onion and sumac salad  looking something like this  being served as a condiment in felafel shops ive made a terrific chicken called musakhan that is made with sumac my friend butter even makes her applesauce with sumac many people make drinks with sumac so many sumac recipes out there some delicious foods ive made with sumac the question is how do you start with what you have on the tree and end up with a spice usable for cooking i have to thank butter for cluing me in on how to do this 1 to make sumac spice you first lay your sumac out to dry i lay mine out on newspaper that i put in a box which i left open so it had good access to air every few days i mix around the sumac so that the whole thing dries 2 once the berry clusters are dry either all the way or somewhat stick the whole cluster into a food processor but remove all leaves first3 process for a few minutes this will break apart the fruit of the sumac chopping it up but leaving the seeds intact 4 put the sumac into a mesh strainer and sift this is the sumac spice that i sifted out and now use in my recipes if i wanted to i could have ground it further in my coffee grinder but i see no reason to do so this is what remained behind in my strainer after sifting i stick this back in my food processor and repeat steps 3 and 4 until i get out as much of the sumac spice as i can what remains behind i set aside for use in another recipe which ill write about tomorrow apparently according to a survival video i watched you can roast and grind the sumac seeds and eat them but ive never tried it myself sumac berries can also be used as a dye sumac delicious so glad i was able to find it growing locally why dont you go out and go look for some sumac today p s one note of caution while sumac is not poisonous there are some people who are allergic to sumac as a spice so be cautious the first time you use it making sure that you arent sensitive to this spice p p s if youd like to read about how sumac can be used medicinally read some more here have you ever eaten anything with sumac before if so what was the dish made with sumac have you ever cooked with sumac or seen sumac being sold as a spice ever seen sumac growing wild and foraged it would you feel comfortable foraging sumac after this description or does the fact that a poison sumac exist make you wary of foraging it even with the reassurances that poison sumac has white berries and edible sumac has redbrown berries linking up to monday mania homestead barn hop allergy free wednesday  real food wednesday posted by penniless parenting at 417 pm email this blog
