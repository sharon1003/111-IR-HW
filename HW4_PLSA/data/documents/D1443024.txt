allowed them to either go outside or on newspaper placed at the door that led to the outside you may prefer to use potty training pads rather than newspaperi only used newspaper for a short period of time and only when the puppy was very young over a period of time i moved the newspaper from just inside the door to just outside the door and then i completely removed the newspaper altogether if you

intensive time potty training your puppy know the signs that your puppy is about to eliminate puppies are quick one minute they are playing and the next minute they are peeing on your carpet some of the signs that your pup is about to pee are sniffing the floor circling whimpering taking off suddenly to another room or area they often do this when they want to poop often there are no warning signs the puppy just squats and pees give your puppy the right message when you notice your puppy doing any of the above things gently and without a big fuss pick him up and place him on the newspaper or take him outside dont frighten the pup when you do this its a fact of life that your puppy has to pee and he has to poop so you dont want him to get the wrong message that peeing and pooping are wrong you want him to get the message that peeing and pooping in the wrong place is not acceptable behavior and pottying in the allowed area is acceptable behavior catching puppy in the act when you catch your puppy in the act of going to the bathroom in the wrong place tell him firmly in a not happy voice nooooo dont pee there then take him to the newspaper or take him outside if you shout and carry on at him it will only frighten him and he will soon learn to sneak off and do it where you cant see him your puppy may have already started to pee by the time you reach him and although you may have dribbles across the floor still take him to the newspaper or outside and then praise him for being there sometimes you are not quick enough and he has finished peeing by the time you reach him never mind take him to the paper or outside anyway and tell him do a pee here good boy clever dog  dont ever make the newspaper something to be frightened of it helps to put some dog pee on the newspaper because the pup will identify the smell and associate it with going to the bathroom when your puppy has an accident blot a little of the urine on to the newspaper somewhere in his brain he might think hmmm pee smell here i think this would be a good place to pee and so he pees on the newspaper when your pup goes to the newspaper or outside of his own free will wait until he starts to eliminate and then as he is doing it tell him in a happy voice what great fellow he is what a good boy do a pee on the paper good work well doneexpect accidents dont have unrealistic expectations of your puppy he is going to have plenty of accidents before he gets the message of what is expected of him praise not punish praising your dog for doing the right thing will always work far better than punishing him for doing the wrong thing dont get angry dont go overboard by yelling and screaming teach your dog by positive means instead of negative reactions cleaning up is very important when your puppy pees or poops on the carpet or floor you must clean it up immediately if your puppy smells pee on the floor or carpet then he is more likely to return to this area to pee again in addition to all other information on this page you must clean all odors of previous accidents so as to prevent him reoffending in the same spot a dog relies very much on his sense of smell on hard floor areas such as tiles or wood this is not a great problem wipe up the pee or poop with some paper towels and then use some disinfectant if your puppy pees or poops on the carpet use an oxy action laundry stain spray to get rid of the odors image at left is just an example any laundry spray that uses oxy action is suitable below are two links which give detailed descriptions of how to effectively clean up dog urine and poop using household products that you probably have on hand how to remove dog urine odors from carpets using household products how to clean up dog poop stains and odors from your carpet too late hes already done it accept some of the blame yourself perhaps you could have been watching him better dont get angry if you find the mess or puddle after the event has happened do not rub his nose in it this is a big no no and such an old fashioned idea that doesnt work however you must let him know that this is unacceptable put your dog on his leash or in the case of a small puppy pick him up and take him to the puddle or mess change the tone of your voice adopt a not happy voice and say im not happy with this while pointing to the puddle or poop make him look at the accident it is very likely that your pup will not want to look at what you are pointing to and he will avert his eyes from what you are showing him hold him there and tell him several times in a not happy voice no not good he will feel uncomfortable when you do this and this is what you want to achieve have some tissue at the ready and pick up the poop or blot the urine and take it outside and put it where you would have liked him to do it in the first place make sure you still have him on the leash and that he accompanies you and watches every step of the procedure put the tissue on the ground and then tell the puppy in a happy voice good place do pee here very good place or words to that effect i still keep finding little surprises on the floor if you are constantly finding puddles and messes follow the above procedure with one small change when you take him to the puddle or poop and he averts his eyes and doesnt want to know anything about it tie his leash to something nearby such as a table leg or chair leg make sure he cant escape seeing it leave him like this for a few minutes while you walk away and ignore him dont leave him there for more than five minutes thats long enough to get the message across when you are not there you cant always be with your puppy 24 hours a day when you go out you have the choice of putting him outside or containing him to one room or area in some very cold climates putting your puppy outside is not an option you could for example put him in the garage with a warm kennel or bed if your house is open plan you may have to come up with some idea of barricading off a containment area baby gates often work well choose an area that can be easily cleaned after accidents put newspapers in the room with him near the door some people choose to contain their dog or puppy in the basement when they are away from home before you consider this option ask yourself if you would be happy to be locked in your basement for several hours is it cold and damp how could you improve the conditions of the basement is it possible to provide heating a snug bed would be the absolute minimum requirement dont shut him up in a pen or a small bathroom thats not going to teach him anything dont put him in a crate crates teach dogs nothing they are imprisoned and have no choices imagine if you really needed to pee and you were locked in a small cage how long could you hold it could you hold it for 5 hours until someone got home i doubt it now imagine your puppy is a small child locked in a cage could a toddler hold it for 5 hours you cant expect your puppy to hold it for hours on end you should expect that there will be pee or poop on the floor when you get home just make it easier for yourself to clean up by containing him to an area that is easier to clean for example choose an area that is tiled hardwood or concrete as your dog gets older he will have more control over his bladder and bowels but when he is a baby you cannot expect miracles how long does it take to potty train a puppy on average it will take about two to three weeks remember that all dogs are not the same and some will learn very quickly and some will take a little longer i once had a dog who learned paper training after one day i caught her in the act and put her on the newspaper and she never again went anywhere else apart from the newspaper or outside she was a very smart puppy and an exception to the rule expect regression sometimes months after you think you have successfully potty trained your dog he will have the odd slip up expect this and deal with it as you did in the beginning accidents may happen with fully trained dogs dogs that are not neutered or spayed have a higher incidence of eliminating in the house scent marking is another form of undesired elimination and can be managed by neutering and refreshing housetraining if scent marking is a problem there is further reading here prevent urine marking inside the house
