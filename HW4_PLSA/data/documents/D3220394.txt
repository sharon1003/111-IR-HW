graduate and research institution providing instruction in the sciences mathematics and engineering 1 local citizens supported the idea voting the same year to transfer to the university 59 acres 24 ha of mesa land on the coast near the preexisting scripps institution of oceanography the regents requested an additional gift of 550 acres 220 ha of undeveloped mesa land northeast of scripps as well as 500 acres 200 ha on the former site of camp matthews from the federal government but roger revelle then director of scripps institution and main advocate for establishing the new campus jeopardized the site selection by exposing the la jolla communitys exclusive real estate business practices which were antagonistic to minority racial and religious groups this outraged local conservatives as well as regent edwin w pauley 1 uc president clark kerr satisfied san diego city donors by changing the proposed name from university of california la jolla to university of california san diego 3 1 the city voted in agreement to its part in 1958 and the uc approved construction of the new campus in 1960 because of the clash with pauley revelle was not made chancellor herbert york first director of lawrence livermore national laboratory was designated instead 1 york planned the main campus according to the  oxbridge  model relying on many of revelles ideas 33uc san diego was the first general campus of the university of california to be designed from the top down in terms of research emphasis local leaders disagreed on whether the new school should be a technical research institute or a more broadly based school that included undergraduates as well john jay hopkins of general dynamics corporation pledged one million dollars for the former while the city council offered free land for the latter 33 34 the original authorization for the san diego campus given by the uc regents in 1956 approved a graduate program in science and technology that included undergraduate programs a compromise that won both the support of general dynamics and the city voters approval 33 nobel laureate harold urey a physicist from the university of chicago and hans suess who had published the first paper on the greenhouse effect with revelle in the previous year were early recruits to the faculty in 1958 34maria goeppertmayer later the second female nobel laureate in physics was appointed professor of physics in 1960 34 the graduate division of the school opened in 1960 with 20 faculty in residence with instruction offered in the fields of physics biology chemistry and earth science before the main campus completed construction classes were held in the scripps institution of oceanography 33by 1963 new facilities on the mesa had been finished for the school of science and engineering and new buildings were under construction for social sciences and humanities ten additional faculty in those disciplines were hired and the whole site was designated the first college later renamed after roger revelle of the new campus york resigned as chancellor that year and was replaced by john semple galbraith 34 the undergraduate program accepted its first class of 181 freshman at revelle college in 1964 33 35 second college was founded in 1964 on the land deeded by the federal government and named after environmentalist john muir two years later 36 the school of medicine also accepted its first students in 1966 34political theorist herbert marcuse joined the faculty in 1965 a champion of the new left he reportedly was the first protestor to occupy the administration building in a demonstration organized by his student political activist angela davis 37 the american legion offered to buy out the remainder of marcuses contract for 20000 the regents censured chancellor mc gill for defending marcuse on the basis of academic freedom but further action was averted after local leaders expressed support for marcuse 34 further student unrest was felt at the university as the united states increased its involvement in the vietnam war during the early 1960s when a student raised a viet minh flag over the campus 33 protests escalated as the war continued and were only exacerbated after the national guard fired on student protesters at kent state university in 1970 over 200 students occupied urey hall with one student setting himself on fire in protest of the war 33 38early research activity and faculty quality notably in the sciences was integral to shaping the focus and culture of the university even before uc san diego had its own campus faculty recruits had already made significant research breakthroughs such as the keeling curve a graph that plots rapidly increasing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and was the first significant evidence for global climate change the kohn–sham equations used to investigate particular atoms and molecules in quantum chemistry and the miller–urey experiment which gave birth to the field of prebiotic chemistry 39 40 41 engineering particularly computer science became an important part of the universitys academics as it matured university researchers helped develop ucsd pascal an early machineindependent programming language that later heavily influenced java 42 43 44 45 the national science foundation network a precursor to the internet and the network news transfer protocol during the late 1970s to 1980s 46 in economics the methods for analyzing economic time series with timevarying volatility  arch  and with common trends  cointegration were developed uc san diego maintained its research intense character after its founding racking up 25 nobel laureates affiliated within 50 years of history a rate of four per decade under richard c atkinson s leadership as chancellor from 1980 to 1995 the university strengthened its ties with the city of san diego by encouraging technology transfer with developing companies transforming san diego into a world leader in technologybased industries he oversaw a rapid expansion of the school of engineering later renamed after qualcomm founder irwin m jacobs with the construction of the san diego supercomputer center 47 and establishment of the computer science electrical engineering and bioengineering departments 48 private donations increased from 15 million to nearly 50 million annually faculty expanded by nearly 50 and enrollment doubled to about 18000 students during his administration by the end of his chancellorship the quality of uc san diego graduate programs was ranked 10th in the nation by the national research council 49the university continued to undergo further expansion during the first decade of the new millennium with the establishment and construction of two new professional schools — the skaggs school of pharmacy and rady school of management —and the california institute for telecommunications and information technology a research institute run jointly with uc irvine uc san diego also reached two financial milestones during this time becoming the first university in the western region to raise over 1 billion in its eightyear fundraising campaign in 2007 50 and also obtaining an additional 1 billion through research contracts and grants in a single fiscal year for the first time in 2010 3 despite this due to the california budget crisis the university loaned 40 million against its own assets in 2009 to offset a significant reduction in state educational appropriations 51 the salary of pradeep khosla who became chancellor in 2012 has been the subject of controversy
