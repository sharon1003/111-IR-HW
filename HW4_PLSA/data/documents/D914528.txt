foods to help toddlers sleep by lilian presti 0 comment toddler years are very busy for both children and their parents this period of continuous exploration and intense movement also requires proper downtime and rest ample sleep is critical as during this period the body does much of its building and repair work toddlers should be averaging somewhere between 1214 hours of sleep within a 24hour period yet today many toddlers struggle with sleep issues either not being able to fall asleep quickly or not remaining in a deep sleep state for long enough although diet is not the only cause for sleep issues it can certainly play a large role in determining the quality of slumber a child gets proper preparation to prepare a toddler for sleep it is important to calm the brain by stimulating the proper secretions of specific neurotransmitters in particular the neurotransmitter serotonin should be activated as serotonin brings on the feelings of satiety happiness and sleepiness therefore it is serotonin that we want to increase as we approach bedtime since serotonin is created from the amino acid tryptophan it is important to consume tryptophan rich foods good food sources of tryptophan are turkey chicken milk eggs nuts bananas beans fish and cheese however it is important to choose the right combination of foods as tryptophan has to compete with other amino acids to gain access to the brain if foods high in other amino acids such as tyrosine or methionine are consumed as in meat for example less tryptophan may make its way into the brain in order to remedy this problem it is important to also consume foods that are high in carbohydrates as they will also aid in boosting the creation of serotonin and increasing tryptophan absorption by eating carbohydrates the body will secrete insulin and the release of this hormone will help to minimize the absorption of the other amino acids that compete with tryptophan fortunately tryptophan is not affected by insulin therefore offering a toddler an evening snack such as whole grain crackers and cheese oatmeal with milk or some plain yogurt with banana will assist in preparing their body for rest calcium and magnesium foods that are rich in calcium and magnesium are also helpful for improving sleep these minerals help calm the nervous system and can help toddlers fall and stay asleep calcium can be found in dairy almonds sesame seeds leafy greens oranges and sardines whereas magnesium can be found in seeds nuts and green vegetables try and include these foods in their daily diet the age old remedy of offering warm milk to children before bed tends to be effective as it contains both calcium and tryptophan foods to avoid just as certain foods will help to prepare toddlers for sleep there are others that will interfere with sleep some of the more obvious ones are those that contain caffeine such as pop and chocolate toddlers should avoid these foods completely if they are having sleep issues high sugar foods are also problematic it is wise to avoid sugary snacks in the evening as these will also have a negative affect on sleep since they can cause a fluctuation of blood sugar levels immediately after eating a sugary snack blood sugar levels with increase a short while later they will fall significantly in order to try and restabilize blood sugar levels the body will later force the adrenal glands to release adrenaline – a stress hormone – which can cause toddlers to awaken once they have already fallen asleep on a final note it is also wise to determine if a toddler is suffering with a food intolerance which can also interfere with restful sleep the most common intolerances are dairy wheat soy corn eggs chocolate and nuts if you suspect an intolerance consider doing an elimination diet whereby these foods are all removed from the diet for 1014 days to see if any improvements are noted to determine which food is the culprit each can be added back into the diet one by one every four days and any sleep disturbances should be noted by lilian presti march 25 2009categories nest about the author lilian presti lilian is a registered holistic nutritionist who has worked in the nutrition and corporate wellness fields for the over a decade she teaches pediatric nutrition delivers corporate and public nutrition seminars runs a weightloss program does oneonone nutritional counseling and writes on nutrition and wellness topics since having her son noa lilian has taken a keen interest in educating mom’s to be and new parents about proper nutrition during these special periods lilian has been featured in elle magazine flare today’s bride and the weekly scoop msnsympatico’s weight loss challenge and appeared on city tv
