control c in expect scriptby jefe nubarron the expect computer scripting language derives its name from the primary function of the language which is to expect user input from an interactive program and automate the response expect is primarily used in systemsadministration type activities where an administrator may need to periodically interact with another system in a formulaic manner one common keystroke in systems administration is ctrlc typically used to abort a process expect is designed to automate any typical key or combination of keys that a system administrator might enter expect scripting language expect is a scripting language that was designed specifically to automate interaction with computer programs an expect script can allow a programmer or systems administrator to automate processes that would typically require user interaction don libes created the expect language while working at the national institute of standards and it has been implemented widely since the early 1990s expect is developed on top of the tcl scripting language and subroutine libraries the syntax for expect scripts is similar to that of tcl scripts controlccertain keyboard sequences have been adopted as standards in the computing world across platforms and operating systems the ctrlc command is one such significant key sequence particularly on unix platforms ctrlc is typed by simultaneously pressing the control key and the letter c key on the keyboard within a commandline environment in unix ctrlc has been widely adopted as an abort command scripts and commands are designed to terminate upon receiving a ctrlc interrupt a common shorthand for ctrlc is written as c ctrlc in expect it may be necessary to send or receive a ctrlc from within an expect script although it is more typical to send than receive such a command the safest way to send a ctrlc sequence in expect is to use the octal encoding capabilities of the tcl language all control codes have an equivalent octal sequence in ascii ctrlc has an octal value of three in ascii so the expect sequence would be 003 to send a ctrlc in expect using its octal value use the command send 003 in your script autoexpect one of the tools available to developers writing scripts in expect is autoexpect autoexpect is designed to generate an expect script through monitoring your interactions with another program autoexpect will reproduce your interactions in an expect script that can be used in the future you can use autoexpect to work through complexities you may encounter when coding an expect script if you are attempting to send or receive a ctrlc sequence in expect and your script does not behave as anticipated run an interaction through autoexpect to debug the issues you can run autoexpect from the command line on any computer where expect is installed with the autoexpect command referenceslink usenix expect scripts for controlling interactive processes don libeslink university of chicago expectlink sourceforge expect faq how do i send control characters or function keys about the author jefe nubarron has been writing technical articles since 1995 he has been published in technical magazines and on popular websites he has a bachelor of arts in anthropology and is working on additional coursework towards a masters degree more articles how to translate german to english with google what is the difference between an underline  an underscore how to enable acpi in bioshow does an apache web server work how to convert exe to code how to press buttons in batch file how does ssl protect against ip spoofing how to create a gpa calculator in visual basic 2008how to test the internet connection of ubuntu server
