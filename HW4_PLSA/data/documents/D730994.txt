this essential lysine author alexander yezovit lysine is one of the three most important essential amino acids that our body can only get from food it is the basis for building proteins in our body lysine is the first limiting amino acid needed to digest food proteins in the lack of it no matter how much proteins were in the food these still not assimilated to construct the proteins the body uses only llysine with age people especially men need more lysine than at younger ages most people get the necessary amount of lysine from the diet however a vegetarian diet and a lowfat diet the need for lysine can be not fully satisfied lysine is found in abundance in red meat chicken turkey dairy products such as yogurt and cottage cheese but some cereals such as wheat and corn contain too little lysine grinding grain destroys contained lysine so the white flour and other refined foods contain it very little lysine is also destroyed by cooking protein foods with sugar you need to provide your body with sufficient lysine if you have herpes are easily get tired can not concentrate perhaps you have a deficiency of lysine if you have bloodshot eyes or you often have nausea dizziness if you have hair fall out or you are suffering from anemia with a lack of lysine the whole protein metabolism is upset lysine builds proteins of muscle and collagen  the connective tissue component strength and elasticity of ligaments and tendons depend on lysine as well as of bones because lysine promotes the absorption of calcium and its incorporation into bone tissue it accelerates the recovery of bone tissue after injuries and operations prevents osteoporosis impaired lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis preventing heart attacks and strokes the lack of lysine in men may cause impotence in athletes especially in long distance runners lysine deficiency can lead to chronic inflammation of the tendons and muscle depletion the lack of lysine in the diet may also lead to a breach of hematopoiesis and decrease the amount of hemoglobin here are the basic functions of lysine in the body ensuring calcium absorption production of collagen to build bone cartilage and connective tissues production of antibodies of the immune system production of the hormones the endocrine system production of enzymes of the digestive system providing transport of blood oxygen and nutrients ensuring heart muscle operation ensuring nitrogen metabolism ensuring function of the gallbladder activation of the pineal gland and mammary glands ensuring assimilation of amino acids some important facts about the lysine1 lysine stops the development of herpes in 1950 it was found that certain amino acids contained in foods may stimulate or stop the growth of herpes virus thus the amino acid arginine accelerates the growth of the virus and lysine by contrast extends the period of remission with labial herpes on lips and genital herpes and prevents relapse although lysine not kill the virus but it still prevents the manifestation of its active symptoms especially blisters on the lips or around the genitals its effect is manifest in the fact that it does not give herpes virus absorb its favorite food  the amino acid arginine action of llysine has studied by means of clinical researches throughout the world their findings were published in the journal dermatologica 1978 in the journal chemotherapy 1981 and in journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy 1983 it was found that the viral reproduction is suppressed by intake of lysine while deficiency of arginine in the treatment of herpes should follow a diet high in lysine and minimum of arginine and take additional lysine in the form of supplements the dose of lysine to prevent a recurrence of the disease should be 1250 mg daily on an empty stomach the highest ratio of lysine  arginine are cheeses and other dairy products the lowest ratio  the majority of nuts and some fruit juices foods high in lysine  dairy products  soybeans  meat  lentils  spinach foods high in arginine  gelatin  nuts  chocolate high stress quickly depletes cellular reserves of lysine and herpes virus wakes up thats why people who live on the nerves are more likely to bouts of herpes the herpes virus can also cause sores and here too can be used lysine for the treatment in the treatment of herpes is useful to combine receiving lysine with nosugar diet and supplementation of vitamins a c and bioflavonoids antiviral properties of lysine may also help in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome hepatitis and hiv2 lysine prevents the development of atherosclerosis in 1996 matthias rath and alexander nedvetski clinically proven that in early atherosclerosis an increased intake of vitamin c 2700 mg per day lysine 450 mg per day proline 450 mg in combination with a complex of vitamins minerals and antioxidants retards the development of atherosclerosis in an average of 50 and in some cases leads to complete regression of atherosclerotic deposits dr matthias rath believes that lysine together with proline and vitamin c blocks the action of lipoprotein a which leads to clogged arteries lysine intercepts lp a and does not give them deposit on arterial walls at high enough concentrations it is able to extract the lp a and other lowdensity lipoproteins from the already formed atheroma therefore lysine is able to reduce high blood pressure which is one of the main causes of heart attacks and strokes lysine also supports the energy potential of the heart muscle so it serves as a source for development of carnitine  amino acid providing muscle energy3 lysine blocks spreading of metastases dr rath also found that lysine inhibits the action of collagenases  enzymes that dissolve the shell of the cancer which constrains its metastasis the most effective lock occurs while taking at the same time vitamin c lysine proline and epigallocatechine gallate  polyphenol a component of green tea in 2002 researches showed that in this case metastasis of cancer cells of various types are completely blocked reports about successful use of lysine derivatives for the treatment of breast and ovarian cancer have been published by research group of dr asted university of lund sweden in 1977 in 1980 dr suma from tokyo said about the treatment of inoperable ovarian cancer with metastases to the peritoneal cavity in this case the process was also stopped and within three years of observation relapse has not arisen as the biological mechanism of metastasis is the same for all types of cancer the use of lysine in combination with other similar substances can inhibit or completely block spreading cancer of all studied types as well as as it is expected the aids4 lysine prevents osteoporosis there is a correlation between lysine deficiency and the lack of calcium in bone tissue at present lysine is an essential part of prevention and treatment of osteoporosis all women in the postmenopausal age need to take a minimum of 500 mg of lysine per day and if their diet is not enough animal protein even more lysine is needed to absorb calcium from food and to incorporate it into bone with a deficit of lysine output of calcium with the urine increases complex supplements containing lysine and vitamin c can be used for prevention of osteoporosis prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis and also in antitumor therapy5 lysine accelerates the growth in 1981 the md a isidori with staff from the university of rome showed that the combination of lysine  arginine ten times stronger promotes the release of growth hormone than arginine alone the experiment was performed on youths aged 15 to 20 years lysine in combination with arginine is also used by bodybuilders for the combined effect of increasing muscle volume and strength6 lysine strengthens hair compared with many other factors of nutrition effect of essential amino acids for hair growth and hair loss is still poorly understood however scientists have linked the role of llysine in the absorption of iron and zinc from its effect on hair growth lysine supplementation reduces the rate of hair loss and makes hair thicker this effect is more pronounced if together with llysine take also iron and zinc supplements7 lysine prevents the lens from damage high blood sugar levels in diabetes type i or ii may cause damage of the lens and eye cataract formation along with taking chromium picolinate and zinc daily intake of 500 mg llysine slows down this process8 lysine strengthens the immune system adequate provision the body with essential amino acids is a prerequisite for the normal functioning of the immune system particularly important is the normal supply of the two amino acids  lysine and arginine these amino acids are needed to produce a sufficient number of neutrophils entering into a strategic defense system against hepatitis b and c hiv chronic fatigue syndrome and any immunodeficiency states special complex drug virago to improve antiviral immunity was developed primarily against herpes simplex virus but it works successfully against many other infectious diseases it includes along with herbal ingredients also llysine and zinc9 lysine slows down aging studies conducted in 1984 at the mayo clinic showed that lysine in combination with arginine can enhance the secretion of thyroid hormones in the elderly which also helps to prevent senile immunodeficiency this can be associated with increased secretion of growth hormone   it should also be noted that lysine is important for efficient operation of the brain its deficiency may impair shortterm memory and ability to concentrate reproductive sphere also suffer with a deficiency of lysine  in women this may lead to loss of libido in men  to reduce erectile function   this article is copyrighted by alexander yezovit it cannot be reprinted without permission from alexander yezovit alexander yezovit thematic center health
