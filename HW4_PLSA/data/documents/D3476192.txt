beautifully stained glass or an intricately woven stole all are examples of well art or craft hang around a little longer for you are about to get your answer most of us are in awe of crafts and the objects that it produces and a lot many of us often enjoy them more than anything that is a product of art what we miss out on is a clear conception of what tells them apart from each other craft is derived from kraft which is german for power or ability it is basically any kind of skilled work that involves application of a technique craft is more about the application of human touch and intelligence than a mechanical technology a craftsman does have tools at his command but independent of human guidance these cannot accomplish any task an interesting angle to crafts is that this concept is historically associated with creation of beautiful and useful objects you would argue that a craftsman’s teapot or vase should be able to hold tea or flowers and you are probably right an object of craft tends to be useful for various purposes and it may also be pretty and pleasing in any number of ways the fine line between art  craft on the other hand an artist’s work is well it doesn’t really have a utility to offer except maybe imparting a pleasant experience to your senses and a quick escape from reality to a world of bliss having said that let’s try to understand art as well with subtle comparisons with crafts often involving some kind of handwork and commonly resulting in the production of a useful object is not enough to distinguish it from art the reason being that works of art — paintings music pieces and its performance poetry and more require skill and constant practice moreover these account for numerous great works that preserve culture signify talent and creativity offer solace and peace these might not be tangible utilities but we still highly appreciated them as among them are works of architecture that hold enormous practical value british philosopher r g collingwood says we can understand the criteria which distinguish art from craft a very important and interesting point of distinction between art and craft rests in their planning and execution the craftsman is usually sure of the result that he wants to obtain he has a strong preconceived notion or thought towards which his work is targeted the foreknowledge of knowing what he seeks in his creation is never vague and this is what is “indispensable” to craft definiteness of craft a furniture maker is a typical craftsman he sets out to make a chair or a table by writing down the specific measurements of the pieces of timber required to make it he would not go about it vaguely in his mind what don’t make for a craft are a few informed guesses and a trial and error approach there is a dependability about it which comes from the application of a learned technique a craftsperson knows what the final product will look like and this aspect essentially differentiates it from art though overlapping in practice and intimately involved with each other there is an innate predictability in crafts that is backed by application of a learned and teachable skill this skill is aimed at a preconceived result art on the other hand is an expression of human emotion talent and intellect it may hold different meanings to different individuals uncertainty of art in case of art there is this inherent uncertainty that is evident in every stroke of a paint brush that a painter makes on a canvas it is quite identical in every syllable that an actor utters on stage provided he is into improvising as well nobody knows what the eventual piece is going to look like until the last bit of detail is put in no critic can appraise the performance until the act is complete and a response is aroused from the audience a magician too is a performer and he is the archetypical craftsman he conjures things up and performs magic tricks to amaze his audience and unlike an actor or a painter he has complete control over his craft he knows the tricks of his trade and he knows exactly what to do to get the desired response from his audience in many respects filmmaking is a craft too as it requires the work of countless numbers of highly trained intelligent and skillful people be it scripting casting lighting directing cinematography special effects acting or promotion the whole key to this activity is what will sell although the reaction of the audience is unpredictable but the final piece is more or less preconceived and quite tangible but then there are filmmakers that focus on coming up with plots that are intrinsically fabricated to depict deep rooted emotions deep human feelings and desires that may be more related to the arts than to crafts are displayed via these projects and so the line grows thin here relation between art  craft but by now it seems that the demarcation between art and craft might just be our imagination it is so because almost all traditionally acknowledged arts indeed require craft which is to say that they all require application of a technique also training for any artistic discipline requires for the practitioner to attain a certain level of expertise in techniques though this too differs for different arts such as writing singing playing an instrument or painting for all of them require different degrees of effort and conditioning elements of art in many creations of crafts the love of materials the leap of imagination and the ability to delight and jar the audience with something distinct all this sheds enough light on the fact that there are certain symptoms of craft that are common to art as well both require a technique a proficient routine and manipulation of audiences in fact the line grows even thinner when we consider producing art for a particular market be it art or craft external or social needs usually govern the final output so yes art and craft overlap and assist in defining each other they coexist and depend on each other and yet in many instances rebel against each other if put in the same accord art is an expression of emotions is unstructured  open ended cannot be easily quantified cannot be duplicated it moves people on an emotional level originates from the heart and soul is a result of a person’s innate talents lets emotions play craft results in a tangible output is innately structured can be easily quantified can be easily duplicated it attracts people on a physical level originates from the mind is a result of acquired skill  experience makes room for practical thought in conclusion most of us do not consider them different and rightly so because attempting to define one exclusive of the other is impossible that implies that art is not a separate

this distinction is a moving target until about 3040 years ago the difference was defined in terms of function art was nonfunctional craft could and usually did have function you could use it for something but then the american crafts movement really got going and craftspeople began to get awesomely creative with crafts while artists simultaneously started using everydamnthing as substrates oh look at that sidewalk that wall that cutting board that airplane so the old definition really didnt work anymore ive read and heard many other attempts at how to divide the two since and most arent really very satisfactory the problem tends to be aesthetics people see a really beautiful work of craft and they simply want to say that it is art but why isnt it art they will ask almost crying its so beautiful and it is true that much craft is absolutely gorgeous many people who create crafts are genuinely artistic however there still remains a difference between art and craft and i think the best definition i have heard comes from an artist i respect who said an artist will never let his material dictate his art but a craftsman will a craftsman will let his material make his final decisions frankly i do not know if this distinction absolutely covers every single instance of every single artwork and craftwork and every artist and every craftperson in the entire world but it seems to me it covers most and tends to work as a general rule so this is what i would use  at least for now124k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to date ian forsyth former director of arts and culture at city of north vancouver answered feb 22 2018it can be said that all great art involves great craft but you would not say all or any craft is a work of art it can be staggeringly beautiful and executed with amazing skill but you are still able to quantify it and at the end of the day it usually serves a purpose and can be replicated in any quantity however these kinds of discussions can run the risk of dividing people which neither art nor craft wish to do so i say enjoy it allas an illustration and it is more from me and my theater training perspective that i’ll tell this …it can be argued that film is more a craft than art although that line can become very blurry at times however when we view a film the only variable is in the audience the film is finished done whereas a live performance is never finished the variables in the room are at least twofold and probably much more than that the actor or singer dancer or musician walks into the theatre or performance space with another day of living behind them it might have been a good day a challenging one perhaps one that had not been “unpacked” and the audience is different too people in an audience are always going to be a different mix and rarely do their differences homogenize the sum total of them so those two variables alone guarantee a slightly differet performance that unlike film will never be repeated and is never the same that’s why when it works and it doesn’t always or even often it’s the most exciting thing to witness and you and the 4–800 people around you now have a profound shared experience a secret you might say…you were all there “that night” and felt what happened now that’s art 261 views · view upvoterspromoted by at perrys

dont think there is i know there is craft is considered work that is produced in multiples by a skilled craftsman  it applies to object that we would use rather than artwork that we would display examples of craft are pottery glassware woodcraft jewelry and such a craftsperson is a skilled artisan whose technique is forged to produce objects for use  a teapot a bowl furniture art as i believe you are asking is art for the purpose only of creating art the works are often single works unique and meant for display only not for use now craftspeople do employ artistic skill in the application of their trade they do train in art and often may apprentice with a master artist the work they execute would be considered craft when it is produced in small to medium scale a potter may work on many multiples of works to sell now if they choose to create oneofakind objects then that becomes elevated to fine art the distinction is that a craftsperson is essentially manufacturing their works by

wiam benbrahim zentangle mosaic yarn artist and a graphic design student answered oct 18 2016 · author has 82 answers and 599k answer views traditionally art was mainly the domain of men and craft of women therefore the crafts were automatically considered less important there is also an attitude that in the arts originality is more important while its okay for crafts to be derived from other peoples crafts more directly in reality art is often imitative and craft can be very creative and original finally it is an arbitrary distinction between different practices for example painting is always referred to as an art while needlework is defined as a craft until someone like kaffe fassett does it who is certainly a genius but i also think the perception that he has elevated a craft to an art form has a lot to do with him being a man if a woman did something just as beautiful in a traditional womens craft i doubt if it would recieve the same level of attention711 views · view

beloved questions think of a seesaw on one side is art—and on the other craft likewise on one side is “creation” and on the other “recreation”it is very likely impossible to create an item of pure art for that to happen there would have to be zero element of craft in it—and you can’t have a onesided seesaw a “unique” painting paint has been used before “painting” with elephant dung that’s been done “painting” with bubble gum “painting”— as painting itself has been done before and so it goes with all human activity for an item of pure art to be created all of its techniques materials and processes would have to be original and once any even the least element of that new form is used even the second time it alters into an element of craft if and to whatever extent someone copies what has been done before that is the “element of craft” in the article art is creation craft is recreation862 views · view upvoters benjamin scottpye artist intp sceptic secular humanist wrestling fan

you to render what you see before you in paint really well and might also include replicating other peoples art styles and learning their skills the painting starts to have artistic merit when you start to apply your own concepts and ideas to the work rather than it just being the application of technical skills youve picked up studying others i generally think of it as art being the soul and the feeling and the creativity and craft just being the knowledge and the skill and the understanding of the medium you are working with which is why a potter who churns out the same few pieces at a rapid rate is creating crafts rather than art unless there is some underlying concept behind the pot making but then thats applying creativity to something that isnt very creative thats kind of how i

believe that they describe different things craft is the technical ability while art is the creative ability both are necessary to create works of art someone can have incredible artistic vision but not have the skills necessary to translate that vision into a tangible form for others to enjoy others may have high craft skills in constructing something yet not have the creative vision to create something different as an example take carpentry carpentry is a crafting skill that is much needed and takes a great deal of time and education to learn just about anyone could learn to do basic carpentry given enough time dedication and the right tools however to do carpentry with artistic flair to create a work of art using those skills takes artistic vision and creativity on the other hand an artist can envision a beautiful piece of art but not have the craft or ability to create it therefore the beautiful piece is never made and therefore never seen both skills are required to make

upvoters harshad dubey answered jul 28 2016art vs craft most people do not see any difference between art and craft as they are both considered to be forms of creativity let’s consider how art and craft differ art is a form of work that is the expression of emotions craft is a form of work which results in a tangible output for example moulding and carving art is often described as unstructured and open ended it has no limitations of expression just like in painting craft on the other hand is structured which means that it has a certain form that is visible while craft can be quantified this is more difficult to do with art â another thing that can be seen is that one can create duplicate craft forms which is not possible with art it can also be seen that art forms move people on an emotional level whereas crafts attract people for example a piece of painting can create emotions in a person whereas a piece of jewellery or pottery can be an attraction unlike craft art is known to come out of the heart and soul crafts come out of the mind and need considerable practise to come out with worldclass forms art is a result of a person’s innate talents whereas skill in craft can be acquired with experience craft forms can be called skilled forms in craft more practical thought is needed whereas in art it is the emotions that make a perfect creation art is more related to aesthetics a craftsman will have an idea about what he wants to actually make in art it is the emotions that flow out whereas in craft no emotion is involved pottery metal works glass works and jewellery are some examples of craft works painting architectureâ and sculpture are examples of art forms summary art is a form of work that expresses emotions and expressions craft is a form of work which has a physical form just like in moulding and carving while craft is quantified art seldom is one can create duplicate craft forms which is not possible with art art forms move people emotionally whereas crafts attract people unlike craft art is known to come out of the heart and soul crafts are a product of the mind in art it is the emotions that flow out whereas in craft no

creating something that pertains within the field of art art is the broader definition of anything created for any reason it’s such a broad definition that i couldn’t possibly try and define it — humans and art critics have been trying to do that for centuries craft refers more specifically to the process of creating typically when i hear craft i think of someone using their hands and tools to create a final product i use a computer and tablet others use clay and wheels and the majority use pen and paper crafting is the act of creating something thus one can interpret the union of both of these terms as “the process of making something” with artistic intentions being specified by the work itself or the people who experience it the school i go to used to be known as “college of arts and

crafts should be fun and i encourage every individual to express their artistic ability one of the most difficult parts of all arts and crafts would be to figure out what to do on arts and crafts projects what i will do in this article is go over some of the dilemmas before you get to them this should help you pick your crafts project faster making everything more efficient and more fun the first dilemma i will address will be that of the age range youll find in a particular arts and crafts setting that different projects go better with different age groups it would be very inefficient to give a complex arts and crafts project like quilting to a toddler it could also be very frustrating for a normal teenager to do a arts and crafts project containing only construction paper and glue group size is also another factor that affects your project in a large group setting it may be better to do a project where there is a team effort put into the arts and crafts in a small group setting it may be better to tackle the situation on a solo tip but please remember with most arts and crafts projects the more the merrier some arts and crafts projects can be very timeconsuming while others take very little time one of the main things to decide is how much time you will be spending on your project will the project be split into several days will it only lasts a couple hours or can it be an ongoing arts and crafts project for the whole semester to figure out what time frame works best for you make sure you do some research on how long it would take to complete that particular arts and crafts project45 views sam andrew works at selfemployment answered may 11 2016 · author has 100 answers and 333k answer views originally answered do you think there is differences between art and
