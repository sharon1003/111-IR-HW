how to measure a horse the horse height  weight how to measure a horses height and weight … all horse owners should know how to measure a horse and especially how to estimate your horses weight and specify its height your horses weight measurement should be used to calculate how much feed it needs as well as dosage for worming and other medications knowing your horses’ height is very important if you are considering selling your horse or entering some classes of equestrian competition particularly showing classes horse heights conversion table  horses and ponies are measured in either hands high hh or centimetres cms the decimal centimetre measurement being the more modern way to measure a horse but quite a few horse owners struggle to compare the two measurements so we thought a horse measurement conversion chart would come in handy  hands cms hands cms hands cms hands cms hands cms80 81 90 91 100 102 110 112 120 12281 84 91 94 101 104 111 114 121 12482 86 92 97 102 107 112 117 122

ground a horse that is 61 inches tall is 151 hands or 15 hands and 1 inch or 151hh this is calculated using 614  1525 the 25 is the decimal equivalent of one quarter and a quarter of 4  1 so 151hh alternatively to calculate the centimetre height either mulitply 61 inches by 254 which equals apprx 155cms or divide 61 by 4 and then multiply by 102 which again equals approximately 155cms a pony is 142 hands or less at the withers calculating your horses weight is a little more complicated  knowing your horses weight at least approximately can be very helpful for such simple things as calculating feed amounts and knowing how much wormer to administer as it’s not easy to find a weighing machine or scale big enough to accommodate your horse there are several ways of calculating a horse’s approximate weight of course if you have a farmer friend or have access to livestock scales then use those for a truly accurate measurement the following two methods are among the most common approximation methods and provide a good idea of your horses weight1 height and weight tapes  probably the most common method people use to estimate their horses weight is to buy and use a heightweight tape you simply wrap the tape around your horses girth aka heart girth and read the estimated weight on the tape the height and weight tape has been available for many years and horse owners generally feel they are very reliable they usually come complete with instructions on how to use them you can find low cost examples on ebay and other online stores2 measuring your horses’ weight using a standard inch tape …another way to estimate your horses weight is to use a standard inch tape to measure its girth and length then simply perform the following calculation   heartgirth x heartgirth x bodylength divided by 300  50  weight how to take the horse weight measurements  step 1 measuring heart girth to measure your horses heart girth measure in inches from the base of the withers down to a couple of inches behind your horses front legs then under the belly and up the opposite side to where you started the tape measure should run at an angle as shown by the yellow line in the image on the right this measurement is your horses heart girth step 2 measuring body length to measure your horses body length measure in inches from the point of the shoulder to the point of the hip your tape measure should run at an angle as shown by the yellow line in the image the measurement you take is your horses body length step 3 the calculation multiply the heartgirth by the heartgirth multiply the above result by the bodylength divide this result by 300 then add 50the result is your horses aprroximate body weight practical use  testing we were curious to know if a heightweight tape would give the same estimated weight for a horse as calculating weight with the manual heart girth and length calculation we tried both methods on the same horse and you can see the results we came up with below how close will the results be for each method  any method that doesn’t actually use a calibrated weight scale is always going to be a rough approximation based on accepted norms generalities and averagesie the average 152hh cob type has a heavy chest and shoulders so will weigh between x and y the 152hh thoroughbred is finely built and will be light for its height both methods should be reasonably close but the answers will vary depending on how close your horse is to the average horse the height and weight tape doesn’t factor in your horses body length and as we all know a tall horse can be short backed and a short horse can have a long body so we measured our 6 year old 163hh 170cms thoroughbred warmblood cross she’s a big girl and well covered due to the wet summer hot autumn and plentiful grass the heightweight tape gave us a value between 1320lbs 600kgs and 1380lbs 627kgsmeasuring by hand we calculated   70×70x7530050  1275lbs 580kgsclose enough to reassure us that we’re feeding correctly and using the correct dose of horse wormer to get any closer to the true weight of your horse you need access to a livestock scalehorse health
