110 comments homemade almond milk  almond meal48kshare 262 pin 48k tweet yesterday i shared with you the super easy tutorial for making almond butter and other nut butters and as i expected it was a huge hit if you haven’t checked it out yet you can view it here today we’re making almond milk and i think it’s just as awesome if not more so hubby and i only recently started getting into the world of almond milk to tell you the truth not because of any dairy allergies or anything we were just interested in venturing out and trying alternatives to cow’s milk why almond milk turns out almond milk is actually pretty healthy compared to cow’s milk it’s lower in fat calories and cholesterol and higher in vitamin a vitamin e and iron the only significant area that cow’s milk is better nutritionally is protein so if you need a dairyfree alternative to cow’s milk almond milk is a great choicewhy homemade that being said i’ve been wanting to try making almond milk at home for a while but it wasn’t until i read this article from chrystal at happy mothering which warned of the dangers of a common ingredient in coconut and almond milk carageenan which has been deemed carcinogenic yikes although the brand that we’ve been buying silk didn’t list carageenan in the ingredients it did have a bunch of other ingredients listed on the carton mostly stabilizers and extra vitamins how to make homemade almond milk that was it i decided – i was going to make my own almond milk once and for all and i’m so glad i did it’s so easy it’s more natural and honestly it tastes waaaay better plus you can add in your own extras to flavor it just the way you likesoak your almonds you’ll start out by soaking 1 cup of almonds in just enough water to cover them by an inch or two the recommended time is 812 hours but if you can only do a couple hours that’s fine too soaking the almonds not only helps to soften them but it also removes the phytic acid an enzyme inhibitor to aid in digestion and nutrient absorption blend your almonds after soaking drain the almonds and rinse them add them to your blender and cover with 4 cups water turn the blender on high and let it go for at least a full minute turn it off it will be nice and frothy taste the milk and if you like it you can move on to the next step but if you’d like to sweeten it like i did you can add some honey and dates i added a big tablespoonful of raw honey and 3 dates turn the blender back on for another 30 seconds or so strain your milk now you can either leave it like this and drink as it is which is a bit gritty or you can strain the milk to remove the almond pulp simply line a fine strainer or sieve with 34 layers of cheesecloth or better yet use a nut milk bag  place the strainer over a bowl to catch the milk and pour your almond milk through the cheeseclothlined strainer it will take a while about half an hour or so for all the milk to make it through the strainer you can help the process along by pressing the almond pulp with the back of a wooden spoon or spatula or you can just get really impatient like i did and proceed to squeeze the living daylights out of that pulp … i don’t recommend this though patience is a virtue afterall after you’ve strained all the milk you’ll be left with a good amount of almond pulp do not throw this away you’ve just made almond meal or flour and can use this in a number of recipes for muffins cookies quick breads etc more on that below transfer your milk to a glass jar and keep it in the fridge and use it as you would normally use cow’s milk put it on cereal use it in smoothies drink it plain or with chocolate syrup i’ve also tried it in coffee but didn’t like it at all so i’d advise against that some extra notes it should keep in the fridge for up to 4 days although we’ve kept ours for about a week without an issue just smell the milk if it smells funky then its time has come after a while in the fridge the milk will begin to separate so just make sure to shake or stir it real well before you use it you can experiment with flavoring the milk increase the dates decrease the honey add some vanilla or cinnamon cocoa powder maple syrup… whatever your heart or tummy desiresfor a thicker creamier milk i found this post from one ingredient chef and he advises to heat your milk for a few minutes to help thicken it up to the consistency of regular milk or even cream i’m trying this out for sure what about the almond pulp i’m glad you asked like i said before please don’t throw this away it’s very nutritious stuff and it’s not everyday you can make something that uses the ingredients and the byproduct for a truly nowaste productyour almond pulp will be very wet and chunky you have two options at this point turn it into almond mealflour or use it as is drying your almond pulp you’ll need to dry out the pulp before you can use it in recipes that call for almond flour if you have a dehydrator you can put it in at 115 degrees and leave it overnight until it’s dry if you’re using an oven like i did line a baking sheet with parchment paper spread the almond pulp into a thin layer and put it in your oven on the lowest possible setting start checking on it after a couple hours stir it up every once in a while so it dries evenly mine was done after about 3 hours i’ve read you can also leave the door open to release any moisture which helps it dry faster i couldn’t do this because of my toddler running around so i imagine it could go even faster if you’re able to do this once it’s dry put it into your food processor and give it a good whirl to break up the pieces and process it to a fine powder behold you now have almond meal or almond flour the one cup of almonds should give you just about a cup of almond meal you can use it in any recipe that calls for almond flour or you can replace some not all of the wheat flour in your favorite recipes – muffins cookies quick breads are all great choiceshow to use leftover almond pulp as great as it is to dry out the pulp and use it in recipes i find that i just can’t use it all up fast enough so i end up just throwing the wet pulp in a big freezer bag and storing it in the freezer until i’m ready to use it i’ve made these almond pulp freezer fudge many times and love ithomemade almond milk write a review save recipe print ingredients1 cup almonds
