namecomparing a human and avian skeleton the avian bird skeleton has many features that resemble the human skeleton and the majority of the bones are the same they are only shaped different when structures are similar in different organisms they are called homologous the main difference between the human and bird skeleton is that the birds skeleton is adapted for flight for instance the bones of a bird are hollow which makes the skeleton lighter the collarbone of the bird is fused for stability and is called the furculum color the bones as indicated below the arm bones of the human consist of the humerus the radius and the ulna these bones are also found in the bird on both skeletons color the humerus g pink color the radius f green and the ulna e light green note the shape of the bones on the image labeled “forelimbs” and color them the same color as you did in the bird and human the leg consists of a long femur which attaches to the pelvis and then two bones of the lower leg in the bird these two bones the tibia and fibula are fused together in humans they are separated you are probably familiar with the tibia of the bird thats the part you eat called the drumstick when you eat the thigh of the bird the bone within it is the femur on both skeletons color the pelvis m yellow the femur n orange and the tibia o light blue on the human only color the fibula p dark blue also on the human skeleton the patella also called the kneecap is visible color the patella s green on the image labeled “hindlimbs” color the bones appropriately the head of both birds and humans is protected by a large cranium the upper jaw of the human and the upper beak of the bird is composed of a bone called the maxilla the lower jaw and lower beak is composed of a bone called the mandible on both skeletons color the cranium a red the maxilla b grey and the mandible c pink the differences between the bird and human skeleton are very apparent in the pectoral girdle which is the place where the forelimbs attach to the spine the birds forelimbs are wings and must have a strong support system the collarbone of the bird is fused to form the furculum or wishbone the shoulder blade of the human is actually a bone called the scapula birds have a scapula and they also have an additional shoulder bone called the corocoid on both skeletons color the scapula k dark brown on the bird color the furculum j black and the corocoid l light brown on the human color the collarbone j black another obvious difference between the human and bird skeleton is the shape and size of the sternum a birds sternum is large and positioned under the body  flight muscles attach to this bone the ridge of the birds sternum is called a keel the ribs are attached to the spine and to the sternum on both skeletons color the sternum h red and the ribs r blue on the bird trace the edge of the sternum in green to show the keel i the vertebrae of the bird and human are similar except for the bone where the tail feathers attach called the pygostyle humans have a tailbone that is similar but it is not pictured color the vertebrae d yellow and the pygostyle q purple examine the bones of the forelimbs and hind limbs color those bones the same as you did above finally study the rat skeleton you will find the same bones in a rat as you do on a human or a bird using the colors listed above color the rat appropriately  you will need to figure out which bones are which based on their shape and their location good luckquestions1 define homologous 2 name two ways in which the birds skeleton is adapted for flight 3 what bone is the drumstick  what bone is the wishbone  4 what two bones make up the birds beak  5 what three bones make up the birds forelimb  what two bones make up the birds hind limb  6 the pectoral girdle is the area of the skeleton that attaches the arm bones to the spine in humans the pectoral girdle consists of the scapula and the clavicle collarbone what three bones make up the pectoral girdle of the bird  7 the patella is also called the  8 the “thigh” of the bird contains what bone  9 what is the scientific name for the “shoulderblade”  10 the tail feathers attach to what bone  11 list two bones you will find in a bird but not in a human 12 list two bones you will find in a human but not in a bird 13 how many bones are in a human’s leg  in a bird’s  how many bones are in a human’s arm  in a bird’s wing  the longest bone in the bird’s leg is the  in a humans  14 identify this bone 15 next to each letter on the human skeleton write the name of the bone this work is licensed under a creative commons attributionnon commercialshare alike 40 international license downloadable doc file image source biodidac related documents skeleton label  digestive system coloring comparing the avian and human skeleton key individual bird skeleton  individual human skeleton
