answer the best answers are voted up and rise to the top why is water from the dispenser slow after replacing the water filter on my refrigeratorup vote3down votefavorite1at one of our rental properties we have a ge gsh25jfxn ww refrigerator our tenant changed out the water filter because of the recommended time to change it he said that before he changed the filter there was good water flow at the water dispenser after changing the filter water flow at the dispenser was slow heres his email before i went out there yesterdaythanks for the email i changed out the filter because it had been on for longer than 6 months when i took the old filter off thats when i noticed there might be a potential leak where the filter is attached i installed the new filter and the water would barely come out ive changed out the filter before and never had this issue i gave the reservoir time to fill and i also held down the water dispensing mechanism for 5 minutes at the request of ge customer service to make sure any air was pushed out of the tubing was still slow coming out ge recommended trying another filter in case the one i got was defective i bought the official ge mwf water filter each time and am still having the same problem my rough estimation is that its taking 7 seconds to fill about 1 ounce heres a picture of the point of connection for the water dispenser also when you take out the water filter it kind of leaks at the connection and it stops when i press on a little white button on the right i went there yesterday to try some things i checked to see if there werent any kinks in the piping i found none i tried this solution httpboogsterblogspotcom201110geprofilerefrigeratorslowwaterhtml i didnt know what part the person was sharpening i tried cleaning the water discharge at the filter with a pipe cleaner and didnt feel like there was any blockage there so i noticed that he turned off the icemaker i asked him to turn on the icemaker to see if any ice were to be made this was around 530pm yesterday i followed up with them today 12 noon and he said the followingjust looked actually ice was made but not very much at all the ice was also thin and even hollow in some spots so its not getting very much water to make the ice i wanted to see if its the main water supply to refrigerator or something that is just affecting just the water dispenser i have attached pictures of the water filters for reference there is a slight difference in the both of them the old one is on the rightappliances refrigerator waterfiltrationshare improve this

from the filter and allows it to flow into the ice maker or into the water outlet i had this same problem and a repairman told me it was the valve i replace the valve and it was still slow so i replace the filter and it was perfectfor a couple of months now we are back down to a trickle – jim clark sep 13 14 at 1130what happens when you put the old filter back on related

vote2down vote i had the same issue and it turned out to be air in the system when you install a new filter its full of air i took out the filter dumped out the water out of the filter refilled the filter in the sink and reinstalled the filter it took a few tries to get all of the air out of the systemshare improve this answeranswered oct 5 14 at 2352dave21 2add a commentup vote1down vote yes air will have that effect other things to consider if there is a valve that feeds the fridge make sure it is all the way open even if there is no need to shut it off to change the filtrr the tenant may have done so and then not turned it all the way back on also for my fridge at least not all filters are the same the whiz bang filter model that includes carbon flows much more slowly than the cheap filter last ive never seen a fridge with its own water pump they just use line pressure hence my advice to make sure all feed valves are all the way openshare improve this answeranswered oct 6 14 at 217bobfandango1261 1 6 13add a commentup vote0down vote ive just ran into the exact same issue with our ge water dispenser im suspecting the water pump since the water pressure at the filter hookup is good it will fill a bit then pump a bit out and then slow down to a crawl every other time ive replaced the filter the water shot out like crazyshare improve this answeranswered aug 23 14 at 533perry11do you mean specifically the water pump for your well or a water pump inside the refrigerator – tdhofstetter aug 24 14 at 010add a commentup vote0down vote when i had the same issue i just bypassed the filter by connecting the water source directly to the water inlet this showed me that there was an issue somewhere between the water filter and the water inletshare improve this

changing filter i took the filter out and inserted the bypass now a glass that took 3 mins to fill takes 3 seconds i read somewhere that the problem can be solved by putting a dime sized washer over the head will also fix it apparently the filter is obstructing the water flowshare improve this answeranswered oct 6 14 at 224denise1add a commentup vote0down vote well i took a look at the new filter and it had an oring in side the filter and i took this out reinstalled the filter and water flows like it did when new so it appears the filter have evolved i figured since the valve already had two orings i would be safe water flow good and no leaksshare improve this answeranswered oct 22 14 at 126scott1are you the same person as mguzman72 – tom g oct 24 14 at 259add a commentprotected by
