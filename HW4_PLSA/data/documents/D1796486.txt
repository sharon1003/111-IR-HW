other elements and compounds are conductors materials that charge cannot flow through are called insulators air glass most plastics and rubber are insulators for example and then there are some materials called semiconductors that seemed to be good conductors sometimes but much less so other times silicon and germanium are two such materials there is a force between them the potential for work and thus a voltage now we connect a conductor between them a metal wire on the positively charged sphere positive charges rush along the wire to the other sphere repelled by the nearby similar charges and attracted to the distant opposite charges the same thing occurs on the other sphere and negative charge flows out on the wire positive and negative charges combine to neutralize each other and the flow continues until there are no charge differences between any points of the entire connected system there may be a net residual charge if the amounts of original positive and negative charge were not equal but that charge will be distributed evenly so all the forces are balanced if they were not more charge would flow the charge flow is driven by voltage or potential differences after things have quieted down there is no voltage difference between any two points of the system and no potential for work all the work has been done by the moving charges heating up the wire fig  1  two spheres with opposite charges are connected by a conductor allowing charge to flow the flow of charge is called electrical current current is measured in amperes a amps for short named after another french scientist who worked mostly with magnetic effects an ampere is defined as a flow of one coulomb of charge in one second past some point while a coulomb is a lot of charge to have in one place an ampere is a common amount of current about one ampere flows through a 100 watt incandescent light bulb and a stove burner or a large motor would require ten or more amperes on the other hand low power digital circuits use only a fraction of an ampere and so we often use units of 11000 of an ampere a milliamp abbreviated as ma and even 11000 of a milliamp or a microamp µa learn more on basics of electronics electronics definitions electronics is the branch of science that deals with the study of flow and control of electrons electricity and the study of their behavior and effects in vacuums gases and semiconductors and with devices using such electrons rules of electrical circuits  a voltage of 1v across a resistance of 1 ohm will cause a current flow of 1 amp and the resistor will dissipate 1 watt all as heat what is an electronic circuit a circuit is a structure that directs and controls electric currents presumably to perform some useful function the very name circuit implies that the structure is closed something like a loop current charge is mobile and can flow freely in certain materials called conductors metals and a few other elements and compounds are conductors materials that charge cannot flow through are called insulators air glass most plastics and rubber are insulators for example and then there are some materials called semiconductors that seemed to be good conductors sometimes but much less so other times silicon and germanium are two such materials the flow of charge is called electrical current current is measured in amperes a amps for short named after another french scientist who worked mostly with magnetic effects wiring symbols there are many different representations for basic wiring symbols and these are the most common the conventions i use for wires crossing and joining are marked with a star   the others are a small sample of those in common use but are fairly representative many can be worked out from their position in the circuit diagram schematic voltage voltage is something is a type of pressure that drives electrical charges through a circuit bodies with opposite charges attract they exert a force on each other pulling them together the magnitude of the force is proportional to the product of the charge on each mass what is charge  charge may be defined as the quantity of unbalanced electricity in a body either positive or negative and construed as an excess or deficiency of electrons charge comes in two forms  positive   and negative charge     batteries charges can be separated by several means to produce a voltage a battery uses a chemical reaction to produce energy and separate opposite sign charges onto its two terminals as the charge is drawn off by an external circuit doing work and finally returning to the opposite terminal more chemicals in the battery react to restore the charge difference and the voltage the particular type of chemical reaction used determines the voltage of the battery but for most commercial batteries the voltage is about 15 v per chemical section or cell resistors a resistor is an electrical device that resists the flow of electrical current it is a passive device used to control or impede the flow of electric current in an electric circuit by providing resistance thereby developing a drop in voltage across the device the value of a resistor is measured in ohms and represented by the greek letter capital omega resistors usually have a brown cylindrical body with a wire lead on each end and colored bands that indicate the value of the resistor ohm’s law ohms law describes the relationship between voltage v  which is trying to force charge to flow resistance r  which is resisting that flow and the actual resulting current i  power power is the electric energy produced per unit time capacitors in simple words we can say that a capacitor is a device used to store and release electricity usually as the result of a chemical action also referred to as a storage cell a secondary cell a condenser or an accumulator a leyden jar was an early example of a capacitor inductors an inductor is an electrical device typically a conducting coil that introduces inductance into a circuit an inductor is a passive electrical component designed to provide inductance in a circuit it is basically a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core simplest form an inductor is made up of a coil of wire the inductance measured in henrys is proportional to the number of turns of wire the wire loop diameter and the material or core the wire is wound around semiconductor devices a conductor made with semiconducting material semiconductors are made up of a substance with electrical properties intermediate between a good conductor and a good insulator a semiconductor device conducts electricity poorly at room temperature but has increasing conductivity at higher temperatures metalloids are usually good semiconductors silicon silicon atomic number 14 on the periodic table is a semiconducting material from which integrated circuits computer chips of all typesprocessors memory chips etc  ccds transistors etc are created silicon is one of the most common elements silicon is also the semiconductor material out of which almost all modern transistors are made diodes a diode is an electronic device that allows current to flow in one direction only it is a semiconductor that consists of a pn junction they are used most commonly to convert ac to dc because they pass the positive part of the wave and block the negative part of the ac signal or if they are reversed they pass only the negative part and not the positive part electronic component name abbreviations here is a list of electronic component name abbreviations widely
