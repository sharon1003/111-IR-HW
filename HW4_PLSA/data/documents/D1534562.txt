 after he saw the phrase on a painting by mexican artist frida kahlo he explained she went through a lot of st of course and then she started a big painting in her house that said viva la vida i just loved the boldness of it the movie frida starring salma hayek is about her life you can see the painting that inspired the title in song images both this and  violet hill  debuted in the top 40 of the billboard hot 100 chart for week ending may 24 2008 it is a rare feat for an act to have two songs debuting in the same week this song was released exclusively on i tunes and was featured in a commercial for the musicdownload service that showed stylized images of the band performing the song the spot hyped the song nicely presenting the name of it at the end  helpful since the title doesnt appear in the lyrics bassist guy berryman explained to q magazine july 2008 about this song that features lyrics about cavalries missionaries and kings its a story about a king whos lost his kingdom and all the albums artwork is based on the idea of revolutionaries and guerrillas theres this slightly antiauthoritarian viewpoint thats crept into some of the lyrics and its some of the payoff between being surrounded by governments on one side but also were human beings with emotions and were all going to die and the stupidity of what we have to put up with every day hence the album title q magazine asked chris martin about the lyric on this song i know saint peter wont call my name the coldplay lead singer replied its about… youre not on the list i was a naughty boy its always fascinated me that idea of finishing your life and then being analyzed on it and its that runs through most religions thats why people blow up buildings because they think theyre going to get lots of virgins i always feel like saying just join a band cackles head off that is the most frightening thing you could possibly say to somebody eternal damnation i know about this stuff because i studied it i was into it all i know it its still mildly terrifying to me and this is serious drummer will champion told q magazine february 2008 that many of the tracks on the album share a theme of trying to remember whats important in your life rather than being carried away by the trappings of other things coldplay hired brian eno david bowie talking heads and u2 to produce this album xy saw the end of what the band calls oldplay and they felt they wanted to start off fresh and explore different directions guitarist jonny buckland explained to rolling stone we felt like the first three albums were a trilogy and we finished that so we wanted to do something different bassist guy berryman told rolling stone about working with eno it wasnt so much that he brings like a sound or something to it he brings lots of ideas about everything even down to like how we structured our day when this reached to top 10 of the billboard hot 100 coldplay became the first british male group to score a second top 10 hit on the hot 100 in 17 years theyd previously reached 8 with  speed of sound  in may 2005 in 1991 both jesus jones  right here right now  and real real real and the escape club wild wild west and ill be there scored their second and last us top 10 hits the album sleeve is a reproduction of eugène delacroixs painting liberty leading the people which commemorates the french revolution of 1830 the music video directed by hype williams features the guys performing in front of a blurry backdrop of the painting chris martin spoke to mtv news about this song i think everything were trying to do at the moment is about not starting again so much as breaking down what weve built up before and trying to build something different and hopefully better or worse in a good way and this song is one of our favorites because none of us are doing anything on it that weve ever done before but we really enjoy playing it the longer you go on as a band the harder it is to surprise yourself a littleknown us group called creaky boards accused coldplay of stealing this songs melody from a number they wrote in 2007 called ironically the songs i didnt write andrew hoepfner creaky boards singer

yusuf islam claimed this resembles his 1973 song foreigner suite which he recorded under his old name of cat stevens coldplay drummer will champion responded to the claims of plagiarism to hampton roadscom by claiming the band are a victim of their success said champion its tough when people accuse you of stealing something when you know that you didnt so we accept that its part of the territory and know it is only for some reason god only knows why the successful songs that seem to be the ones that are accused of being stolen so you go figure it out her added there are elements of our music that ive heard in other peoples music its interesting but a very difficult thing to define there are only eight notes in an octave and no one owns them and there are probably about 12000 songs that feature the exact same chord progression i think it lies on an intent to steal which we certainly have never done and never would so its unfortunate but its the way people are thats that were confident we havent done anything wrong this picked up the award for song of the year at the 29th annual ascap awards in london this was voted festival anthem of the year at the very first
