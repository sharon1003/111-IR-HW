home  garden maintenance  repairs why does water come out of the air vent of the dishwasher we have not used the dishwasher in a few months we ran it after a party and water comes out of that vent beside the faucets what is the reason for this happening update after a few answers i see i need to add some more details i followed the hose from the vent beside the faucets and it goes back to the dishwasher it is not going to the disposal at all i will try to clean the hose as suggested and will wait for more explainations as well follow 4 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer that is where it drains they most often use those anti siphon vents when it drains in to a disposer the vent or the drain is clogged since you said you havent used it in a while i would suspect that you have used the disposer and that makes it likely very possible the drain is plugged where it connects to the disposer if that is how it is plumbed and doesnt have its own drain first take the cap off the vent and remove the top of the vent which has clips on the side and clean that you need to do that on occasion anyway then if it isnt draining well you need to check the line between the vent and the drain which is usually in to the disposer remove the hose off the disposer and clean that out particularly where it goes in to the disposer that fitting that should take care of it good luck thor 路 9 years ago0 0 comment askers rating thor has the right answer the vent on the sink also works as an overflow in case of blockage the water has to go somewhere clean it out as recommended and it should work maru 路 9 years ago0 0 1 comment your kitchen sink drain is clogged use draino or a snake and clean it outsunnyak 路 9 years ago0 1 comment is it water or steam steam will settle making it look like water is leaking there is a difference mom of 2 great boys 路 9 years ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these get a masters degreee online need a home security safe vpn options for your computer graphic design degrees
