medical malpractice lawyers  contingency fee arrangementsby free advice staff medical malpractice attorney fees are often negotiable many lawyers will take a malpractice case on a contingency basis which means that if the case is successful the lawyer will keep a percentage of the settlement usually between 20 and 40 percent many states place a limit on the contingency percentage in medical malpractice cases most of these states use a sliding scale based on the amount of the settlement or judgment for example fees are allowed up to 33 13 for the first 300000 25 for the next 300000 and the percentage then continues to decrease as the plaintiff’s recovery amount increases billing options can be creative for example you could propose monthly bills or because your case could drag on for several years you should negotiate a tiered fee so that you pay increasing percentages as your case progresses towards trial for example you would only pay 25 if your case settles before trial 33 if it goes to trial and 40 if it goes up on appeal you could also negotiate fees based on the settlement total for example you would agree to pay your lawyer 33 13 for the first 300000 25 for the next 300000 and the percentage would continue to decrease as your settlement amount increased additionally if you demand that the advanced expenses be paid before the lawyer’s fee is calculated your recovery may significantly increase for example suppose your settlement is 500000 your medical expenses expert fees court costs and other expenses equal 100000 instead of paying the attorney a percentage of 500000 subtract the 100000 of expenses first and pay the attorney a percentage of 400000 to find an experienced medical malpractice attorney in your area go to attorney pagescom many offer free initial consultations free legal advice – get informed medical malpractice basics claims lawsuits attorneys misdiagnosis federal tort claim act←back to medical malpractice medical malpractice medical malpractice basics claims lawsuits attorneys misdiagnosis federal tort claim act state laws hospital malpractice legal malpractice nursing home abuse  neglect todays legal news ►general practicequestion mark lets james woods beat defamation suit criminal lawwhen is it libel to call someone a liar general practicepay less for drugs by asking one simple question not what you need find your legal advice
