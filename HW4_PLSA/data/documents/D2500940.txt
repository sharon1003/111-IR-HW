psychoanalysis saul mc leod published 2007 updated 2014psychoanalysis was founded by sigmund freud 18561939 freud believed that people could be cured by making conscious their unconscious thoughts and motivations thus gaining insight the aim of psychoanalysis therapy is to release repressed emotions and experiences ie make the unconscious conscious it is only having a cathartic ie healing experience can the person be helped and cured what is psychoanalysis your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  324psychoanalysis assumptions psychoanalytic psychologists see psychological problems as rooted in the unconscious mind manifest symptoms are caused by latent hidden disturbances typical causes include unresolved issues during development or repressed trauma treatment focuses on bringing the repressed conflict to consciousness where the client can deal with it how can we understand the unconscious mind remember psychoanalysis is a therapy as well as a theory psychoanalysis is commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders in psychoanalysis therapy freud would have a patient lie on a couch to relax and he would sit behind them taking notes while they told him about their dreams and childhood memories psychoanalysis would be a lengthy process involving many sessions with the psychoanalyst due to the nature of defense mechanisms and the inaccessibility of the deterministic forces operating in the unconscious psychoanalysis in its classic form is a lengthy process often involving 2 to 5 sessions per week for several years this approach assumes that the reduction of symptoms alone is relatively inconsequential as if the underlying conflict is not resolved more neurotic symptoms will simply be substituted the analyst typically is a blank screen disclosing very little about themselves in order that the client can use the space in the relationship to work on their unconscious without interference from outside the psychoanalyst uses various techniques as encouragement for the client to develop insights into their behavior and the meanings of symptoms including ink blots parapraxes free association interpretation including dream analysis resistance analysis and transference analysis1 rorschach ink blots due to the nature of defense mechanisms and the inaccessibility of the deterministic forces operating in the unconsciousthe ink blot itself doesnt mean anything its ambiguous ie unclear it is what you read into it that is important different people will see different things depending on what unconscious connections they make the ink blot is known as a projective test as the patient projects information from their unconscious mind to interpret the ink blot however behavioral psychologists such as b f skinner have criticized this method as being subjective and unscientific click here to analyze your unconscious mind using ink blots2 freudian slip unconscious thoughts and feelings can transfer to the conscious mind in the form of parapraxes popularly known as freudian slips or slips of the tongue we reveal what is really on our mind by saying something we didnt mean to for example a nutritionist giving a lecture intended to say we should always demand the best in bread but instead said bed another example is where a person may call a friends new partner by the name of a previous one whom we liked better freud believed that slips of the tongue provided an insight into the unconscious mind and that there were no accidents every behavior including slips of the tongue was significant ie all behavior is determined3 free association a simple technique of psychodynamic therapy is free association in which a patient talks of whatever comes into their mind this technique involves a therapist reading a list of words eg mother childhood etc and the patient immediately responds with the first word that comes to mind it is hoped that fragments of repressed memories will emerge in the course of free association free association may not prove useful if the client shows resistance and is reluctant to say what he or she is thinking on the other hand the presence of resistance eg an excessively long pause often provides a strong clue that the client is getting close to some important repressed idea in his or her thinking and that further probing by the therapist is called for freud reported that his free associating patients occasionally experienced such an emotionally intense and vivid memory that they almost relived the experience this is like a flashback from a war or a rape experience such a stressful memory so real it feels like it is happening again is called an abreaction  if such a disturbing memory occurred in therapy or with a supportive friend and one felt betterrelieved or cleansedlater it would be called a catharsis frequently these intense emotional experiences provided freud a valuable insight into the patients problems dream analysis according to freud the analysis of dreams is the royal road to the unconscious he argued that the conscious mind is like a censor but it is less vigilant when we are asleep as a result repressed ideas come to the surface  though what we remember may well have been altered during the dream process as a result we need to distinguish between the manifest content and the latent content of a dream the former is what we actually remember the latter is what it really means freud believed that very often the real meaning of a dream had a sexual significance and in his theory of sexual symbolism he speculates on the underlying meaning of common dream themes clinical applications psychoanalysis along with rogerian humanistic counseling is an example of a global therapy comer 1995 p 143 which has the aim of helping clients to bring about a major change in their whole perspective on life this rests on the assumption that the current maladaptive perspective is tied to deepseated personality factors global therapies stand in contrast to approaches which focus mainly on a reduction of symptoms such as cognitive and behavioral approaches socalled problembased therapies anxiety disorders such as phobias panic attacks obsessivecompulsive disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder are obvious areas where psychoanalysis might be assumed to work the aim is to assist the client in coming to terms with their own id impulses or to recognize the origin of their current anxiety in childhood relationships that are being relived in adulthood svartberg and stiles 1991 and prochaska and di clemente 1984 point out that the evidence for its effectiveness is equivocal salzman 1980 suggests that psychodynamic therapies generally are of little help to clients with specific anxiety disorders such as phobias or ocds but may be of more help with general anxiety disorders salzman 1980 in fact expresses concerns that psychoanalysis may increase the symptoms of ocds because of the tendency of such clients to be overly concerned with their actions and to ruminate on their plight noonan 1971 depression may be treated with a psychoanalytic approach to some extent psychoanalysts relate depression back to the loss every child experiences when realizing our separateness from our parents early in childhood an inability to come to terms with this may leave the person prone to depression or depressive episodes in later life treatment then involves encouraging the client to recall that early experience and to untangle the fixations that have built up around it particular care is taken with transference when working with depressed clients due to their overwhelming need to be dependent on others the aim is for clients to become less dependent and to develop a more functional way of understanding and accepting lossrejectionchange in their lives shapiro and emde 1991 report that psychodynamic therapies have been successful only occasionally one reason might be that depressed people may be too inactive or unmotivated to participate in the session in such cases a more directive challenging approach might be beneficial another reason might be that depressives may expect a quick cure and as psychoanalysis does not offer this the client may leave or become overly involved in devising strategies to maintain a dependent transference relationship with the analyst critical evaluation therapy is very timeconsuming and is unlikely to provide answers quickly people must be prepared to invest a lot of time and money into the therapy they must be motivated they might discover some painful and unpleasant memories that had been repressed which causes them more distress this type of therapy does not work for all people and all types of disorders the nature of psychoanalysis creates a power imbalance between therapist and client that could raise ethical issues fisher and greenberg 1977 in a review of the literature conclude that psychoanalytic theory cannot be accepted or rejected as a package it is a complete structure consisting of many parts some of which should be accepted others rejected and the others at least partially reshaped fonagy 1981 questions whether attempts to validate freuds approach through laboratory tests have any validity themselves freuds theory questions the very basis of a rationalist scientific approach and could well be seen as a critique of science rather than science rejecting psychoanalysis because it is not susceptible to refutation the case study method is criticized as it is doubtful that generalizations can be valid since the method is open to many kinds of bias eg little hans  however psychoanalysis is concerned with offering interpretations to the current client rather than devising abstract dehumanized principles anthony storr 1987 the wellknow psychoanalyst appearing on tv and radio 4s all in the mind holds the view that whilst a great many psychoanalysts have a wealth of data at their fingertips from cases these observations are bound to be contaminated with subjective personal opinion and should not be considered scientific references comer r j 1995 abnormal psychology 2nd ed new york w h freeman fisher s  greenberg r p 1977 the scientific credibility of freuds theories and therapy columbia

the therapist read through the notes below identify the methods the therapist is using what do you think alberts problem is a young man 18 years old is referred to a psychoanalyst by his family doctor it seems that for the past year the young man albert has been experiencing a variety of symptoms such as headaches dizziness palpitations sleep disturbances  all associated with extreme anxiety the symptoms are accompanied by a constant but periodically overwhelming fear of death he believes that he has a brain tumor and is therefore going to die however in spite of exhaustive medical tests no physical basis for the symptoms can be identified the doctor finally concludes that alberts symptoms are probably psychologically based albert arrives at the analysts office accompanied by his parents he describes his problems and depicts his relationship with his parents as rosy  though admitting that his father may be a little on the strict side it emerges that his father will not permit albert to go out during the week and he must be home by 11 pm at weekends additionally he successfully broke up a relationship between albert and a girlfriend because he thought they were getting too close in describing this albert shows no conscious resentment recounting the events in an emotional matter of fact manner during one session in which albert is encouraged to free associate he demonstrated a degree of resistance in the following examplei remember one day when i was a little kid and my mother and i were planning to go out shopping together my father came home early and instead of my mother taking me out the two of them went out together leaving me with a neighbor i felt for some reason my mind has gone completely blank this passage is fairly typical of alberts recollections occasionally albert is late for his appointments with the therapist and less often he misses an appointment claiming to have forgotten alberts dreamduring one session albert reports a dream in which his father is leaving on a train while albert remains on the platform holding hands with both his mother and his girlfriend he feels both happy and guilty at the same time sometime later after the therapy sessions have been going on for several months the analyst takes a two weeks holiday during a session soon afterward albert speaks angrily to the therapist why the hell did you decide to take a holiday with
