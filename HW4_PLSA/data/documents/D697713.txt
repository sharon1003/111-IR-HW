home design  construction framing joist layout for stronger decks framing march 20 2013joist layout for stronger decks consider span spacing and depth to build beyond code for a small upcharge by james eggert download the pdf version of this article 38778 k bhow many decks have you been on that bounce or vibrate under foot though its an uncomfortable sensation in most cases it doesnt suggest an imminent structural failure just joist spans stretched to the max the most common cause of deck collapses is the structure pulling away from the building not joist failure even a deck that meets irc requirements can be bouncy after all the code is meant to provide minimum standards for safety not for comfort for decks and the first floors of houses residential code is based on a vertical live loading people and furniture of 40 pounds per square foot psf plus a 10psf dead load the weight of the structure itself for a total design load of 50 psf in contrast a typical commercial deck say at a restaurant built to the international building code ibc is designed for live loads of 100 psf plus a 10psf dead load anyone can build a residential deck to withstand ibc commercial loads but it can be difficult to sell the extra cost of a framing package that exceeds residential code to a homeowner who doesnt understand the difference between a deck that can hold 10 people safely and one that can host a major social event with a large margin of safety fortunately there are options for building stronger decks that go beyond minimum code requirements without breaking the bank in this article i compare the strength and relative cost of several framing layouts for a deck for comparisons sake lets assume our deck measures 12 feet by 16 feet with the long side against the house lets also assume that the framing material is 2 southern pine douglas fir spans would be similar but you should verify them most deck builders would typically support the free end of a deck this size on a beam made from two 2x12s supported on three posts set 7 feet 6 inches apart a beam made from three 2x10s would also work and each piece would be lighter and easier to handle ill talk more about the placement of the beam later after i address a few possible configurations for the joists changing joist span depth and spacing has a dramatic effect on deck strength this table compares requirements at both minimum 50 psf and elevated 70 psf design loads cost estimates and framing layouts are provided for comparison only actual costs will vary for different markets spacing 2x10 joists at 16 inches instead of 24 inches oncenter provides a stronger deck at a reasonable extra cost this joist layout would not provide an adequate safety margin when a 70 psf standard is applied this joist layout cantilevered or not would withstand 70 psf loads but with a smaller safety margin and at greater expense than 2x10s 16 inches oncenter changing joist span depth and spacing has a dramatic effect on deck strength this table compares requirements at both minimum 50 psf and elevated 70 psf design loads cost estimates and framing layouts are provided for comparison only actual costs will vary for different markets joist size and spacing the key to this exercise is understanding how different combinations of joist span spacing and size affect the framings ability to withstand loads i used stru calc strucalccom engineering software for the calcuations presented here another option for determining spans is to use the span charts in the american wood councils dca609 prescriptive residential wood deck construction guide free at awcorgpublications  keep in mind that joist spacing may be dictated by the type of decking boards to be installed and how they are to be laid out while most wood and synthetic decking installed perpendicular to the joists can span 24 inches some kinds require joists to be as close as 12 inches oncenter when the decking is installed at an angle check with the decking manufacturer for this information so what joist size and spacing should you use2x10 joists at 24inch centers for our base case lets look first at what we need to meet residential code both the 2009 irc and the dca609 allow 2 southern pine 2x10s to span 13 feet 1 inch at 24 inches oncenter at a design load of 50 psf that means these joists can span the 12foot depth of the deck and the beam can be located at the perimeter nine joists will be needed for the 16foot width i prefer to double the outside joists as do some deck builders which adds 2 joists for a total of 11 but ive based the layouts and cost calculations in this article on the minimum number needed according to stru calc this system has a 20 safety margin at a 50psf load2x10 joists at 16inch centers spacing the same 2x10 joists 16 inches oncenter produces a much stronger deck the safety margin increases to about 79 beyond the minimum requirement but at what cost this spacing requires four more joists or about 44 49 more material at 16 each for the extra joists and hangers the added cost is about 72 depending on prices in your location for material only labor to cut and install them and nail up all of the connectors will also increase by about 44 wages will vary but lets say the extra cost for this closer spacing is 100 smaller joists can we meet minimum code requirements but save money by using smaller 2x8 joists at 16 inches oncenter again with the beam located at the edge of the deck while it would be cheaper than using 2x10s at the same spacing and would also meet code the deck wouldnt be nearly as strong — stru calc shows a safety margin of just 7 at a 50psf design load if we then compare that 2x8 layout with our base case 2x10s at 24inch centers we find that although the smaller joists are cheaper we would need more of them because of the tighter spacing so the material cost would increase 17 and labor would be 44 higher in simple terms the base case would be both stronger and cheaper building to a higher standard when i was a builder i built residential decks based on a 70psf design load 60psf live load plus 10psf dead load for a 12foot span beam at the edge of the deck our basecase example of 2x10s at 24 inches oncenter does not meet that standard however 2x10s at 16 inches oncenter does in fact for an additional 100 in materials and labor the closer spacing gives you a 28 safety margin compared with minimum residential loading requirements using smaller 2x8s at 16 inches oncenter does not meet this higher design load to get there 2x8s would need to be spaced on 12inch centers this would require 17 joists which increases material costs by half and nearly doubles labor this is likely too high a premium to pay unless the closer spacing was needed anyway to support angled decking shorten the span there is one more option we havent yet considered we can reduce the span to 10 feet 6 inches by moving the beam toward the house and letting the joists cantilever 18 inches this simple adjustment enables our base case — 2x10s at 24inch centers — to exceed the 70 psf design load by about 12 and for the extra 100 it would cost to switch to 16inch centers plus possibly the cost of a 16foot rim joist we achieve a safety margin of 68 you could open a restaurant with a deck that strong minimum standards serve a purpose but it isnt that much more expensive to build a deck that can handle a load beyond the minimum — allowing everybody to sleep better at night james eggert is a building inspector in new haven conn about the author james
