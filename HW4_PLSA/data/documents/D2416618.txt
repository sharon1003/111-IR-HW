if there are enough permits for the people in the group if permits are not available the application is skipped and the first choice of the next person is considered after all first choices have been considered at that preference point level the drawing will look at the first choices of hunters at the nexthighest preference point level after all the applicants’ first choices have been considered the drawing will look at everyone’s second choices this process continues in the same way for third fourth and fifth choices if you draw a generalseason buck deer permit — regardless of whether it was your first second third fourth or fifth choice — you will lose all of your preference points learn more about preference points
