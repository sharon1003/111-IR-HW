currently watching iowa get bludgeoned to death by tennessee and i cannot help but bring up the old subject of kirk ferentz how is it that this man has kept his job iowa has gone 4531 since the end of 2008 and with only one really solid season 112 in 2009 is iowa really just comfortable with being the most mediocre football team in the country theyre predictable slow undersized and just lack a lot of athleticism im sure its happening but if im a hawkeye fan im screaming for kf to be fired there is no way that iowa is going to be even close to being competitive with the way the b1g is trending how are they going to compete with harbaugh dantonio meyer kill franklin theyre not not with kf i know that its a tough place to recruit but hes not helping any is he of course i am a michigan fan but i also enjoy seeing as many b1g teams in the rankings as possible its good for the conference and even better for us the fans is there any chance that iowa takes a look at this beat down theyre getting and think its time for a change do you take a chance as the iowa ad and give kyle whittingham a call just throwing it out there guys im sure the snarks are coming just want the b1g to be as best as it can be go bluetop login or register to post comments tags mgo board comment viewing options select your preferred way to display the comments and click save settings to activate your

honestly not sure how much better theyd be with someone else sure there might be a few more highs if they get the right combination of offensive system and playmakers but iowa always fields a good

that price a cheap franchise may want the cash more than hiring the best option or they may even believe in him then they sign a risky high upside low price tag coach like stitt for the next three years and if it doesnt work in 3 years you get a clean slate and in the present at least theyre interesting again and theyre not spending any more money of course he would have to agree to tear up the

level for the next five years ferentz also receives supplemental income in the amount of 148 million per year bringing his total salary up to 355 million per season that means if ferentz were fired at the end of this year iowa would owe him 133 million to be paid in monthly installments between now and 2020 that amounts to roughly 27 million per year but one thing that’s sometimes overlooked is the cost savings that would be accrued by terminating ferentz’s contract the unpaid salary amounts to some 178 million and if ferentz is fired before the end of next january iowa would also save on 315 million in unpaid longevity incentives that brings the total savings up to 21 million in other words even after considering the buyout cost iowa would net some 77 million in savings or about 15

there were a lot of rumoring flying around about leaving for a bigger program or more likely a pro job he was a very hot coach at the time iowa went big and locked him down unfortunately for iowa they started going downhill after that iowa fans that i know are really upset about him and want him gone but due to his contract he is almost unfirable a couple years ago they did have a bad run of off the fields issues  i was surprised even with the contract that he survived but if another string of off field issues arises then i think he is gone if not i think he has about 23 years to right the ship or he is gone top login or register to post comments january 2nd 2015 at 1032 pm 81mroamer92joined 01022015mgo points 4maybe iowa needs a pinker opposing locker room loltop login or register to
