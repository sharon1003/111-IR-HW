pacman name pacman company atari model  cx2646programmer tod frye year 1981released yes notes released on ‘pacman day’ april 3rd 1982along with e t the atari 2600 version of pacman will long be known as one of the bigger disappointments in the 2600s game library at the time of its release pacman was the most popular arcade game in the world and therefore was ataris hottest license after being hyped to death for months pacman was finally released to eager 2600 fans on what was declared pacman day april 3rd 1982 the response was unanimous for pacman fans everywhere were shouting what the heck this doesnt look like pacman the 2600 version of pacman can best be described as adequate had it been any other game atari fans would have passed it off as another average at best conversion and moved on but this wasnt just any game it was pacman atari had botched the most popular game in history and for 2600 fans everywhere there was just no excuse after the months of hype the advertisements stating that no other system would have pacman and the promise of everyones favorite game coming home atari fans felt betrayed everyone wanted to know the same thing what happened to pacman and why didnt atari fix it these questions are a bit hard to answer there are many rumors floating around that have been retold so many times that theyre now considered firm facts ill attempt to address the most prominent myths here1 tod purposely botched pacman because he was already promised a huge royalty and didnt care about the quality after that2 tod had an amazing 8k version of pacman up and running by atari forced him to strip it down to fit on a 4k cartridge3 tod held the halffinished prototype for ransom until atari agreed to give him a giant royalty to finish it knowing that they couldnt find another programmer in time for the crucial chirstmas holidy as i mentioned before all three of these rumors are completely false the first rumor implies that tod got his royalty agreement before he finished pacman and didnt care about its quality this is incorrect as tod and several other atari employees started getting game royalties in order to keep them from jumping ship to other companies and didnt receive them until after pacman was done tod was also on probation at the time so he made sure that he put a lot of work into pacman the quality is due to it being his first game the second rumor sounds believable at first glance since other programmers had passed on pacman due to it having to fit into 4k but tod designed the game to be 4k from the get go there was never an 8k version the last rumor is the most oft repeated one but it too us false as pacman was released in april and never intended to be a christmas title the game wasnt finished until september far too late for christmas so why do these rumors keep circulating there are two main reasons 1 people need a reason to explain why their favorite game wasnt the best it could have been and 2 tod frye has a mystique about him as he was the programmer for a large number of unreleased games and was known to be a character around atari for this reason its not too hard to believe some of these rumors might be true it wasnt until recently that tod set the record straight when he was interviewed for the book atari inc business is fun the bottom line is that the 2600 version of pacman while adequate isnt all that good atari made much better versions of pacman for the atari 400800 5200 intellivision and colecovision under the atarisoft label but the 2600 version is the one most people remember at first pacman sold fairly well but once word of mouth got around about how bad the port was sales started to drop off to add insult to injury atari produced more pacman carts than there were 2600s in existence with the logic being that pacman would sell 2600s all by itself although its rumored that one atari exec said that people would want to buy more than one copy to keep at all their vacation homes unfortunately by the time of the crash atari literally had millions of unsold pacman carts sitting in its warehouses pacman served as a wakeup call to atari that 2600 fans wouldnt buy just anything with a popular name attached to it a lesson atari would soon learn with another little game called e t version cart text description pacman eprom cartridge final version return to 2600 software
