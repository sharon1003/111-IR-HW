ritual practices and are believed to be a means for understanding the divine a mishnaic textual source pirkei avot 323 makes clear that the use of gematria is dated to at least the tannaic period this marriage between the symbolic and the physical found its pinnacle in the creation of the tabernacle the hebrew word for symbol is ot which in early judaism denoted not only a sign but also a visible religious token of the relation between god and man it is largely held by jewish leadership that the numerical dimensions of the temple are a microcosm of creation  that god used to create the

righteous ones or lamed vav tzadikim  hebrew לו צַדִיקִים  36 righteous ones often abbreviated to lamed vav niks a refers to 36 righteous people a notion rooted within the more mystical dimensions of judaism the singular form is tzadik nistar  hebrew צַדִיק נִסתָר  the source is the talmud itself explained as follows as a mystical concept the number 36 is even more intriguing it is said that at all times there are 36 special people in the world and that were it not for them all of them if even one of them was missing the world would come to an end the two hebrew letters for 36 are the lamed which is 30 and the vav which is 6 therefore these 36 are referred to as the lamedvav tzadikim this widely held belief this most unusual jewish concept is based on a talmudic statement to the effect that in every generation 36 righteous greet the shechinah  the divine presence tractate sanhedrin 97b tractate sukkah 45b 3 the lamedvav tzaddikim are also called the nistarim concealed ones in our folk tales they emerge from their selfimposed concealment and by the mystic powers which they possess they succeed in averting the threatened disasters of a people persecuted by the enemies that surround them they return to their anonymity as soon as their task is accomplished concealing themselves once again in a jewish community wherein they are relatively unknown the lamedvavniks scattered as they are throughout the diaspora have no acquaintance with one another on very rare occasions one of them is discovered by accident in which case the secret of their identity must not be disclosed the lamedvavniks do not themselves know that they are one of the 36 in fact tradition has it that should a person claim to be one of the 36 that is proof positive that they are certainly not one since the 36 are each exemplars of anavah humility having such a virtue would preclude against one’s selfproclamation of being among the special righteous the 36 are simply too humble to believe that they are one of the 36 3the term lamedvavnik is derived from the hebrew letters lamed l and vav v whose numerical value adds up to 36 the nik at the end is a russian or yiddish suffix indicating a person who as in  beatnik  in english this would be something like calling them the thirtysix ers  the number 36 is twice 18 in gematria a form of jewish numerology  the number 18 stands for life because the hebrew letters that spell chai meaning living add up to 18 because 36  2×18 it represents two lives40  editthe gematria of the hebrew letter מ42  editletters in one of gods divine names50  editthe
