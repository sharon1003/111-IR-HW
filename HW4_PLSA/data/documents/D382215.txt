people evidence of their long occupation exists in archeological evidence found at birrigai rock shelter at tidbinbilla nature reserve in rock paintings in namadgi national park and in other places throughout the australian capital territory act when europeans settled the area in the early 1820s hundreds of aboriginals lived in the area meeting regularly for corroborees and feasts and then breaking off into smaller bands the aborigines moved about to take advantage of seasonal foods such as bogong moths which arrived in their thousands during the summer months as elsewhere in australia european settlement disrupted aboriginal patterns of land use and movement across the country and many aborigines died from europeanbrought diseases like influenza smallpox and tuberculosis aborigines continued to live in the area often working on sheep properties their numbers diminished by illness and starvation their culture and language in decline canberra a good sheep station spoiled in 1815 a road was constructed across the blue mountains to bathurst plains and by 1820 a road to goulburn plains which lie within 100 kilometres of canberra was under construction opening up the vast interior of australia to further exploration and development albert r peters sheep near old parliament house 1940s image courtesy of the national library of australia nlapican23389536 in 1820 explorers joseph wild james vaughan and charles throsby smith discovered the limestone plains of the canberra region following the discovery of lake george earlier that year they crossed the range of hills beside lake george and reached a point from which they saw what is now the site of canberra the first european settler in the district was joshua john moore who established a stock station called canberry its thought the name canberry is based on an aboriginal name for the area kamberra or kambery the middle of moores property is approximately where canberras city centre is currently sited in 1913 canberra became the official name for the area a capital city for australia subsequent to federation in 1901 the commonwealth parliament was formed the grand opening ceremony was held on 9 may 1901 in melbournes exhibition building the commonwealth parliament continued to sit in melbourne as the site of the national capital was not yet decided design of the lay out of the federal capital city of australia as projected by the departmental board 1912 image courtesy of the national archives of australia a767 1 the new south wales government commissioned a report suggesting possible locations for the seat of government for the new commonwealth of australia the report suggested three places — bombala yasscanberra and orange — which made it to a short list and suggested others which were rejected albury tumut cooma and armidale the decision for the yasscanberra option was made in 1908 by the commonwealth parliament and shortly afterwards the commonwealth surveyor charles scrivener was dispatched to choose a site his instructions were to choose somewhere picturesque distinctive and with views the australian capital territory was declared on 1 january 1911 and an international competition to design the new capital city of australia was held more than 130 entries were received in the competition and the winning entry was submitted by american architect walter burley griffin and his partner and wife marion mahony griffin the first commonwealth parliament house opened in canberra in 1927 the australian capital territory became a selfgoverning territory in 1989 the development of modern canberra walter burley griffin image courtesy of the national library of australia the griffins walter burley and marion mahony had both spent considerable time working for frank lloyd wright in chicago marion worked for him for 14 years and walter for five walter burley griffin was influenced by the city beautiful and garden city movements which influenced town planning during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was also influenced by frank lloyd wrights work particularly in the development of the prairie style which included not just the design of a house but the interiors as well including stained glass fabrics carpet and other accessories the influence of the city beautiful and garden city movements is clear in griffins plans for canberra  green bands surrounding areas of settlement wide boulevards lined with large buildings formal parks and water features there was considerable opposition to burley griffins design for canberra the argus newspaper reporting that the federal government cannot afford to throw money away  the plan is that of a landscape artist rather than an engineer  it looks as though the author of this plan  had been carefully reading books upon town planning without having much more theoretical knowledge to go upon portrait of marion mahony griffin 18711961 1935 photograph sepiatoned image courtesy of the national library of australia an23379384 king omalley who was minister for home affairs at the time bowed to pressure and a departmental board made changes to griffins design walter burley griffin was sent a copy of the changes by the departmental board griffin wasnt happy with the changes and argued that he should be in canberra to oversee the building the griffins came to australia and walter was appointed federal capital director of design and construction however like jørn utzon designer of the sydney opera house years later burley griffin had a hard time of it delays in construction led to a royal commission which in 1917 supported burley griffins position and his continued appointment supervising the work but griffin continued to be criticised and from 1920 he was no longer part of the development of canberra he continued practising as an architect in australia and was responsible for the design of the suburb of castlecrag in sydney the towns of leeton and griffith in nsw and for other buildings such as newman college at the university of melbourne marion mahony griffins role has long been regarded as secondary however it was at her urging that walter entered the design competition for the city of canberra and it was she  the worlds first licensed female architect  who was responsible for the drawings which won the competition she was a renowned draughtswoman and a talented architect in her own right in 1935 the griffins went to india and set up practice walter burley griffin died there a year later marion returned to the usa and lived to be 91 world war 1 slowed progress on the development of canberra as did the depression and world war 2 griffin originally designed the city for a population of 75000 people but in the boom following world war 2 canberra grew and now contains a population of more than 300000 old parliament house old parliament house image courtesy of the museum of australian democracy at old parliament house old parliament house opened in 1927 and served as the home of federal parliament until 1988 in canberras early years the house was the social geographic and political heart of the new australian capital over time this impressive building became synonymous with some of the countrys most important moments including australias declaration of war in 1939 and the dismissal of gough whitlams labor government in 1975 the sixty years during which old parliament house served as a working parliament were a time of enormous change for australia the country grew from an imperial dominion to a nation in its own right over that time old parliament house was the theatre in which the politics of the day were played out and momentous decisions made the significance of old parliament house today lies in its historical and social value to the australian people the house is a nationally significant museum of itself and of australias political heritage  so as well as being a popular tourist destination it is also a precious place which needs conservation canberra today today canberra has become a hub for western new south wales as well as a major tourist destination for australians and international visitors people visit the national capital because it is the seat of federal government and also because it boasts many major australian cultural organisations and important cultural landmarks like the
