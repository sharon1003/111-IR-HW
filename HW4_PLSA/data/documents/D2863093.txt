budgie breeding so you have a pair of budgies a cage and a nesting box is it really all that simple the answer is absolutely not read this article to find out what breeding budgies really entails before you do anything elsemake sure you do as much research as possible make sure any budgies you plan to breed are on a good breeding diet see below make sure you have plenty of cages for everyone this includes one cage for every pair you plan to breed a cage for newly weaned babies and ideally another cage incase of fighting or other problems make sure you know what you will be doing with the babies do not just assume you can pass them off to friends family or pet storesa budgie breeding dietfruit bananas oranges apples strawberries etc veggies carrots lettuce corn peppers etc egg foodpelletsseed mixcalcium supplements your breeding pairchoose a male cock who is healthy and is atleast 1 year old but not older than 4 choose a female hen who is healthy and is atleast 1 year old but not older than 3 12 choose a pair that is in breeding condition this means a deep blue shiny and a nice even toned cere for males and a deep brown sometimes crusty cere for females choosing a bonded pair will help ensure a shorter time until your pair begins to mate breeding cage necessitieschoose a cage that is atleast 30x18x18 smaller cages can cause fighting and other problems choose perches for the cage that are secure and of different sizes do not use a grate on the bottom of the cage if the cage has a irremovable grate place the newspaper over the grate make sure the cage has a cuttlebone and mineral block make sure the cage has atleast 23 toys for the male to play with while the female is in the nesting box nesting box  nesting materialchoose a nesting box that can be attached outside of the breeding cage choose a nesting box with a concave circle in the bottom of it choose a nesting box with a bottom that is rough and easy to grip use appropriate nesting material in the nesting box some examples of appropriate nesting material are corn cob bedding unscented pine shavings not dust  and unscented aspen shavings not dust some examples of inappropriate nesting material are finch nesting material leaves toilet paper paper towels etc egg laying  incubationwhen your hen is going to lay an egg soon she will have an increased calcium intake bigger droppings and she will develop an egg bum which is when a hens lower abdomen gets larger make sure your hen gets a lot of calcium during this time your hen should lay an egg every other day until she has completed her clutch a typical clutch is 46 eggs dont worry if your hen doesnt start incubating until the 2nd or even 3rd egg has been laid this is perfectly normal and wont harm the eggs eggs are good for 2 weeks after being laid an incubation period is about 18 days remember that this is actually from the day the hen began incubating not the day the egg was laid unless she began incubating it on the day it was laid egg binding  uterine prolapseegg binding is when a hen cant pass an egg because of lack of calcium andor lack of a healthy diet the risk of egg binding is increased when you are breeding a young hen who has not developed a mature reproductive system or a very old hen who has passed breeding age signs that your hen may be egg bound include sitting on the floor or nesting box fluffed up plucking feathers around her vent area liquid droppings and labored breathing if you notice these signs it is definitely an emergency get your hen to an avian vet immediately uterine prolapse is a when a hen doesnt have enough calcium and energy to push an egg out her cloaca which is meant to be inside her body then comes out this is more common is hens that are too young or too old to breed or are not in proper condition if this has happened to your hen she needs medical attention immediately give your hen lots of calcium until you can get her to the avian vet normally surgery is needed to help the hen hand feedingeven if you do not plan to hand feed your chicks it is still important to know how to hand feed incase a problem should arise it is a good idea to get a few lessons on hand feeding from an experienced budgie breeder or an avian vet some supplies you should have on hand ahead of time include a brooder hand feeding formula hand feeding syringes andor spoons a digital scale and a thermometer splayed legssplayed legs are caused by poor diet lack of a grippable nesting box bottom and the hen sitting too tightly on the chicks thus making giving the baby poor muscle tone and making it unable to hold up its own weight ways to prevent splayed legs include making sure the parents and chicks are a good diet and receive lots of calcium making sure the bottom of the nesting box is rough and easy to grip and if you have a small clutch one or two chicks keep an egg or two in the nesting box even if they arent fertile to help take some of the hens weight off them beak  leg deformitiesdeformities are usually caused by poor hygiene in the nesting box when a breeder doesnt clean the nesting box regularly droppings get stuck to the chicks which usually results in deformities if not taken care of properly ways to prevent deformities include cleaning the nesting box when it is dirty checking the beak face feet and legs of every chick each day and if you notice food or droppings stuck to them make sure to clean them off very gently with warm not hot water and a qtip chick abuseabuse to chicks is when a parent harms a chick usually because the parents want to start another clutch normally the female is the abuser and the male soon follows if the chicks are 3 weeks or older remove the female put her in another room where she cant be heard or seen by the male normally the male will take care of the chicks with no problems if the chicks are 2 weeks or younger removing the female is still the best option if the male doesnt begin taking care of the chicks right away hand feeding might be needed make sure the male has access to lots of food sources in order for him to raise the chicks by himself placing millet in the nesting box can also be a big help to the male parent deaththe loss of a parent can come suddenly and without reason so make sure you know how to hand feed and have the supplies available to do so if the female has passed away and the chicks are under 3 weeks you will need to hand feed until the male takes over if the chicks are older than 3 weeks the male should care for them with no problems if the male has passed away before the chicks have weaned the female should care for the chicks alone with no problems chick growth  development24 hours before a baby hatches you can hear hisher little peeps from inside the egg at 35 days old the little chick is moving around and trying to figure out where to get the best spot to stay warm with hisher mother and siblings hisher eyes are not open at this point at 69 days old the
