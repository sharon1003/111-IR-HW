references to pentecost likely refer to the jewish feast and not the christian feast which gradually developed during and after the apostolic period in the english speaking countries pentecost is also known as whitsunday the origin of this name is unclear but may derive from the old english word for white sunday referring to the practice of baptizing converts clothed in white robes on the sunday of pentecost in the english tradition new converts were baptized on easter pentecost and all saints day primarily for pragmatic purposes people went to church these days alternatively the name whitsunday may have originally meant wisdom sunday since the holy spirit is traditionally viewed as the wisdom of god who bestows wisdom upon christians at baptism in other parts of the world pentecost has other names including green sunday in the ukraine and green holiday in poland these names are derived from pentecost customs that involve taking green plants into homes and churches as symbols of new life these customs also may hearken back to the harvest festival themes of the jewish pentecost history as with the term pascha in pentecost christians borrowed a jewish term and applied it to their own festivals tertullian 3rd century knew of christian pentecost and the apostolic constitutions 4th century speak of the pentecost feast lasting a week in the western church the vigil of pentecost became second only to the easter vigil in importance eventually in the west pentecost became a sunday set aside for baptisms pentecost was not kept with an octave an 8 day celebration until a later date although now that practice has been largely abandoned for the most part pentecost is now in western churches celebrated for only a sunday traditionally the sundays between pentecost and advent have been designated sundays after pentecost however this has been dropped in the west although it continues in the east the date of pentecost is determined based on the date of easter and since western churches calculate easter differently than orthodox christians usually western and eastern christians celebrate pentecost on different dates using the western easter calculation the earliest possible date for pentecost is may 10 and the latest possible date is june 13 worship and prayer resources prayers and collects for pentecost pentecost sermon i st leo the great sermon for pentecost come upon

there with lent and epiphany  nonetheless many evangelicals are discovering the church year pentecost is a perfect time for christians of all denominations to focus on the role of the holy spirit in their individual lives and in their worshipping communities while commemorating the beginning of the church some 2000 years ago in many evangelical churches in the united states the secular mothers day holiday is probably celebrated more frequently than the ancient and revered christian pentecost feast2 is discussing the gifts and charisms of the spirit appropriate for pentecost certainly in fact many charismatic catholics emphasize pentecost as a time for personal and corporate spiritual renewal many modern catholics are suspicious of claims of miracles and spiritual gifts because materialist science has taught us that they are impossible however the church has never ceased believing in these charisms the holy spirits operations both individually and corporately in the church are often misunderstood especially in some modern protestant churches where having the holy spirit is synonymous with an adrenaline rush or histrionic behavior catholic and liturgical churches have never disavowed the works of the holy spirit nor should we cease from praying for the holy spirits guidance and illumination catholics see the holy spirit working in a variety of ways through baptism charity prayer ordination faith exorcism service etc and speaking in tongues is one of the many workings of the holy spirit and even then according to st paul one of the lesser gifts thus just because one is not dancing in the aisles at mass or speaking an unknown language doesnt mean the holy spirit is absent for catholics living ones vocation in love is evidence of the working of the holy spirit one need not be showy or emotional3 are catholics pentecostal the term pentecostal is often used as a synonym for charismatic although we must note that generally the term pentecostal refers to american christian groups founded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that emphasize speaking in tongues healings and spontaneous worship some of these groups even deny the trinity and baptize in the name of jesus catholic and apostolic christians cannot claim the title pentecostal in this sense however the word pentecostal in a generic sense just means relating to pentecost ie having the holy spirit and the church thus those who are baptized and confirmed in the church are by definition pentecostals however most selfprofessed pentecostals would deny that catholics have a claim to this
