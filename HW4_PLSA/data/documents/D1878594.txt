iso 14000 is a family of standards related to environmental management that exists to help organizations a minimize how their operations processes etc negatively affect the environment ie cause adverse changes to air water or land b comply with applicable laws regulations and other environmentally oriented requirements and c continually improve in the above iso 14000 is similar to iso 9000 quality management in that both pertain to the process of how a product is produced rather than to the product itself as with iso 9001 certification is performed by thirdparty organizations rather than being awarded by iso directly the iso 19011 and iso 17021 audit standards apply when audits are being performed the requirements of iso 14001 are an integral part of the european union s ecomanagement and audit scheme emas emass structure and material are more demanding mainly concerning performance improvement legal compliance and reporting duties 1 the current version of iso 14001 is iso 140012015 which was published in september 2015 2contents  hide 1 brief history of environmental management systems2 development of the iso 14000 series3 iso 14001 standard31 basic principles

published the worlds first environmental management systems standard bs 7750 as part of a response to growing concerns about protecting the environment 3 prior to this environmental management had been part of larger systems such as responsible care bs 7750 supplied the template for the development of the iso 14000 series in 1996 which has representation from iso committees all over the world 4 5 as of 2017 more than 300000 certifications to iso 14001 can be found in 171 countries 6prior to the development of the iso 14000 series organizations voluntarily constructed their own emss but this made comparisons of environmental effects between companies difficult therefore the universal iso 14000 series was developed an ems is defined by iso as part of the overall management system that includes organizational structure planning activities responsibilities practices procedures processes and resources for developing implementing achieving and maintaining the environmental policy 7development of the iso 14000 series  editthe iso 14000 family includes most notably the iso 14001 standard which represents the core set of standards used by organizations for designing and implementing an effective environmental management system ems other standards in this series include iso 14004 which gives additional guidelines for a good ems and more specialized standards dealing with specific aspects of environmental management the major objective of the iso 14000 series of norms is to provide practical tools for companies and organizations of all kinds looking to manage their environmental responsibilities 6the iso 14000 series is based on a voluntary approach to environmental regulation 8 the series includes the iso 14001 standard which provides guidelines for the establishment or improvement of an ems the standard shares many common traits with its predecessor iso 9000 the international standard of quality management 9 which served as a model for its internal structure 7 and both can be implemented side by side as with iso 9000 iso 14000 acts both as an internal management tool and as a way of demonstrating a company’s environmental commitment to its customers and clients 10iso 14001 standard  editiso 14001 defines criteria for an ems it does not state requirements for environmental performance but rather maps out a framework that a company or organization can follow to set up an effective ems it can be used by any organization that wants to improve resource efficiency reduce waste and reduce costs using iso 14001 can provide assurance to company management and employees as well as external stakeholders that environmental impact is being measured and improved 6 iso 14001 can also be integrated with other management functions and assists companies in meeting their environmental and economic goals iso 14001 like other iso 14000 standards is voluntary 11 with its main aim to assist companies in continually improving their environmental performance and complying with any applicable legislation the organization sets its own targets and performance measures and the standard highlights what an organization needs to do to meet those goals and to monitor and measure the situation 11 the standard does not focus on measures and goals of environmental performance but of the organization the standard can be applied to a variety of levels in the business from the organizational level down to the product and service level iso 14001 is known as a generic management system standard meaning that it is relevant to any organization seeking to improve and manage resources more effectively this includessinglesite to large multinational companieshighrisk companies to lowrisk service organizationsthe manufacturing process and service industries including local governmentsall industry sectors including public and private sectorsoriginal equipment manufacturers and their suppliers all standards are periodically reviewed by iso to ensure they still meet market requirements the current version is iso 140012015 and certified organizations were given a threeyear transition period to adapt their environmental management system to the new edition of the standard the new version of iso 14001 focuses on the improvement of environmental performance rather than the improvement of the management system itself 12 it also includes several new updates all aimed at making environmental management more comprehensive and relevant to the supply chain one of the main updates asks organizations to consider environmental impact during the entire life cycle although there is no requirement to actually complete a life cycle analysis additionally the commitments of top management and the methods of evaluating compliance have also been strengthened another significant change linked iso 14001 to the general management system structure introduced in 2015 called the high level structure both iso 9001 and 14001 use this same structure making implementation and auditing more uniform the new standard also requires the holder of the certificate to specify risks and opportunities and how to address them basic principles and methodology  editthe pdca cycle the basic principles of iso 14001 are based on the wellknown plandocheckact pdca cycle plan establish objectives and processes required  editprior to implementing iso 14001 an initial review or gap analysis of the organizations processes and products is recommended to assist in identifying all elements of the current operation and if possible future operations that may interact with the environment termed environmental aspects 13 environmental aspects can include both direct such as those used during manufacturing and indirect such as raw materials this review assists the organization in establishing their environmental objectives goals and targets which should ideally be measurable helps with the development of control and management procedures and processes and serves to highlight any relevant legal requirement which can then be built into the policy 13do implement the processes  editduring this stage the organization identifies the resources required and works out those members of the organization responsible for the ems implementation and control 13 this includes establishing procedures and processes although only one documented procedure is specifically related to operational control other procedures are required to foster better management control over elements such as documentation control emergency preparedness and response and the education of employees to ensure that they can competently implement the necessary processes and record results communication and participation across all levels of the organization especially top management is a vital part of the implementation phase with the effectiveness of the ems being dependent on active involvement from all employees 13check measure and monitor the processes and report results  editduring the check stage performance is monitored and periodically measured to ensure that the organizations environmental targets and objectives are being met in addition internal audits are conducted at planned intervals to ascertain whether the ems meets the users expectations and whether the processes and procedures are being adequately maintained and monitored 13act take action to improve performance of ems based on results  editafter the checking stage a management review is conducted to ensure that the objectives of the ems are being met the extent to which they are being met and that communications are being appropriately managed additionally the review evaluates changing circumstances such as legal requirements in order to make recommendations for further improvement of the system these recommendations are incorporated through continual improvement plans are renewed or new plans are made and the ems moves forward 13continual improvement process ci  editiso 14001 encourages a company to continually improve its environmental performance apart from the obvious – the reduction in actual and possible negative environmental impacts – this is achieved in three ways 14 expansion business areas increasingly get covered by the implemented ems enrichment activities products processes emissions resources etc increasingly get managed by the implemented ems upgrading the structural and organizational framework of the ems as well as an accumulation of knowledge in dealing with businessenvironmental issues is improved overall the ci concept expects the organization to gradually move away from merely operational environmental measures towards a more strategic approach on how to deal with environmental challenges benefits  editiso 14001 was developed primarily to assist companies with a framework for better management control which can result in reducing their environmental impacts in addition to improvements in performance organizations can reap a number of economic benefits including higher conformance with legislative and regulatory requirements 15 by adopting the iso standard by minimizing the risk of regulatory and environmental liability fines and improving an organization’s efficiency 16 benefits can include a reduction in waste consumption of resources and operating costs secondly as an internationally recognized standard businesses operating in multiple locations across the globe can leverage their conformance to iso 14001 eliminating the need for multiple registrations or certifications 17 thirdly there has been a push in the last decade by consumers for companies to adopt better internal controls making the incorporation of iso 14001 a smart approach for the longterm viability of businesses this can provide them with a competitive advantage against companies that do not adopt the standard potoki  prakash 2005 this in turn can have a positive impact on a companys asset value van der deldt 1997 it can lead to improved public perceptions of the business placing them in a better position to operate in the international marketplace 18 15 the use of iso 14001 can demonstrate an innovative and forwardthinking approach to customers and prospective employees it can increase a business’s access to new customers and business partners in some markets it can potentially reduce public liability insurance costs it can also serve to reduce trade barriers between registered businesses 19 there is growing interest in including certification to iso 14001 in tenders for publicprivate partnerships for infrastructure renewal evidence of value in terms of environmental quality and benefit to the taxpayer has been shown in highway projects in canada  citation neededconformity assessment  editiso 14001 can be used in whole or in part to help an organization forprofit or notforprofit better manage its relationship with the environment if all the elements of iso 14001 are incorporated into the management process the organization may opt to prove that it has achieved full alignment or conformity with the international standard iso 14001 by using one of four recognized options these are 13make a selfdetermination and selfdeclaration orseek confirmation of its conformance by parties having an interest in the organization such as customers orseek confirmation of its selfdeclaration by a party external to the organization orseek certificationregistration of its ems by an external organization iso does not control conformity assessment its mandate is to develop and maintain standards iso has a neutral policy on conformity assessment in so much that one option is not better than the next each option serves different market needs the adopting organization decides which option is best for them in conjunction with their market needs option one is sometimes incorrectly referred to as selfcertify or selfcertification this is not an acceptable reference under iso terms and definitions for it can lead to confusion in the market 13 the user is responsible for making their own determination option two is often referred to as a customer or 2ndparty audit which is an acceptable market term option three is an independent thirdparty process by an organization that is based on an engagement activity and delivered by specially trained practitioners this option was based on an accounting procedure branded as the enviro ready report which was created to help small and mediumsized organizations its development was originally based on the canadian handbook for accountants it is now based on an international accounting standard the fourth option certification is another independent thirdparty process which has been widely implemented by all types of organizations certification is also known in some countries as registration service providers of certification or registration are accredited by national accreditation services such as ukas in the uk iso 14001 and emas  editin 2010 the latest emas regulation emas iii entered into force the scheme is now globally applicable and includes key performance indicators and a range of further improvements as of april 2017 more than 3900 organizations and approximately 9200 sites are emas registered 20complementarities and differences  editiso 14001s ems requirements are similar to those of emas additional requirements for emas include 1stricter requirements on the measurement and evaluation of environmental performance against objectives and targetsgovernment supervision of the environmental verifiersstrong employee involvement emas organizations acknowledge that active employee involvement is a driving force and a prerequisite for continuous and successful environmental improvementsenvironmental core indicators creating multiannual comparability within and between organizationsmandatory provision of information to the general publicregistration by a public authority iso 14001 use in supply chains  editthere are many reasons that iso 14001 should be potentially attractive to supply chain managers including the use of the voluntary standard to guide the development of integrated systems its requirement for supply chain members in industries such as automotive and aerospace the potential of pollution prevention leading to reduced costs of production and higher profits its alignment with the growing importance of corporate social responsibility and the possibility that an isoregistered system may provide firms with a unique environmental resource capabilities and benefits that lead to competitive advantage research on the supply chain impact of iso 14001 registration posited that potential positive impacts might include more proactive environmental management higher levels of communication higher levels of waste reduction and cost efficiency better roi higher levels of customer relationship management fewer issues with employee health and a reduced number of safety incidents this research concluded that iso 14001 registration can be leveraged across the supply chain for competitive advantage 21list of
