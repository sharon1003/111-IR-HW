missouri answered oct 25 2012 generally speaking a tech startup which is offering convertible preferred stock will get a valuation of 9x its revenues if it chooses to offer plain equity then after a 25 liquiditysmall company discount it will get a valuation of 68x its revenues this is based on a exercise i did for a nigerian startup in august 2011 just after the euro crisis had precipitated but before the us debt ceiling vote came to a head this valuation was further ratified after discussion with multiple vcs and some tech startup founders please see the computation in attached slide for detailed computation email me at anshulsachgmailcom p s can listed stocks be used in this analysis there might be some queries about why use public listed companies in this analysis the reasons for this doubt arise from the fact that large listed companies have relatively stable topline growth rates however slower when compared to startups startups typically experience higher growth rates but have relatively volatile prospects hence plain equity in the case of large listed entities becomes comparable with convertible preferred stock for startups how the founders of a business think that their business will go great guns so they want to place a high valuation on it the prospective investors think that the startup has a dicey volatile future and may or may not be successful a convertible preferred stock is essentially a combination of plain equity plus an option to purchase at a later date now higher the volatility lower the price of the plain equity so if founders offer only plain equity to investors then investors will expect lower valuation than 9x evsales however founders will not be willing to give equity at that lower valuation given their greater confidence in the ventures success as compared to investors this is where the option comes into the picture the higher the volatility the higher the value of a buy option thus the options balance out the lower value of plain equity with this option vcs are willing to give a valuation of 9x evsales thus plain equity plus a buy option ie convertible preferred stock help in matching the aspirations of both

answered dec 9 2016 · author has 79 answers and 58k answer views in its most basic sense the multiple is a ratio value  revenue it’s an idea of how much you should price a company if you know what a company takes in revenue you multiply by a reasonable revenue multiple for any companies you can find that are kind of like it and you know what its total value should be but what kind of value and how do you price it if shares are only being issued and sold not traded as is the case in a startup that hasn’t achieved an “exit” yet ie it has raised money from investors but the investors haven’t had the chance to sell any of the stock they bought you might be tempted to go with the valuation agreed on in the most recent round of fundraising but you might be wrong for example uber is currently claiming a 625 billion valuation and investors might pour money in at that price but any investors coming in at this late stage are going to put all sorts of antidilution dividend and liquidation preferences terms on the deal meaning that they don’t really see the company as ever going public at 625b the best way to estimate a value is if you can find a multiple on a “comp exit” a comparable company that made it all the way to a buyout or ipo all the classes of stock fancy legal terms options and anything else in there confusing the issue got sold to somebody or many somebodies who liquidated it all for real money but a word about revenue why revenue earlystage companies have to lose lots of money on research and development before they start getting anywhere so we might assume most of the money they are losing is just growing pains we might assume that they are earning about the same percentage of sales on every widget they sell as every other company in the same industry so revenue is a good way to filter a health signal out of the noise but not all revenues are created equal what if you’re making a revolutionary electric car but you lose money on every unit sold perhaps you assume that with time and economy of scale you’ll bring the price down the same cynical calculus happens in xbox consoles vs playstations which pretty much always start out selling at a loss on their release date just to beat their way into the market or what if you’re selling a revolutionary ridesharing service that’s going to change the world but you lose money on every ride in order to grow volume in every city and attack the taxi industry what if you sell beautiful goods and make money on every sale but you spend twice as much money advertising to hook the customers and then after one purchase they don’t come back in those cases you can’t just suddenly stop doing rd and be a profitable company the only business you have rd’d so far loses money the more revenue you have the faster you bleed you have to spend bigger and faster in the hopes that your rd can get you somewhere before investors lose confidence and stop pouring more money in so yeah in that case a revenue multiple isnt a great indicator of value the moral of the story a revenue multiple is an ok way to value a startup if you can find a reliable way to value other companies like it and if the revenue represents a good shot at being financially healthy by the time it exits42k views · view upvoters thomas smale 7 years as broker of onlinesaa s businesses answered nov 26 2017 · author has 788 answers and 7878k answer views there’s a second equally important issue hidden in your question which needs to be addressed before we can discuss multiples to what figure should you apply a multiple when valuing a technology startup at fe international we’ve found that the ambiguity resulting from the different way “revenue” and “profit” are calculated from one company to another means that a more specific figure is needed in our experience the two most reliable values are earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and seller discretionary earnings sde ebitda is used almost exclusively for companies larger than 5m in value and is calculated by adding interest taxes depreciation and amortization back to your net income for businesses under 5m in value seller discretionary earnings sde is typically used sde is the profit left to the business owner once all costs of goods sold and critical ie nondiscretionary operating expenses have been deducted from gross income crucially any owner salary can be added back to the profit number to reflect the true earnings power of the business essentially sde can be expressed with the following simple formula this is the figure that we recommend you apply the multiple to when calculating your company’s value now that addressed this we can move on to your actual question typically a value of between 25x and 40x is applied to the sde figure although there can be exceptions to either side of this scale to determine exactly where your business falls in this range a reputable ma advisor will assist you in delving deeply the numerous relevant drivers this is an activity that is heavily dependent on industry and nichespecific knowledge as well as the capacity for research here is a short extract of the 80  100
