copyright and license information ►this article has been cited by other articles in pmc go to abstract insertion of an intravascular catheter is one of the most common invasive procedures in hospitals worldwide these intravascular lines are crucial in resuscitation allow vital medication to be administered and can be used to monitor the patients realtime vital parameters there is however growing recognition of potential risks to life and limb associated with their use medical literature is now replete with isolated case reports of complications succinctly described by garden and laussen 2004 as “an unending supply of “unusual” complications from central venous catheters” this paper reviews complications of venous and arterial catheters and discusses treatment approaches and methods to prevent complications based on current evidence and endeavours to provide information and guidance that will enable practitioners to prevent recognise and successfully treat extravasation injuries in adults go to1 definition extravasation injury is defined as the damage caused by the efflux of solutions from a vessel into surrounding tissue spaces during intravenous infusion the damage can extend to involve nerves tendons and joints and can continue for months after the initial insult if treatment is delayed surgical debridement skin grafting and even amputation may be the unfortunate consequences of such an injury  1  go to2 incidence extravasation is not as rare as many people think and it may occur even in the most closely monitored situations a study which investigated extravasation over a fiveweek period in a uk hospital established an incidence of 39 in adults almost double that of previously published reports  2  two percent of the medical defence union cases involving anaestheticrelated events between 1970–1982 excluding deaths were due to extravasation injuries  3  and for those patients who received a course of cytotoxic injections 5 experienced extravasations  4  despite this extravasation injuries remain uncommon with an estimated incidence published in the literature of between 01 and 6 in patients receiving chemotherapy  1  the published rate is likely an underestimation however as many cases of extravasation go unreported go to3 aetiology sites most often implicated in extravasation injuries include the dorsum of the hand and foot  5  ankle antecubital fossa  6  and near joints or joint spaces  7 where there is little soft tissue protection for underlying structures  8  limbs with local vascular problems such as lymphoedema may have reduced venous flow causing pooling and potential leakage of infusates around the site of cannulation  5 9  peripheral rather than central venous administration of antineoplastic agents is more likely to be associated with frequent cannulation which is a risk factor for extravasation and this should be avoided  5 7  more extravasations occur at night and often go unnoticed  10  however data from the national extravasation information service green card reporting database shows that 44 of extravasations occur between the hours of 2 pm and 10 pm 10 occur between 10 pm and 6 am and 38 occur between 6 am and 2 pm  11  inexperienced personnel may pose a higher risk particularly during cytotoxic administration there are various patient factors that contribute to the aetiology of extravasation injuries veins of people receiving chemotherapy for cancer are often fragile mobile and difficult to cannulate  12 13  patients who receive chemotherapy at the same site as radiotherapy may experience a reactivation of skin toxicity known as ‘‘recall” phenomenon  9 14 – 17  and patients who have had an extravasation and receive further chemotherapy in a different site may experience an exacerbation of tissue damage in the original site patients who have undergone radical mastectomy axillary surgery or lymph node dissection may have impaired circulation in a particular limb which reduces venous flow and may allow intravenous solutions to pool and leak out  18  diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy may not experience the pain of an infusate leaking into the subcutaneous tissues  2 13 19 20  and those who suffer from superior vena cava syndrome have persistently elevated venous pressure which again may predispose to leakage at the intravenous site  5 13  another more obvious risk is the one posed by intravenous drug users where vessels are often thrombosed and the number of accessible veins is limited but those who require repeated infusions for their medical condition may experience the same difficulties  13 21 – 23  patients with other diseases can have increased risk of extravasation injuries because of the same mechanism this reduction in venous flow and risk of leakage at the intravenous site have been observed in patients with peripheral vascular disease  13 18 20 24 25 and in those with raynauds phenomenon where arterial spasm may compromise the peripheral circulation  2 19 20  the treatment of these diseases may also represent an increased risk of extravasation injury as shown in table 1 table 1medications that may increase the risk of extravasation go to4 pathogenesis complications of peripheral venous catheters include thrombophlebitis infection and extravasation injuries thrombophlebitis from peripheral venous catheters is a relatively uncommon complication probably because the average dwell time for such devices is relatively short thrombophlebitis can be relatively benign with redness and tenderness over the course of the vein which resolves after discontinuation of the infusion or it can present as a more serious suppurative complication where bacteraemia and metastatic foci of infection occur  26  soft tissue damage following extravasation may be due to a number of factors related to the physicochemical properties of the drug or infusate the following agents have been known to cause extravasation injuries but the lists are by no means definitive the most important input that a pharmacy can have is by considering the drugs themselves and by characterising their extravasation risk it is now well documented that a number of physicochemical factors influence and usually increase the extravasation risk of individual drugs as followsability to bind directly to dnaability to kill replicating cellsability to cause tissue or vascular dilatationp h outside the range 55–85osmolarity greater than plasma 290 mosmollformulation compounds such as alcohol polyethylene glycol with extravasation injuries the degree of cellular injury is determined by the volume of the infiltrating solution and physicochemical characteristics such as p h osmolarity and degree of dissociability p ka infiltration of vasopressors such as dopamine and adrenaline produces intense local vasoconstriction and tissue ischaemia  10 27  and in contrast vasodilators may exacerbate the effects of extravasation by increasing local blood flow and enlarging the area of injury parenteral alimentation fluids antibiotics calcium potassium and sodium bicarbonate solutions also have the potential to cause severe tissue necrosis  10 28  formulationrelated parameters include the concentration and volume of the solutions to be administered unfortunately these two parameters are contradictory to each other in so far as the smaller the volume the less the likelihood of extravasation but the higher the concentration the greater the potential for damage should an extravasation occur as the most common way to decrease the volume is to increase the concentration juggling these two factors becomes more of an art than a science chemotherapeutic agents have obvious deleterious effects when extravasation occurs and can lead to more severe injury these drugs can be classified as irritants or vesicants depending on the potential for localised toxicity and tissue damage many chemotherapeutic agents may overlap the definitions of irritants or vesicants and have the capacity to act as either table 2 demonstrates this classification table 2classification of chemotheraputic agents into irritants bold vesicants italic and both irritant and vesicant normal irritants are defined as agents that produce local inflammation pain tightness or phlebitis either at the site of injection or along the vein irritants may induce local sclerosis or hyperpigmentation but do not induce tissue necrosis the symptoms of the local reaction after extravasation are typically self limiting most commonly without longterm sequelae  29  many antineoplastic cellular toxic agents asdoxorubicindaunorubicinvincristinevinblastinemitomycinpaclitaxelazathioprineacyclovirare vesicant ie produce blisters  7 9  and as well as causing immediate injury may also bind to tissue dna  30 so that the drug is continually released from dying to healthy cells resulting in a slow increase in ulcer size over time doxorubicin for example has been shown to remain in tissue for 5 months after extravasation  31 which means that the injury can present late with extensive tissue destruction  32  ulcers caused by these highly vesicant agents usually do not heal and often require plastic surgery and skin grafting  15  the full effect of the extravasation injury is not usually immediately apparent but may evolve over days or weeks early local symptoms of a vesicant extravasation resemble those of an irritant extravasation local pain erythema burning pruritus or swelling  33 34  over the course of the reaction however as tissue necrosis evolves and becomes clinically apparent progressive erythema discolouration blistering or desquamation may develop the severity of the local reaction may vary both upon the agent extravasated and upon the total dose of extravasated material the pathogenesis of the severe tissue damage that vesicant chemotherapeutic agents cause is not fully understood agents that bind to dna induce more damage than nondnabinding drugs  34 35  these agents are taken up by the surrounding cells causing progressive and prolonged local damage  35  this has particularly been suggested to be the case for the severe tissue damage seen with doxorubicin extravasation  28  additionally the significant freeradical formation of vesicant agents is suggested as a potential mechanism of the severe necrotic effect  35  in order for the extravasated compound to do damage it must move out from the initial site of extravasation  20  the fact that this movement occurs is evident when we consider that the resultant area of damage is often considerably larger than the initial physical appearance at the time of extravasation an understanding of drug or infusate cellular transport process may allow us to better predict the spectrum of damage that may be expected some forms of transport mechanism may directly cause cell death because of the rate at which they affect the local cellular environment osmotic pressure is such a factor and this is directly related to the osmolality of the administered drug osmotic pressure can cause cell death and hence tissue necrosis by cell implosion from hypertonic solutions or cell explosion from hypotonic solutions however the former of these cellular fates is by far the most common some substances have the potential to cause tissue damage by having an osmolality greater than that of serum 281–289 mosmoll  36  hyperosmolar substances such as hypertonic glucose solutions or xray contrast media draw fluid from cells resulting in cell death by dehydration whereas calcium and potassium salts cause cell death by fluid overload hypertonic solutions which contain ions and are also acidic are particularly damaging to tissues because they are capable of killing cells by precipitating cell proteins  36  calcium chloride for example has caused fullthickness skin necrosis and hypertonic saline is the most common sclerosant associated with necrosis parenteral nutrition extravasation is reported more often in children  18 and can cause skin sloughs  10 and limb contractures particularly in premature infants the p h of a substance outside of the physiological range may have an adverse effect on tissue  2 18 37 38  thiopentone and phenytoin for example are highly alkaline and have caused severe injuries including amputations  39  other agents are shown as followsacidic agents includeetomidate p h 34amphotericin p h 56while alkaline agents includethiopentone p h 105methohexitone p h 115–122phenytoin p h 12 go to5 presentation extravasation of intravenous fluids is marked initially by pain and swelling which then progresses to blanching blistering and discolouration of the skin pain is the most useful symptom to alert the administrator to the possibility of a complication induration erythema venous discolouration or swelling may be observed at the site but it is worth noting that discolouration alone may not indicate extravasation as doxorubicin epirubicin and mitozantrone have all been reported to produce this effect when administered intravenously persistent induration often progresses to a dry black eschar in 1 or 2 weeks which then usually sloughs to reveal an ulcer objective staging of extravasations is useful for quality improvement purposes and for deciding the degree of intervention required  40  go to6 recognition a summary of the signs and symptoms above is presented as follows recognition of an extravasation is throughpainerythemaswellingtendernesslocal blistering indicative of at least a partialthickness skin injurymottlingdarkening of skinfirm indurationulceration usually not evident until 12 weeks after injuryno capillary filling a white appearance with nonblanching skin indicating fullthickness skin damage note that not all of the above symptoms may be present as well as these signs demonstrated from clinical examination an awareness of peripheral factors such as attached pumps and monitoring equipment may highlight a problem earlier a reduced rate of flow may be observed when using an infusion pump and therefore close observation is necessary increased resistance to the administration once possible changes in the position of the body for example bending of wrist or elbow cannula support or bandaging have been excluded as possible causes indicates a displaced cannula and the possibility of extravasation once the alternative diagnoses have been considered and excluded and one or more of the symptoms are present the practitioner should proceed on the basis of a diagnosis of extravasation a lack of blood return from the cannula is commonly quoted as a sign that extravasation has occurred it is however the most misleading of all signs and has been implicated in a number of serious incidents if there has been extravasation injury and the cannula has become displaced the act of trying to draw back test for blood return can move the cannula back into the vein while a hole remains in the vein wall in the proximity of the cannula tip if administration recommences a larger and more significant extravasation injury then ensues alternatively the bevel of the needle can puncture the vein wall during venepuncture allowing drug to escape into the tissue whilst the lumen of the needle may still remain in the blood vessel and allow adequate blood return go to7 management treatment is determined by the stage of extravasation the nature of the infiltrating solution and the availability of specific antidotes in all cases of infiltration the intravenous infusion should be stopped promptly and any constricting bands or tapes should be removed treatment protocols for severe extravasations vary from conservative to aggressive management of the acute injury  28 39 41 42  with additional variations in wound management  10 43 44  there is no standard treatment for the acute phase of this extravasation injury however once it is detected emergency management must be taken immediately the infusion should be stopped and the intravenous cannula should be aspirated any collection or palpable effusion in the subcutaneous tissues should be drained and the limb should be immobilised and elevated above the heart level many authors prefer the conservative treatment until lesions evolve for at least 1 week  13 34 45 46  on the other hand with fullthickness skin necrosis ulcer or persistent pain many surgeons suggest early aggressive debridement because the chronicity and the nature of the wound can cause patients to suffer delayed treatment of primary disease ie carcinoma and morphofunctional damage  13 45 46  in these situations surgical intervention with radical debridement and wound coverage would be required  39  a proposed algorithm for approaching the treatment of extravasation injuries is shown in figure 1 figure 1proposed treatment algorithm individual management instructions i aspirate extravasation injuries and inject steroid hydrocortisone subcutaneously to the affected area and iv if largescale inflammation flare or fracturing along the vein has occurred  treatment of a vesicant extravasation includes immediate cessation of infusion aspiration of as much extravasated drug as possible through the stillintact catheter and attempts for the aspiration of the extravasated agent in the surrounding tissue this aspiration may help to limit the extent of tissue damage application of cold packs provides symptomatic pain relief hot packs increase local vasodilation diluting the extravasated drug cold packs should not be administered in the event of extravasation of vinca alkaloids as increased tissue ulceration has been demonstrated in animal models with the use of cold packs  47  the local application of antidotes to different chemotherapeutic agents is based on very limited data sodium thiosulfate is recommended as an effective antidote for mechlorethamine cisplatin hyaluronidase has been recommended for extravasation of vinca alkaloids  9  the mechanism of action in prevention of tissue damage is not fully understood and has not been extensively studied hyaluronidase has been suggested to act via temporary breakdown of hyaluronic acid which holds together tissue planes and subsequent facilitation of drug dispersement and dilution  48  topical application of dimethylsulfoxide dmso has been proposed to help prevent significant tissue necrosis in animal and human models the pathophysiology of the interaction is not known although freeradical scavenging and facilitation of elimination of drug from local tissues are postulated pathways of efficacy  49  procedures such as liposuction or saline flushout have been proposed through a singleinstitution series but have not been met with widespread usage  50  dexrazoxane employed for protection of anthracyclineinduced cardiotoxicity has been evaluated in animal models and demonstrated to be protective against local tissue damage and ulceration in anthracycline extravasation  51  potent freeradical scavenging effects are suggested as the mechanism of protection from tissue damage the indications for surgery in an extravasation injury patient include fullthickness skin necrosis chronic ulcer and persistent pain  13 45  when the patient has fulfilled the indication for surgery a surgical treatment is necessary as early as possible to decrease the morbidity suffering and delayed treatment of primary disease of the patient it is imperative that complete or radical excision of all necrotic tissues must be performed until the bleeding is observed and only healthy tissue is left for wound coverage some authors use the intraoperative fluorescent dye injection to detect the doxorubicin hcl in the tissue to ensure complete excision  52  immediate or delayed surgical reconstruction could then be successfully performed  13  although case reports of local interventions including glycerine chlorhexidine and dimethylsulfoxide dmso have been published for the treatment of docetaxel extravasation it is not clear whether the application of an antidote for irritant extravasation is more effective than local palliative measures  15  go to8 prevention measures to prevent extravasation include careful insertion of peripheral venous cannulae flushing with sterile saline to ensure patency and suitable dressing to prevent movement without obscuring possible swelling or erythema regular inspection of the site and regulated delivery of intravenous fluids from continuous infusion pumps usually limited to an hour at a time may prevent the inadvertent infiltration of a large amount of fluid before detection but it is helpful to remember that although occlusion alarms on infusion pumps may be set to the lowest limit possible increased pressure is not always registered  53  hyperosmolar fluids acidic or alkaline solutions or infusates with irritant or vesicant properties should be given through central venous lines if possible or should be diluted or neutralised appropriately the addition of heparin either to flush solutions or to continuous infusions has not been shown to prolong peripheral catheter patency or to reduce the incidence of infiltration or extravasations conclusively and is not recommended  54  the site for cannulation must be chosen appropriately to reduce risk of extravasation this must be in an area where the device can be introduced easily and fastened securely where it is always in view for regular inspection taking these factors into account the most appropriate site is considered to be the forearm however it has to be accepted that this is not always going to be an available area the vessels in the dorsum of the hand are probably the next most appropriate location to consider as a general rule joints and creases should be avoided as these often represent a ‘‘small” anatomical space with nerves and tendons present for slow infusion of highrisk drugs a central line or peripherally inserted central catheter picc line should be used but if administration through a peripheral cannula is necessary it is best to administer cytotoxics through a recently sited cannula after ensuring its patency with a saline flush when administering vesicants by slow intravenous injection a push into the sidearm port of a fastrunning intravenous infusion of compatible solution is recommended if administering more than one infusion sequentially the most vesicant drug should be administered first a frequent assessment of the peripheral site is required watching for signs of redness or swelling if there are any doubts concerning the patency of an intravascular catheter the infusion must be stopped pending investigation it is recommended to resite the cannula if there is any uncertainty about its patency some investigators suggest delaying the administration of antiemetics until after vesicant administration as the sedative and antiinflammatory effects of antiemetics often mask the early warning signs of extravasation and may impede the patients ability to report any sensation at the infusion site it is important to never hurry and to administer drugs slowly to allow the drug to be diluted by the carrier solution while careful assessment of the iv site is undertaken documentation of the rate of administration location and condition of site verification of patency and patients responses is advised when giving any drugs with the potential to extravasate the elimination of human error can be considered to be impossible but systems can be put in place to decrease potential risks and to avoid a ‘‘failure to rescue” scenario systems that can be used to minimise this risk include the use of good training and educational policy not only as standalone courses but importantly on a continuing educational basis go to9 prognosis local necrosis may heal with conservative management leaving minimal longterm sequelae or may progress to significant eschar formation and tissue ulceration that ultimately requires surgical debridement and further intervention with longterm morbidity for the patient ulceration after vesicant extravasation is typically marked by delayed healing morbidity may consist of cosmetic defects chronic pain or loss of function secondary to contractures or neuropathy even in the absence of ulceration of skin  48  published patient series have estimated that only approximately one third of vesicant extravasations will progress to tissue ulceration  50  repeated infusion of the offending agent even in another limb may induce a recall reaction at the site of extravasation  14  one case of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin was documented at the site of a doxorubicin extravasation 10 years previously  50  when extravasation occurs there is no certain way of predicting the pattern of damage that will ensue heckler  55 proposed clinical staging based on 1 to 4 clinical stages of the extravasation injury in stages 1 and 2 no signs of skin damage and loss are observed whereas in stages 3 and 4 the soft tissue damage is more extensive and may include skin and underlying tissue necrosis although there is little direct literature on the effect of time from occurrence to either treatment or extent of maximum injury all authors make the generalised statement that the sooner an extravasation injury is treated the better the outcome and the smaller the affected area however our ability to define and characterise the mechanism and rate of movement of individual compounds in the subcutaneous tissues will allow us to better predict the extent of extravasation injuries go to10 discussion the consequences of iatrogenic injuries such as those from extravasation are potentially limbthreatening and have severe ongoing consequences for the patient prevention as always is better than cure but despite our aim to eliminate errors such as these from our hospitals the data on incidence suggests that an approach to management needs to be clarified there are many factors influencing the pathophysiology of the condition including those that the patient carries and those of the offending infusate indepth knowledge of these factors allows a tailored approach to treatment the initial management of extravasation injuries as outlined in figure 1 reflects current practice in the field and provides a foundation on which to add more invasive treatments a knowledge of the causative agent is crucial as is an awareness of the potential for the introduction of an antidote drug as with any iatrogenic injury communication with the patients and their relatives is the key for maintaining trust a firm grasp of the options for management and the current evidence for such choices alongside an appreciation of the potential progression of the injury and the prognosis for the patient aids this process in adults early first aid and inclusion of the plastic surgery team for specialist advice of benefit the type of offending agent volume extravasated and various patient factors influence the type of treatment that is required this intricate mix of factors makes it difficult to accurately predict the progression of the injury and therefore the most appropriate treatment it is the senior authors approach to perform early surgery in the presence of skin ulcers fullthickness skin necrosis and persistent pain regular review is advised until healing is achieved this approach then allows for reconstructive surgery to follow allowing repair of the defect and restoration of function go to11 conclusion extravasation injury is very dangerous it increases morbidity causes delayed treatment of the primary disease and has longterm sequelae prevention is better than cure but where extravasation injury does occur in adults the authors preferred method is one of theearly surgical interventions with regular followup for the consideration of reconstructive surgery go to references1 mac cara me extravasation a hazard of intravenous therapy drug
