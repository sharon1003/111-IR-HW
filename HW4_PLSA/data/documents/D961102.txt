typically place the zikaspreading mosquito cnn in fall 2012 mosquito biologist andy lima received a call from an old college friend desperate for help his washington apartment had become infested could lima come over all my friends know im the bug guy said lima whose passion for entomology is evident in his you tube channel ento geek his 2009 live rendition of six legs dont stand a chance at the virginia mosquito control association is particularly moving six legs dont stand a chancelive  the vmcayour browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  346lima gathered his materials and set out for his friends apartment on capitol hill where he fully expected to meet with asian tiger mosquitoes or aedes albopictus a common mosquito in the washington area but what lima discovered was a mosquito species that had no business being in the nations capital one that could have ramifications for the spread of the zika virus when he cupped one of the bugs in his hands he noticed it didnt have the characteristic albopictus white stripe down its back instead the stripes were in a violin shape thats the telltale sign of aedes aegypti the tropical bug responsible for spreading diseases like yellow fever dengue fever chikungunya  and zika virus but this was washington d c in october even in the summer the centers for disease control and preventions own map of mosquito distribution shows aegypti dont tend to be found much farther north than a southern sliver of tennessee i thought this cant be right  lima said maps of u s aedes aegypti distribution are incomplete a cdc official said who knows where else it is the entomologist who works in pest control figured it was a fluke perhaps mosquito eggs stuck to an object that had been brought in from a tropical area with a lot of aegypti but then lima found aegypti bugs and larvae in several more locations a fountain that had stopped flowing in his friends backyard and a birdbath and trash can about a block away as winter arrived lima figured that would be the end of this mysterious collection of aegypti mosquitoes but still curious he returned to the area a year later and found more aegypti then he found them again in 2013 2014 and 2015 mosquito biologist andy lima found aedes aegypti mosquitoes living in washington d c were the mosquitoes dying each winter  as one would expect with a tropical bug  and a new batch arriving from tropical climates each year or was it all the same family of bugs that had somehow managed to survive a washington winter lima couldnt answer that question on his own so he sought out david severson at the university of notre dame whose lab specializes in mosquito genetics severson found that limas collection of mosquitoes shared the same genes this indicated the bugs were surviving the winter and breeding perhaps by going to underground areas like metro subway stations i was really blown away said severson a professor of mosquito genetics and genomics at notre dame lima and severson published their findings in the american journal of tropical medicine and hygiene in 2015 if i had just told people that these mosquitoes had overwintered in washington d c they wouldnt believe me severson said those mosquitoes shouldnt have been there marcus williams a spokesman for the washington department of health said measures are being looked at to include testing for the zika virus in mosquitoes lima said his discovery raises the question of whether other northern u s cities could have populations of aegypti its really weird that its here so who knows where else it is he said what we dont know about mosquitoes aegypti mosquitoes are the primary vehicle  or vector in scientific parlance  for spreading zika the virus that has been associated with the neurological birth defect microcephaly and with guillainbarre syndrome severson said his study is yet more evidence of how resilient these mosquitoes are but even so he said he doesnt think the bugs lima found will likely spread zika in a significant way theyre a very small population and very isolated and theyre not going to take over washington d c he said join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter scott weaver scientific director of the galveston national laboratory agreed but he said what he does find disturbing is that even in the southern united states where aegypti thrive public health authorities dont know much about where they are and where they arent unless there is a wellfunded mosquito control program present we have very few data on the presence or absence of these vectors he wrote in an email to cnn the maps are incomplete added dr stephen waterman director of the dengue branch at the cdc there arent enough mosquito control agencies in the united states doing thorough and comprehensive surveillance so the maps have holes holes he said arent good when youre trying to track down and kill an incredibly resilient  and incredibly harmful  type of mosquito content by lending tree pay off your house with this
