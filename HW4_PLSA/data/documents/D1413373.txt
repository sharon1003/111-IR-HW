functions of the respiratory system air distributors gas exchange warms filters and humidifies air sound production specialized epithelium of the respiratory tract used for smell regulation of ph these are the two parts of the respiratory system upper tract and lower tract what is included in the upper respiratory tract nose paranasal sinus nasopharynx oropharynx laryngopharynx what is included in the lower respiratory tract trachea brachial tree including alveoli lungs these are the accessory structures to the respiratory sytem oral cavity rib cage diaphram what are the two parts of the nasal system external and internal this separates the nasal cavity from the oral cavity palatine bones when the palatine bones are not completely closed what is that called cleft palate what separates the nasal cavity from the cranial cavity cribiform plate this divides the nasal cavity into left and right sides nasal septum why is the nasal septum prone to bleeding there is a rich supply of blood vessels there this is the anatomical name for the nostrils anterior nares what type of tissue is common in the repiratory tract pseudostratified cilliated columnar epithlieum rich in goblet cells what do the goblet cells do make mucus name the four nasal sinuses and tell where they are located frontal above each eye maxillary in the maxillary bone ethmoid in the ethmoid bone and sphenoid in the sphenoid bone what is a sinus it is an air sac in the bone which lightens the skull and is a resonating chamber this is another name for pharynx throat what are the three divisions of the pharynx the naso pharanx oropharynx and the laryngopharynxthis is another name for the adnoids pharyngeal tonsils what we think of as tonsils are anatomically called what palatine tonsils what are the two functions of the pharynx pathway for food pathwaary for respiratory air affects phonation changes shaped to produce vowel soundsthis is the lid covering the throat epiglottis what doe sthe length of the vocal cord have to do with the pitch the longer the vocal cord the deeper the voice what is the adams apple thyroid cartilage why is the adams apple more apparant in men it is larger in males and if has less of a fat pad over it in males another name for the windpipe trachea what is used to dislodge something stuck in the trachea heimlich maneuver an incision made through the anterior tracheal wall in order to allow a person to breathe is called a  tracheostomy the nose is made up of what type of tissue cartilage what is the purpose of olfactory receptors they are responsible for the sense of smell this is the name of the lining of the respiratory tract respiratory mucosa these are enzymes in the mucus that destroy the bacteria chemically lysozyme enzymes tiny hairs that moves mucus to the back of the throat where it can be swallowed and digested by stomach juices cilia these are course hairs just inside the nose vibrissae what are the three chonchas superior choncha middle choncha and inferior choncha what is the purpose fo the choncha to increase air turbulance so that air swirls and inhaled particles are deflected to mucus coated surfaces where they are trapped and prevented from reaching the lungs what is a deviated septum when the septum is not in the midde of the nasal cavity can interfere with breathing and may need to be surgically repaired this is the technical name for a nosebleed expstaxis the area where the palate is supported by bone is called the  hard palate the part of the palate that is supported by muscle is called the  soft palate why does the cribiform plate have holes in it to allow the branches of the olfactory nerves to enter the cranial cavity the fact that the cribiform plate has holes in it can be dangerous why infectious material can pass from the nasal cavity into the cranium and surround the brain what is the purpose of a sinus to lighten the skull and act as a resonating chamber for speech these are the ducts that drain tears from the eyes and they empty into the nasal cavities nasolacrimal ductsinflammation of the nasal mucosa is called  rhinitis what lines each paranasal sinus repiratory muosa this is the name for sinus inflammation sinusitis what is the function of the pharynx serves as a passageway for air and food this is the name for the opening at the back of the nasal cavity posterior nasal aperature tubes that drain the middle ear and open into the nasopharynx pharyngotympanic tubes the technical name for an ear infection is  otitis media this is the name of the tonsils that are found at the base of the tongue lingual tonsilsinflammation or infection of the pharynx is called pharyngitis this is known as the voice box larynx if anything other than food enters the larynx what reflex is triggered the cough reflex this is the name fo the true vocal cords the vocal folds what determines the pitch of our voice the diameter length and tension of the vocal folds the opening between the vocal folds is called the  glottisinflammation of the mucous lining of the larynx is called  laryngitislaryngitis can progress into what condition which makes it difficult for children to breath croup why can upper respiratory infections easily spread and progress into sinusitis or ostits media because the upper respiratory mucosa is continuous with the mucus lining of the sinuses eustachian tube middle ear and lower respiratory tract this is also known as the windpipe trachea the trachea is made up of hyaline cartilage that is what shape cshaped why is the trachea reinforced with cshaped hyaline cartilage it helps to keep the trachea patent or open during pressure changes of breathing is the closed portion of the cshaped cartilage on the anterior or posterior side of the body anterior why does the open portion of the c shaped catilage need to be posterior so the esophogus can expand into the trachea if needed what maneuver should be performed to remove objects from the trachea heimlich maneuver when should the heimlich maneuver be used it should only be used if the person cant talk or make a sound or if they cant cough in some cases a surgical opening of the trachea is done so air can reach the lungs this is called a  tracheostomy the name of the incision used in a tracheostomy is called a  tracheotomy what affect does smoking have on cilia it paralyzes it and destroys them this causes mucus to build up in the lungs and accounts for the smokers coughat the lower end of the trachea it divides into two tubes called the   primary bronchi the lungs occupy most of the  cavity thoracic the heart occupies the  mediastium what part of the thoracic cavity are occupied by the lungs the plueral cavity the anterior part of the lung that is near the clavicle is called the  apex the inferior portion of the lung rests on the diaphram and is called the  base what protects the lungs both anteriorly and posteriorly the ribs each lung is divided into lobes by  fissures how many lobes does the left lung have two separated by a horizontal fissure how many lobes does the right lung have three separated by a horizontal and a transverse fissure what covers the surface of the lungs the pulmonary visceral pleura what lines the thoracic cavity the pulmonary parietal pleura what fils the area between the walls of the thoracic cavity pleural fluid what keeps the pleural layers from being pulled apart surface tensioninflammation of the pluera is called  pleurisy what are the two causes of pleurisy 1 plural surfaces become dry and rough resulting in friction and stabbing pain 2 the pleura may produce excessive amounts of fluid which exerts pressure on the lungs the primary bronchi branch off into the  bronchi secondary secondary bronchi branch into  bronchi tertiary bronchioles lead to the respiratory zone where gas exchange takes place terminal this is the site of gas exchange respiratory membrane each stem represents the  duct alveolar each cluster of grapes represents the alveolar  sac each grape represens an  alveolusalveolar  connect neighboring air sacs pores what is the purpose of alveolar pores they provide alternate routes for air to reach alveoli whose feeder bronchioles have been clogged by mucus or have become blocked what covers the external surface of the alveoli pulmonary capillaries the alveolar and capillary walls have fused  membranes that form the respiratory membrane where gas exchange takes place basement gas crosses the respiratory membrane through the process of  diffusion what do alveolar macrophages do they pick up bacteria carbon particles and other debris what type of cells produce surfactant chunky cuboidal cells what is the purpose of surfactant to keep alveoli from sticking what are the four events of respiration pulmonary ventilation external respiration respiratory gas transport and internal respiration the moving of air into and out the lungs which we refer to as breathing is called  pulmonary ventilationgas exchange between pulmonary blood and alveoli is called  external respirationtransport of oxygen and carbon dioxide via the bloodstream is called  respiratory gas transport volume changes in the thoracic cavity lead to  changes pressure the process of breathing in is called  inspiration the process of breathing out is called  expiration when you breath in what does the diaphram and intercostal mucles do they contract what happens to the size of the thoracic cavity when you breath in it becomes larger which decreases pressure and air fills the lungs inspiration will continue until the intrapulmonary pressure  the atmospheric pressure equals expiration is a  process which means it does not require energy passive what causes air to flow out of the lungs during expiration a decrease in intrapulmonary volume causes an increase in pressure the pressure in the thoracic cavity is greater than the atmospheric pressure so air flows out of the lungs when does expiration become an active process requiring energy if passageways are narrowed by spasms of bronchioles as in asthma or clogged with mucus as in chronic bronchitis or pneumonia how does forced expiration occur by contracting the intercostal muscles to depress the rib cage what is intrapleural pressure normal pressure with the plural space it is always negative which keeps the lungs from collapsing if the intraplural pressure becomes equal to atmospheric pressure what happens to the lungs they immediately recoil and collapse this is the technical name for a collapsed lung atelectasis what would cause intraplerual pressure to become equal to atmospheric pressure a chest wound which causes air to enter the pleural space what is pneumothorax the disruption of teh fluid bond between the pleurae what are nonrespiratory reflexes that cause the movement or air or gas cough or sneeze crying laughing hiccup yawn the amount of air that is moved normally on each breath is called  tidal volume what is a normal tidal volume 500 ml of air with each breath what factors affect your respiratory capacity a persons size sex age and physical condition the amount of air that can be taken in forcibly over tidal volume inpiratory reserve volume what is a normal amount for inspiratory reserve volume 21003200 ml the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled expiratory reserve volume the amount of air left in the lung after expiration residual lung volume why is residual lung volume important it allows gas exchange to continue even between breaths the total amoung of exchangeable air is called your  vital capacity what makes up your vital capacity your tidal volume inspiratory reserve volume and your expiratory reserve volume this is where air remains in a conducting zone and never reaches an alveoli it is where gas exchange could take place but doesnt physiological dead spaceair that actually reaches the respiratory zone is called the  volume functional what measures respiratory capacities a spirometer why is measuring respiratory capacity important it is useful in evaluating losses in respiratory functioning and helps in following some diseases what are the two recognizable respiratory sounds that can be heard with a stethoscope bronchial sounds and vesicular breathing sounds these are sounds that are produced by air rushing through the trachea and bronchi cronchial sounds these are the soft sounds of air filling alveoli vesicular breathing sounds this is teh actual exchange of gases between the alveoli and the blood external respiration the gas exchange process that occurs between the systemic capillaries and teh tissue cells internal respiration this is the name of pulmonary gas exchange external respiration what two things happen in external respiration oxygen is loaded into the blood and carbon dioxide is unloaded out of the blood the alveoli always have more  than the blood more so pulmonary capillary blood gains oxygenblood returning from tissues has a higher concentration of  than air in the alveoli higher pulmonary capillary blood gives up  to be exhaled carbon dioxide blood leaving the lungs is oxygen rich and  poor carbon dioxide how is oxygen transported in the blood most attaches to a hemoglobin to form hb o2 oxyhemoglobin but a small amount is dissolved in the plamsa how is carbon dioxide transported in the blood most is transported in the plasma as bicarbonate ion hco3 but a small amount 2030 is carried inside red blood cells on hemaglobin but at different binding sites than those of oxygen for carbon dioxide to be diffused out of blood into the alveoli it must be released from its  form bicarbonate form bicarbonate enters rbc combines with h ions forms carbonic acid h2co3 carbonic acid splits to form water and co2 carbon dioxide diffuses from blood into alveoli inadequate oxygen delivery to body tissues is called  hypoxia during hypoxia the skin can take a bluish color that is called  cyanosis what conditions can cause hypoxia anemia pulmonary disease impaired or blocked blood circulation this is an oderless colorless gas that competes with oxygen for the same binding sites on hemoglobin carbon monoxide hemoglobin binds more easily with  than with oxygen carbon monoxide exchange of gases between blood and body tissues is called  respiration internal what is the loading and unloading that takes place during internal respiration carbon dioxide diffuses out fo the tissue into the blood called loading oxygen goes from the blood into the tissues called unloading what enzyme speeds up the process of carbon dioxide entering the blood and combining with water to form carbonic acid carbonic anhydrase activity of respiratory muscles is transmittd to and from the brain by phrenic and  nerves intercostalneural centers that control the rate and depth of breathing are located in the  and the  medulla and pons what sets the basic thythm of breathing and contains a pacemaker called the selfexciting inspiratory center medulla what smooths out the respiratory rate pons this is the term that refers to normal respiratory rate eupnea how many breaths per minute is considered normal 1215this is an increase in respiratory rate often due to extra oxygen needs perpnea what are some nonneural factors that can influence respiratory rate and depth increased body temperature exercise talking coughing volition conscious control emotional factors chemical factors such as co2 levels chemical factors such as oxygen levels homeostatic imbalance hperventilation and hypoventilation what is the most important stimulus that causes us to breathe the bodys need to rid itself of co2what happens to the ph level of the blood as levels of carbon dioxide increase it becomes more acidic or has a decrease in ph what happens to the rate and depth of breathing as carbon dioxide levels increase breathing rate increases and becomes deeper where in the body are the chemoreceptors that monitor changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide levels they are located in the aorta and the common carotid artery in people who retain carbon dioxide such as emphysema chronic bronchitis or chronic lung diseases the brain no longer recognizes increased levels of carbon dioxide as important what becomes the respiratory stimulus dropping oxygen levels what would happen if an emphysema patient was given a high level oxygen they would stop breathing because their respiratory stimulus low oxygen levels would not be there to simulate breathing this results from increased co2 in the blood acidosis hyperventilationperiods of cessation of breathing is called  apnea this results when blood becomes alkaline hypoventilation breathing becomes slow and shallow what is the term for labored breathing dyspnea this is a disease exemplified by chronic bronchitis and emphysema copd chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasedisease where mucosa of the lower respiratory passages becomes severely inflamed chronic bronchitis disease characterized by shortness of breath and an inability to tolerate physical exertion emphysema what causes the shortness of breath that is characterized in emphysema it is caused by the destruction of respiratory exchange surfaces this loss of alveoli and bronchioles is permanent and is usually linked to inhalation of toxic vapors and cigarette smoking what is the most effective treatment for lung cancer removal of the diseased lung lobe what is the main cause of infant respiratory distress syndrome surfactant has not been produced yet and alveoli collapse this is the most common lethal genetic disease in the united states cystic fibrosis what are signs of cystic fibrosis oversecretion of thick mucus digestion is impaired due to increased mucus which clogs ducts sweat glands produce an extremely salty perspiration what happens to the rate of respiration throughout the course of ones life it decreases what is sudden infant death syndrome when an apprently healthy infant stops breathing and dies during their sleep what are common triggers for an asthma attack dust mites dog dander fungus humidity cold strong olders smoke this was the number one cause of death in 1906 tuberculosis how is tuberculosis transmitted it is an airborne disease and is highly contagious which segments of the population are at the highest risk for tuberculosis hispanics african americans new immigrants prison populations hospital employees and aids patients what is the treatment for tuberculosis long term antibioticsdisease caused by inflammation of the lower respiratory tract and is characterized by high fever chills headache cough and chest pain pneumonia what effects are seen in the respiratory tract due to aging elasticity of the lungs decreases vital capacity decreases blood oxygen levels decrease stimulating effects of carbon dioxide decrease sleep apnea becomes more common and they become more at risk for respiratory tract infections due to many of the respiratory systems protective mechanisms becoming less efficient this activity was created by a quia web subscriber learn more about quia create your own activities
