enemy spawnernavigation search author corrupted heart contents  hide 1 info2 set up3 spawnercs4 aiinfo this allows you to spawn enemies based on enemy level and so on best way to see how it works is to try it out on an object set up in order to use this correct you need a few things set up create a tag spawner create an empty game object apply the tag spawner to it create a child game object to the spawner one add spawnercs to the new child object  these will be your actual spawn pointsappend the ai part below to your ai script add enemy prefabs to the spaces provided or just add one select the enemy level you want provided there is a prefab for it set the style of spawn and time ect spawnercs  filename spawnercs author garth corrupted heart de wet mydeathofme atgmail dotcom website www
