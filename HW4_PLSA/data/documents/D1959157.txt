treats them in different ways torts a tort is a wrongful act that injures or interferes with anothers person or property a tort case is a civil court proceeding the accused is the defendant and the victim is a plaintiff the charges are brought by the plaintiff if the defendant loses the defendant has to pay damages to the plaintiff crimes a crime is a wrongful act that the state or federal government has identified as a crime a criminal case is a criminal proceeding the accused is also called a defendant the victim is the person who has been hurt or the state of georgia or other governmental entity the charges are brought by the government if the defendant loses the defendant must serve a sentence a fine is paid to the government and there is possible restitution to the victim the state has made selling heroin event 1 a crime mary would be prosecuted for this crime in a criminal proceeding by a district attorney representing the people of the state if found guilty mary could be fined and sent to jail the victim of a crime is not a party to the legal action jack would not be suing mary rather he would be one of several witnesses for the state in the case against her in court tort cases are heard in civil proceedings the legal process is quite different from criminal proceedings the civil process provides a legal means for victims of harmful acts to be compensated for the harm done to them event 2 is a tort mrs frayle has been injured by steves act in order to recover money for the harm or damage she has suffered the civil process requires that mrs frayle sue steve furthermore she must bear the cost in terms of time energy and money for doing so in such a legal action the victim of the tort is usually called the plaintiff the plaintiff begins a court action against the alleged or supposed wrongdoer usually called the defendant or tortfeasor in event 2 mrs frayle would be the plaintiff steve would be the defendant to win a tort case the plaintiff must prove two things 1 the defendant committed the tort and 2 as a result of the tort the plaintiff or the plaintiffs property was injured if a plaintiff like mrs frayle can prove both she is entitled to recover money damages from the defendant to compensate for the injury the defendant steve is liable which means he is responsible for paying the damages the same act may be both a crime and a tort event 3 is an example of an act that is both a crime and a tort linda may face a criminal action by the state and a civil action by beth the individual who was injured why are two different legal actions against one wrongful act possible in effect criminal law provides a way of punishing people who commit crimes it acts to protect all citizens from such wrongdoing criminal law is not concerned with the individual victim the law of torts on the other hand provides a way to compensate victims of wrongful acts in reality victims of crimes like burglary rape and armed robbery rarely sue the wrongdoers primarily for practical reasons for instance if the wrongdoer has no money or property from which to collect a lawsuit would accomplish nothing  excerpted from an introduction to
