ive waited a week before publishing this i promised someone i would and besides the hurt was in another constituency and i write on foreign policy now but in the end i just cant not write about andrew fisher the cut just cuts too deep so here is my take the grounds for real concern over andrew fishers appointment as head of policy are different to those that have been reported perhaps they are more profound perhaps less  but this is from inside the labour party and from all of us who fought hard through the 2015 election and when the exit polls came out died a little while labour hearts broke and labour campaigners prayed that ed balls would hold on and labour activists shook their heads at the thought of a heart of labour constituency handed to the tories fisher thought it was funny at 1235am on the morning of the 8th may those of us who had worked so hard were at last starting to understand that the best of us would fail and the best of us would fall we were learning that we would never form a government and that for five years the tories would govern unchecked and they would govern against everything we had fought for it was around 1235am that for the first time that someone told me that ed balls seat wasnt safe and it was at 1235am that fisher tweeted that it was fitting that the architect of labours miserable austeritylite economic policy should fall wait what ed balls was our shadow chancellor he was a fine constituency mp and endlessly kind to a scruffy little ppc from the midlands and a great man in the labour party and none of that matters a damn because the central duty  almost the only thing that we really ask of people joining the labour party  is that labour backs labour if youre labour care if youre labour work if youre labour back labour candidates  whether they are the shadow chancellor or a council candidate in a byelection if youre labour dont think youre bigger than labour in labour were cooperative we band together because it makes us stronger and it helps us to fight for the values that labour stands for and in which we all believe it doesnt matter what percentage of support you personally are prepared to accord to labours 2015 economic policies because those policies were arrived at properly and thoughtfully and through a formal process and that process is central to everything we are when i noticed the time stamp on fishers message i couldnt believe it and judging by the response when i pointed it out neither could the other labour people out fighting for us  believing in us  through the 2015 election the main comment i got back i was in tears the only people i knew who were celebrating at that point were tories well yeah it has been six months since that night six easy months in which fisher has moved from eagerly anticipating the downfall of a labour shadow chancellor to being appointed as head of policy for the party that others worked and mourned for and dont get me wrong the rule on labour backing labour is not the only one that fisher broke the evidence rolls on it wasnt just that he didnt back ed balls or that he did back the class war candidate or that he backed the greens or that he defined himself as part of a left that he argued should back tusc or swp or frankly abl  anyone but labour  when abl meant tory and abl meant cuts to tax credits and more cuts and swingeing changes to disability support and all of the things that andrew fisher said he stood against its how he expressed himself during the campaign youve seen the footage fisher  knowing full well that he was being filmed  saying that he had very violent bloody nightmares fantasies possibly about hitting excabinet minister james purnell it was for that film discovered by the sun that fisher was  eventually  placed on administrative suspension he continues to carry out his duties in jeremy corbyns office why because purnell wasnt left enough for fishers taste this is the dark side of the hard left  the virtue signalling the scramblingup of moral virtue and violence of feeling it happens in the corners of every political party in the heat of their obsession people boil down to the hardest of their principles they make speeches and they win applause and they spend more time with those who applaud them and then they make stronger speeches to win greater applause and are used by others and in the end they are rewarded with jobs contingent on pushing the boundaries that little bit further  reupping the game in a world where strength of feeling is the test of virtue and then they go on camera and say how they could barely manage not to punch a colleague and they get another round of applause and a cookie i knocked on nearly 20000 doorsteps during the three year run up to 2015 i also believe the books should add up do you want to punch me now or later i feel sorry for andrew fisher i think he is young and hotheaded and has never stopped to think about where his politics take us i think hes won every job he has ever had on the basis of being one of labours intemperance movement i dont think this is wholly his fault but the result of labours failure to shine a light on these dark corners of ours rather than to trap people within them theres no doubt that if the rule book is applied fishers membership should be rescinded over the last few days a startling number of people have argued that the rules could just be set aside that because fisher has the favour of labours leaders they ought not to count the rules count they matter they matter because every one of us who stands for labour or works for labour or goes out and campaigns for labour  or talks for labour or donates to labour or most importantly of all  votes for labour we are part of one party standing on a shared manifesto and we do so  we value that discipline because it is the only way to win and to effect meaningful change when people put their cross by the labour rose they know what they are getting they arent getting maybe a bit of green a dash of tory and touch of the candidates prejudice they arent getting tusc or respect or stop the war they arent getting people who are labour only when it suits they are sharing the great understanding set out at the front of the rule book that by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone common endeavour common care the exit poll was bad but for labour campaigners like me it was the election result in morley and outwood that broke us you may feel differently about ed balls what matters is that he was our man at the time when labour hearts were breaking if thats so then i dont see how andrew fisher can be labour i dont see how he can have campaigned had complex loyalties exercised discipline made sacrifices cared  all the things that labour campaigners do  and laughed as ed balls fell that is the meaning of everything in the rule book our values and our labour commitments together if you are on our team you wear our colours and your heart breaks with ours in sadness and after a weeks reflection this is why andrew fisher should go because if his heart isnt with labour he shouldnt be at the heart of labour
