tom clancys ghost recon wildlands review advertisement why we’re crushing on ivy hard a look back at five years of ps4 are mobile games finally worth playing what happens when the bitcoin bubble bursts more special features infinite resources further into the game especially when you have multiple skill points and few resources fast travel to the villa verde alpha rally point in the villa verde region in solo mode cannot be done in coop mode you will need an emp drone preferably level 2 or 3 you will also need the grenade launcher skill and attachment on your weapon you can still do this without the emp drone and grenade launcher but it will be more difficult and time consuming as soon as you spawn at the villa verde alpha rally point open your map to see the nearby 5000 resource convoy east of villa verde alpha it will have one of the four resources and cycles often mark the convoy and the following checkpoint on the map then grab a motorcycle and quickly drive to the marked checkpoint drive through the river and park at the end of the fork in the road hiding behind the trees quickly switch your weapon to the grenade launcher and deploy the emp drone hit the middle of the convoy with the drone to stop it making sure to not get spotted by the enemies as you are using the drone while hiding behind the trees next shoot three grenades into the front and back vehicles to destroy them run up to the middle vehicle and kill the passenger and driver with bullets from your weapon tag the supplies to complete the side mission and get 5000 resources if done correctly all the enemies will be dead and you can fast travel back to the villa verde alpha rally point since you are in solo mode the world will reset and the supply convoy will respawn repeat this process as many times as desired to get an unlimited amount of resources the entire process should take between 145 to 2 minutes each time you can get between 150000 to 170000 resources per hour depending on your efficiency note make sure to meet the convoy at the fork in the road if you meet them further up the road there is a nearby base where enemies will keep respawning from and hunting you until you escape which adds more time to the process additionally this exploit can be done at any convoy side mission around the map ghost recon wildlands  resource farming  convoy boosting method  150000

lure and flashbang skills a great place to kill seven enemies with a single mine is in the deserter montuyoc province main mission there are seven enemies standing close together at the first objective of this mission mark them with the drone to see where they are throw a diversion lure to get them closer together the lure only attracts enemies within a certain radius make sure you throw it far enough so enemies near the water can hear it the enemies will come to investigate and stand around the lure throw 12 flashbangs to blind them run in and quickly place the mine then detonate the mine to kill all of them and get the a better mousetrap trophy compared to other explosives the mine has a rather small explosion radius if you still have trouble buy the explosion radius epic skill from the item skills category you must buy the first upgrade of all item skills to get it this increases the blast radius so you can hit more enemies at once if something goes wrong kill the guy with the yellow quest marker or let him escape to respawn you near the enemy group this same strategy can be used in other places that have seven or more enemies just throw lures until they are all close together stun them with flashbangs place a mine near them and detonate it easy blackout boomer trophy a good place to do this is at the f o b armadillo enemy base in the itacua province where the game begins this is an unidad controlled military base in the east with a power generator first buy the c4 skill from the pause menu once you have it enter the base and throw c4 at the generator blow it up to get the blackout boomer trophy the generator also respawns every time you fast travel thus it is not a problem if you previously destroyed it just fast travel there again for it to respawn easy cluster bomber trophy buy the c4 skill under the item skills category it is also helpful to have the diversion lure skill because it makes it easier to lure enemies together a great place to kill seven enemies with a single c4 blast is in the deserter montuyoc province main mission there are seven enemies standing close together at the first objective of this mission mark them with the drone to see where they are one of them is walking around and the others are standing still throw the c4 when they are all close together then hold l1 to detonate it it has a large blast radius and should kill them all to make this a little easier throw a diversion lure first the enemies will investigate it and get close together if you still have trouble buy the explosion radius epic skill from the item skills category you must buy the first upgrade of all item skills to get it this increases the blast radius so you can hit more enemies at once if something goes wrong kill the guy with the yellow quest marker or let him escape to respawn you near the enemy group this same strategy can be used in other places that have seven or more enemies just throw lures until they are all close together throw the c4 near them and detonate it easy death from above trophy buy the explosion drone skill which is unlocked at level 15 equip the explosive drone in the loadout click on the drone icon to choose between explosive emp etc fly the drone near an enemy and press r3 to kill the enemy with the drone and get the death from above trophy easy long shot trophy use a sniper rifle to do this one can be found in the itacua province where the game begins in the weapon case by the itacua echo rally point which is in the north of the province any other sniper rifle also works slightly north of itacua echo is an enemy checkpoint marked as checkpoint on map there are a bunch of guard towers with snipers inside walk along the road or hill to get 400 meters away from them then kill an enemy using the sniper rifle to see the distance use the binoculars and press square to place a distance marker on the enemy aim a little bit high to account for bullet drop later in the game you will find better scopes and stronger sniper rifles that make doing this slightly easier easy pull trophy first get the mortar rebel skill from the rebellion rising quest which is an unmissable unlock in one of the first few main quests in the itacua province starting province then go to one of the rebel side quests where you must steal a helicopter there are plenty of them throughout the game two of them are in the itacua region they appear while investigating intel alert the lieutenant near the helicopter shoot near him and he will enter the helicopter and try to fly away immediately when he enters the helicopter request a mortar strike from the rebels in the command wheel hold r1 and use the left analogstick to select it you must be aiming at the helicopter when requesting the mortar strike if timed correctly it will shoot the helicopter out of the air and you will get the pull trophy if you fail let the enemies kill you or quit out to main menu and try again easy with a pistol trophy you will often run into snipers throughout the game they are hiding in guard towers when marking them with the binoculars or drone they have a different icon orange crosshairs than normal enemies press triangle 2 to equip the pistol then kill a sniper with it to get the with a pistol trophy you can run straight to a sniper and kill him it does not matter if you are detected or not
