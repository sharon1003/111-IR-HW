niacin more than antiaging written by jeri rossfont size print email i am not a chemist by trade but rather a curious explorer of human biology and more specifically cellular metabolism i am fascinated with how our biology so magically works and i find the discovery process endlessly entertaining it doesn’t surprise me that my second career is taking me towards cosmetic product formulations and that science is driving my abilities to create advanced corrective products that impact cellular health and antiaging while researching active ingredients to address inflammation i stumbled on a patent abstract written by an 82yearold man about a form of niacin that when applied topically acts as a vasodilator to increase circulation his research studies also focused on how topical niacin acts as a carrier for improved penetration of vitamins and other micronutrients these days we are seeing more and more cosmeceutical skin care and body care products with various forms of niacin in their formulations according to dermatologist zoe draelos m d “therapeutic effects of niacinamide will continue to rise” from my research and from having formulated an effective cellulite product using niacin i better understand why this vital nutrient is gaining attention in the skin care industry so what is so ‘hot’ about niacin and what is it anyway let’s take a look at the role that niacin plays in human cellular biology and the active properties that it contributes in skin care treatment formulations what is niacin vitamin b3 niacin is one of eight watersoluble b vitamins niacin plays an important role in ridding the body of toxic and harmful chemicals it also helps the body make various sex and stress related hormones in the adrenal glands niacin is effective in improving circulation and reducing cholesterol levels in the blood much research is underway to substantiate the healing properties of niacin for high cholesterol atherosclerosis diabetes osteoarthritis cataracts and burns it is also being researched for use in skin care products as an antiaging agent for treatment of acne and possibly for prevention of skin cancer to understand why niacin is an emerging therapeutic ingredient it is important to review how this potent active vitamin behaves interactively with cells and skin structures how aging affects the skin as people age progressive changes in the skin occur during the normal aging process both the epidermis and dermis become thinner with a loss of cell numbers and connective tissue this cellular deterioration of skin structures leads to facial wrinkles and is a cofactor in causing cellulite also exposure to ultraviolet sun radiation is a major source of skin oxidative stress that leads to loss of skin cells age spots actinic keratosis and skin cancer the question is how can niacin address these concerns how can niacin help repair and maintenance of healthy skin is dependent upon supplies of many essential nutrients to cellular components as well as the efficient removal of waste products such as carbon dioxide and other metabolic end products an optimal supply of oxygen is required in order to support these natural metabolic cellular functions this is where niacin comes in it is desirable to formulate skin and body care products that work in tandem with cellular biology to improve and prevent skin conditions like aging niacin increases capillary dilation which in turn increases blood flow or what is known as vasodilation our bodies are composed of over 70 trillion cells that rely on fully functioning capillaries for survival including skin cells skin care treatment formulations that contain topical niacin derivatives enhance oxygenation of the dermis due to increased circulation resulting in what i call ‘happy cells’ medical and aesthetic practitioners are already realizing some benefits from using niacin in the treatment of skin conditions dr draelos a pioneer in the field of niacin application explains “niacin is thought to modulate skin leptin levels and alter cellular communication we believe niacinamide a derivative of niacin acts as a topical antiinflammatory to speed cell turnover” dermatologist leslie baumann m d speaking at the american academy of dermatology’s annual 2003 meeting stated “new studies have shown that niacin is beneficial to the skin specifically for problems involving pigmentation and dry skin this could become another promising treatment for aging skin which often becomes dry and flaky as we get older” niacinamide as well has shown to be an effective skinlightening agent and due to its antiinflammatory properties it is being tested as a possible treatment for acne and rosacea niacin and cellulite it should be noted here that in facial products it is preferable to gain the healing properties of niacin without that signature ‘niacin flush’ when taken orally niacin typically causes a systemic rosy to red flush heats up the body and may also promote sweating around the head and neck areas niacinamide is engineered to prevent the niacin flush however it still retains the therapeutic properties of the vitamin for body treatment products a localized flush is desirable indicating an immediate increase in circulation for addressing the treatment of cellulite increased circulation promotes healthy cellular metabolism and aids in reducing inflammation caused by engorged fat cells clients tolerate it well as long as they know to expect the red appearance as being the desired activity versus an allergic reaction i have termed the experience a ‘flushrush’ due to the instant physical stimulation and energy burst you feel from increased circulation and thermal body heat it produces in the treated areas the flush lasts for approximately 20 to 30 minutes the future of niacin in conclusion more research is needed to better understand all of the physiological benefits of niacin for corrective skin and body conditions the future promise of this amazing vitamin is already upon us vitamin b3 is considered by most to be the major b vitamin required for a healthy existence what better than to utilize a nutrient that our bodies already recognize as cellfriendly for topical therapeutic product formulations so next time you see an antiaging skin care moisturizer or cellulite product with niacin give it a try as we know the truth resides in the results i don’t think you’ll be disappointed references brown bg zhao xq chalt a et al simvastatin and niacin antioxidant vitamins or the combination for the

not only as part of the elite group of super fruits the all mighty pomegranate english word comes from the latin words for apple pomum apple and granatus seeded has been dated as far back as 1000 bc and was introduced to north america by spanish settlers in 1769 this red beauty represents global symbolism and history ranging from righteousness prosperity and fertility with over 760 varieties of pomegranate it is one of the oldest known medicines to man ancient greek healers would use pomegranate juice to manage health problems similar to arthritis circulation problems digestive disorders and infections and to add to the wonders of the pomegranate the fruit was also involved in ancient beauty concoctions today with our growing beauty culture and desire to turn back the clock we find ourselves revisiting what our ancient friends already knew with the help of modern science and research pomegranates are packed with phytonutrients vitamin b and an abundance of vitamin c they contain red arils tiny edible seeds that are loaded with juice and provide valuable fiber they are delicious and fantastic to eat  though i would not recommend eating the white membrane that surrounds the arils as it is quite bitter and the consensus is that it is not recommended and for those of us that count calories a 12 cup of raw pomegranate has 80 calories and 0 grams of fat according to the american association for cancer research aacr pomegranate fruit extract contains several polyphenols and anthocyanidins pigment that gives certain fruits their dark red colors its antioxidant activity is higher than that of red wine and green tea and research suggests that pomegranate extract may have significant clinical benefits in decreasing risk for skin cancer by taking pomegranate extract capsules one could reduce or reverse the signs of aging by promoting cell turnover and creating new healthy skin but that is not all evidence shows that including it in your skin care regime can provide wonderful results too rich in ellagic acid to manage free radicals pomegranate oil contains punicic acid an omega 5 conjugated fatty acid effective in aiding cell regeneration and

health and wellness with all your super fruit powerpomegranate almond oil and honey mask½ pomegranate 2 tsp almond oil ½ tbsp organic honey warm up the honey until it becomes liquid not too hot by putting it in a small glass or metal bowl which is immersed in hot water peel the pomegranate half cut the fruit in pieces and put these in a bowl or food processor add the honey and almond oil blend it all into a smooth and uniform paste spread this gently and equally with your fingertips on your clean face and neck keep the eye area clear now lie down relax and leave the mask on for 20 minutes then wash it off with lukewarm water and end with a splash of cold water pat your skin dry with a clean towel finally apply a moisturizer this way you seal your skin to keep the water inside for all skin types this fruit mask recipe peels your skin and we do not recommend using it on acne skin copyright ® 20092010 natural – homeremediesforlife pomegranate oat bran scrub2 ounces pomegranate juice 2 ounces orange juice 2 tbsp honey 2 tbsp sea salt 3 to 4 ounces oat bran1 in a container large enough to hold two cups combine pomegranate and orange juices to this add the honey and mix together well 2 now add sea salt and oat bran mix together and allow the oat bran to soak up the liquids about 10 to 20 minutes 3 make sure to apply to a clean face probably the easiest way is to apply in the shower after you clean your face and allow it to set while you do other things the steam from the shower helps allow the ingredients to penetrate your skin then gently scrub off as you shower
