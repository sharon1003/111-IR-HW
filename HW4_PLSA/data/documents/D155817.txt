seller to give you a copy of theirs even if he does ask you would still want a current survey of the property done for your own protection either way your lawyer should be ordering the title search and survey the surveyor will draw a map that shows the property limits as well as where the house garage and other features like boundary fences or walls driveways and sheds are located it also reveals easements such as power poles drainage ditches sewer manholes etc this information is especially important if you or a neighboring property owner decides to put an addition on the house put in a pool etc it can cost a lot more money in the longrun should you add an improvement and then realize you are over the property line i know some buyers request that the property survey stakes be left in and that will cost you more money per stake i dont know if that stakes left are really that necessary unless you actually need to see where the property lines end good luck gina chirico sales

2008survey is a proof that there is such property and how big what have in the property and as you know it could change eg without a survey a legal paper in which a seller may sell you something does not exist this often happen in remote purchasing for example many years ago my fathers friend in taiwan bought a land in fl that he never visit and only see the nice picture with disney world nearby as claimed etc and that legal paper sold him something does not exist lawyer is professional just like doctor they perform 100 fact so a current survey by licensed surveyer is all the will believe the seller may forget something change after they bought the property eg my friend bought a house and later remove the swimming pool and the buyers banker in the office never visit the property how do they know if there is still a swimming pool or not so in general when you involved multiple parties paper works is very important house is not like a car that it is much easier to sell something either not exist or much lesser value than described even car is possible like after sign the title some bad sellers often mechenics would replace cheap tire with the luxury or stereo system with cheaper ones etc this is also possible with buying a house i know many cases that before closing the seller removes many fixtures often builder professionals or construction contrators and that often happen in for sale by owner case where there is no third party such as realtor to prove so last minute walk thru before closing is very important the title search is a more logical than physical check eg one seller could have sold the same house to multiple buyers how do you know it happens a lot in pa where legal checking is not very tight2 votes • flag • link jeremy s hi…   cherry hill njmon jun

a licensed surveyor the survey will show you the property boundaries structures any easements set backs and potential encroachments if you are getting a mortgage a lender will more than likely require you to get a survey they want to know exactly what they are lending on it is true some lenders will allow you to ask a seller for a copy of their survey must be one with a raised seal no older then 10 years and for the seller to sign an affidavit of no change stating that their has been no change on the property this action shifts a liability to the seller and can put them at risk and you are then relying on the accuracy and honesty of the seller also title insurance may only cover older surveys as of the date of the survey anything that happened after that date may be not be covered as it is deemed an exception that the buyer accepted surveyors also prepare a new written “meets and bounds” description of the location of the property this description attaches to the deed the deed is the key document that transfers title from the seller to the buyer dont you want to know what you are buying one last thing if you intend to make improvements to the home fence pool additions etc nj towns will most likely require you to have a survey this is just informational and in no way considered legal advice you should always seek legal advice from an attorney kristina lowe realtor  howell nj

williamstown njtue jun 17 2008hi jane check with your mortgage company and title company first to see if they need a new survey they may not require one or may accept an older one with an affidavit of no change  sellers stating no changes have been made since the survey was done i am not sure why your lawyer has no intention of asking for one that is not a good thing you can always ask your realtor to ask the other agent to get a copy from the sellers i do recommend that you have one and if you can get a new one done so that you know for sure where your property lines are and if there are any encroachments or other things you may need to know about take care angela angie allchin century 21 rauh  johns 8565820366 x 1720 votes • flag • link corey grushin  agent east brunswick njtue jun 17 2008jane most times a survey is just a copy of one done a while back but the surveyor does come out to make sure no changes have occurred to the property home and additional structures the survey is for your own protection and it is usually required by the lender you can ask the seller for a copy of their survey to use with your purchase as long as no changes have been made to the property home and other structures the survey has to have been done in the last 10 years and the sellers will have to sign a survey affidavit saying no changes have been made to the property since the survey was done if your attorney refuses to ask the other side for a copy you can ask your realtor to ask the sellers for a copy0 votes • flag • link search adviceeg  foreclosure   short sale   mortgage  eg  san
