answer by ali ladak confidence votes 18the spontaneity of a redox reaction is a function of the reduction potentials of the two species involved in the reaction the reducing agent and the oxidizing agent to determine if a reaction is spontaneous or not you must first isolate the two halfreactions to do this see the related questions link to the left how do you balance a redox reaction once you have the two halfreactions you must look at a table of standard potentials to find the values for the halfreactions occurring in the overall reaction in question for a table of standard reduction potentials see the web links to the left of this answer standard potentials are almost always listed as reductions  in other words the energy either require or released when an element gains an electron however a redox reaction always involves one species an atom or molecule gaining one or more electrons and another species losing one or more electrons to convert a reduction potential into the opposite reaction an oxidation reaction just flip the direction of the arrow in the reaction and reverse the sign of the potential now that you have the standard potentials of the two two halfreactions correctly written as one reduction and one oxidation with the correct signs then you have to simply add up the two halfcell potentials if the sum of the potentials is positive then the reaction is spontaneous if the sum is negative than the reverse reaction is spontaneous the larger the magnitude of the sum the more the reaction is spontaneous or that the reverse reaction is spontaneous is negative if you cant remember whether positive is spontaneous or not look at the table of potentials  remember that elements like potassium are very easily oxidized strong reducing agent and react violently to give up an electron whereas an element like fluorine is a very strong oxidizing agent and is easily reduced this calculation however only applies to standard conditions pure substances and 1 m solutions and when away from these conditions a more dilute solution for instance then the nernst equation must be used to correct for this difference the nernst equation is e  e0  rtn f ln q where e0 is the standard potential of the reaction r is the universal gas constant 8314510 j k1 mol1 t is the temperature n is the number of electrons being transferred in the reaction and f is faradays constant 9648456 cmole and q is the reaction quotient concentration of products over reactants raised to the power of their respective coefficients in the balanced reaction for more about how to use the nernst equation see the other links under the web links to the left of this answer40 people found this useful was this answer useful yes somewhat no
