answer by rudolph hyde confidence votes 178ki am a veteran and retired federal agent i am a cinephile and strongly interested in wwii esp the european campaign there really was a roman emperor named marcus aurelius and he had a son named commodus who succeeded him in contrast to the movie marcus named commodus his successor rather than maximus however some historians suspect commodus did have a hand in his fathers death commodus did not die in the arena he was killed by a wrestler after commodus death rome did not return to a republic as suggested in the movie general maximus decimus meridius is a fictitious character there was a general named avidius cassius who fought in the campaign depicted in the film and upon hearing of marcus death declared himself emperor of rome however his own soldiers assassinated him later in roman history there was a general named maximus who appears to have had revolutionary ideas commodus really did have a sister named lucilla and as depicted in the movie she hated him lucilla was married to the coemperor lucius verus lucilla plotted to have commodus assassinated but commodus had her exiled for the plot and later executed so unlike what happened in the movie commodus outlived his sister it was another sister not lucilla that commodus was rumored to have had sexual relations the tattoo on maximus arm reads spqr the letters relate to an oftenused latin phrase senatus populusque romanus which means the senate and people of rome however it is highly unlikely a roman general would have such a tattoo as tattoos were worn by foreigners and lowerclass citizens no it is not maximus wasnt a real general at the time and marcus didnt think of commodus as being unfit to rule he was actually made successor at the age of 17 there really was
