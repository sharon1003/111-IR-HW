anybody can answer the best answers are voted up and rise to the top why do pitchers sometimes pitch “out of the stretch”up vote8down votefavorite my understanding is that this is done in critical situations as when there are opposing men on base usually more than one is this true and if so why is that is it to increase the chances of striking out the next batter or otherwise decrease that chances of the batter making contact with the ball that may even get him out but advance the runnersbaseball pitchingshare improve this questionedited dec 30 14 at 125user527asked oct 4 14 at 030tom

windup when there are no runners on base it usually helps with the pitchers rhythm they are able to use a high leg kick and deliver a pitch some relievers will pitch out of the stretch whether or not there is a runner on base this is because they often come in with runners on base and their rhythm is to pitch out of the stretch as for the stretch it is used to deter the other teams runners from stealing a base if the pitcher was in the windup as soon as he started his windup the runners can steal if the pitchers stops his windup that would be a balk with runners on base he can still pick from the windup by stepping off with his foot that is on the rubber rhp would step off with his right foot and vice versa for a lhp in the stretch pitchers will slide step to deliver the ball quickly to home this is when they step to home without bringing their lead leg up very far from the ground many pitchers can be around 12 seconds to home plate with the slide step giving the catcher a good chance to throw a stealing runner out basically the difference is in the time to the plate which is why all pitchers pitch out of the stretch with runners on 1st and or 2nd one side note is that with a runner on third some pitchers may choose to pitch out of the windup because in order to get the runner out stealing home they simply have to get the ball to the catcher this is a per pitcher and situation type of thing and while not common it is certainly not rare usually there is a slight to mild drop off in the effectiveness of pitchers pitches when they are in the stretch especially using a slide step here is a brief wiki article that may help understandingshare improve this answeredited oct 13 14 at 2204answered oct 4 14 at 104diggers32601 14 34also worth noting that if a pitcher is pitching out of the windup runners may leave the instant he begins moving his left foot for a righthanded pitcher if the pitcher stops the pitching movement during the windup its a balk thats also why if a pitcher is in the windup and they want to step off the rubber they must do it with their right foot – the general oct 6 14 at 2223another interesting note is that starting pitcher david price always pitches out of the stretch which is unusual for a starting pitcher – the general oct 6 14 at 2224the general david price does pitch from the windup it is a very simplified windup that is close to pitching from the stretch – diggers3 oct 7 14 at 159add a commentup vote1down vote when pitching out of the stretch you have two main advantages when you are in your set position you can still attempt a pickoff so after you have brought your hands together and foot back you can still attempt to throw to any base this is the biggest reason you dont lose time stepping backwards in the windup you are required to step behind the mound with your nonmound foot before delivering the ball home no matter how fast you are at doing this it has to take at least 5 second and more than enough time to give even the slowest runners an extra 10 feet can you pick a guy off out of the full windup yes just step behind the mound with your mound pivot foot and throw to any base when do guys go to the stretch when there is any runner on base even with a man on third almost all pitchers would be in the stretch pitchers dont practice stepping back fast so their backwards step to forward motion could take longer than a second which would allow average runners to take home why do some guys always throw from the stretch the windup has the advantage of giving you more momentum but some guys give that away for familiarity you cant be in the windup all the time but you can be in the stretch all the time so by only practicing pitching from the stretch you get extra practice with arm angles and release pointsshare improve this answeranswered oct 11 14 at 651coachd3906 5 24one note is that you do not have to step behind the rubber in the wind up you just have to begin the windup with your non rubber foot left foot for rhp and right foot for lhp – diggers3 oct 13 14 at 2200add a commentup vote3down vote the stertch a small part of the set pitching position the set for right handed pitcher stand in front of rubber with toes pointing towards thirdarms apart on the sides this position is called the stretch part of the pitch because the pitcher usually stretches to look toward home plate to take the sign from the catcher delivery begins when he puts his arms together in front of him  a movement noticed by a pausethis is calledcoming setafter coming set a step is taken toward home and the pitch is delivered sometimes using a high kicksometimes a leg slide the wind up on top or in front of rubber with feet pointed toward home plate prir to throwing the pitch he may take a step back toward second or to either side during the delivery he must take a step forward toward home plate there is a lot more to it than this hpe this helpsshare improve this answeranswered oct 28 15 at
