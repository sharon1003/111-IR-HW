peak in july 1999in 1893 at the age of 33 bates an english professor at wellesley college had taken a train trip to colorado springs colorado to teach a short summer school session at colorado college 5 several of the sights on her trip inspired her and they found their way into her poem including the worlds columbian exposition in chicago the white city with its promise of the future contained within its gleaming white buildings 6 the wheat fields of americas heartland kansas through which her train was riding on july 16 and the majestic view of the great plains from high atop pikes peak 7on the pinnacle of that mountain the words of the poem started to come to her and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original antlers hotel the poem was initially published two years later in the congregationalist to commemorate the fourth of july it quickly caught the publics fancy amended versions were published in 1904 and 1911 the first known melody written for the song was sent in by silas pratt when the poem was published in the congregationalist by 1900 at least 75 different melodies had been written 8 a hymn tune composed by samuel a ward was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today just as bates had been inspired to write her poem ward too was inspired to compose his tune the tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from coney island back to his home in new york city after a leisurely summer day in 1882 and he immediately wrote it down supposedly he was so anxious to capture the tune in his head he asked fellow passenger friend harry martin for his shirt cuff to write the tune on he composed the tune for the old hymn o mother dear jerusalem retitling the work materna wards music combined with batess poem were first published together in 1910 and titled america the beautiful 9ward died in 1903 not knowing the national stature his music would attain since the music was only first applied to the song in 1904 bates was more fortunate since the songs popularity was well established by the time of her death in 1929 8at various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song was written particularly during the john f kennedy administration there have been efforts to give america the beautiful legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to or in place of  the starspangled banner  but so far this has not succeeded proponents prefer america the beautiful for various reasons saying it is easier to sing more melodic and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as  the starspangled banner  some prefer america the beautiful over the starspangled banner due to the latters waroriented imagery others prefer the starspangled banner for the same reason while that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem america the beautiful continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of americans  citation neededthis song was used as the background music of the television broadcast of the tiangong1 launch 10the song is often included in
