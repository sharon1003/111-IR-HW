dolphins implementation the game cube controller is autoconfigured and calibrated with full rumble support wireless controllers and bongos are supported this guide is primarily for the official adapter but thirdparty adapters that are compatible with super smash bros for wii u generally also work if your adapter has a switch for choosing between pc mode and wii u mode set it to wii u mode

installation linux linux support does not require any special drivers as long as dolphin was built with libusb support however a udev rule must be created to allow access to the device paste the

rules with sudo udevadm control reloadrules then reinsert the adapter dolphin should now detect it in the controller settings refer to dolphin setup below if you want to change the rule links for instructions are available on the libusb faq mac osdue to the nature of apples hid implementation all hid devices including nonstandard ones are intercepted by iokits hid driver since the adapter does not supply a valid report descriptor this makes the iokit driver useless for direct communication instead iokits behavior may be manipulated via a codeless kext to simply ignore the adapter and permit a lowerlevel connection like the one dolphin makes easy install installer package for mac os el capitan 1011 and later installer package for older versions of mac osterminal install standalone kext

controller adapter will need a certain driver to let dolphin detect it and use it avoid v joy the software that utilizes v joy drivers such as game cube usb adapter driver can treat the game cube controllers as generic gamepads for windows they can be configured in dolphin like any other controller unlike v joy dolphins native support will offer more straightforward and added missing supports from v joy ie force feedback and offer better latency v joy and dolphins native support conflict with one another so to use the native support in dolphin driver services must be stopped through game cube usb adapter driver s window you probably already have ran zadig setup if the game cube usb adapter driver version is v30 or later skip to dolphin setup below if you havent encountered any problems with it windows if you are using 502472 or newer you need to either install a filter driver using zadig or install usb dk doing both is unnecessary but doesnt lead to any problems if you arent sure which one to pick use zadig and follow the instructions below if you are using 502341 or older using zadig is required using zadig plug in the game cube controller adapter if it hasnt been already download and launch zadig if youre using the mayflash adapter make sure you switch it to wii u or zadig wont pick it up properly1 from the options menu in zadig select list all devices2 in the pulldown menu select wup028 ensure that its usb id is 057e 0337 if it does not appear in the list then try inserting the adapter specifically its black usb cord into another usb port3 on the right column select win usb then click replace driver select yes to modify the system driver when it said the driver is installed successfully then you can close the zadig setup and continue to dolphin setup below problem with zadig if there is a problem in the installation process you can completely restart zadig by following these instructions reverting the adapters driver back to vanilla state open device manager or simply run devmgmtmsc look for the wup028 device which is usually under the universal serial bus devices open its context menu rightclick and select properties click uninstall under the driver tab check box delete the driver software for this device then proceed then reinsert the adapter the steps for driver installation can now be followed delete temporary setup files fixes driver installation failedkill installerx64exe or installerx86exe from the task manager then delete userprofileusbdriver and run zadig again android android doesnt require anything special to make the adapter work under the gamepad controller settings for each controller that you want to use the adapter with change the selection from emulated to gamecube adapter after that point make sure to start the game with the adapter plugged in and android will ask if you want dolphin to have permission to use the device input doesnt work there is a bug in androids usbmanager framework that sometimes causes dolphin to be incapable of reading the adapter in these instances a toast window will pop up asking you to unplug and replugin the adapter do so and dolphin will be able to read the adapter after that dolphin setup the left slot on the adapter while engraved wii u facing up is the first port and so on so dont mistake it for being the other way aroundbefore dolphin 404599the game cube controller adapter is not supported in versions older than 404599 updating to a newer version is necessary dolphin 404599 to dolphin 408593with any necessary installation complete run dolphin and check direct connect under game cube adapter in the controller settings then restart dolphin set game cube ports to standard controller corresponding to each port on the adapter that is plugged in with the actual game cube controller the setup for the adapter is now completed to test simply start a game that uses game cube controllers dk bongo controllers are supported with dk bongo controllers plugged in select taru konga bongos in the controller settings dolphin supports hotplug so the pads can be unplugged and plugged into other ports if a pad is unplugged from the adapter dolphin will use what is configured pc keyboardmouse pc gamepad etc dolphin 408601 and newer with any necessary installation complete run dolphin and click the game cube controller dropdown select game cube adapter for wii u on any slot that you wish to use the adapter for hitting configure when this is selected allows you to turn rumble offon per controller as well as a toggle for using the dk bongos unlike 408593 and before you will have to choose between game cube adapter for wii u or standard controller for a real game cube controller or the device emulating a game cube controller the hotplug properties are also removed adapter not detected its worth noting that only the first instance of dolphin emulator will detect the adapter another instance will detect the second one if inserted and so on if the dolphin emulator couldnt detect the adapter its possible that you already have another one running dolphin might not show the correct status of the adapter if direct connect is unchecked check that then restart dolphin if the adapter is not detected at all then it may only be a matter of changing usb ports and restarting dolphin or its driversetup might have recently been changedoverridden you should follow the instruction again from one of the sections for your system
