the term “ecofriendly” is used to describe activities which are good for the environment it is a shortening of “ecologically friendly” and you may also hear terms like “environmentally friendly” or “green” used to describe similar activities there are a range of ways in which activities can be eco or environmentally friendly ranging from products which are constructed in an environmentally friendly way to making lifestyle changes which are designed to benefit the environment people engage in ecofriendly activities because they are concerned about the health of the environment environmental issues were first pushed to the forefront of the collective consciousness in the late 1900s when people realized that their activities were having a negative impact on the environment pollution rampant use of natural resources and other activities were questioned in light of information about how these activities hurt the environment and people began to look into more environmentally friendly ways of living and doing business many savvy companies realized that investing in green product development would pay off and lines of ecofriendly products can be found in many regions of the world today as a result these products are usually made in factories which are environmentally friendly such as facilities built from recycled materials which use solar panels for power and they are made from components which are also good for the environment like plantsourced ingredients for soaps or recycled metal for electronics product packaging advertisements and other materials may also be environmentally friendly strictly speaking ecofriendly products still have an impact on the environment but the impact is greatly reduced when compared to conventionally produced products in some cases environmentally friendly products may even have a positive benefit depending on how the company does business many such products are also aimed at lifestyle changes which benefit the environment so even if the product itself is not totally neutral the actions undertaken by the consumer after buying the product are beneficial for example ecofriendly light bulbs require energy and resources to make but they save energy once they are installed in a home products are not the only thing which can be environmentally friendly activities can also be friendly to the environment as in the case of things like carpooling gardening composting and recycling some people think that ecofriendly products are only the first step and that people who are really committed to

sustainability of business and some companies are becoming more concerned with this in some cases becoming more ecologically sensitive helps the bottom line resources are becoming scarcer so techniques and processes that conserve resources and promote efficiency are going to be more cost effective as you said most companies will use their move to more sustainable practices as a marketing opportunity but i do not believe that all companies use ecofriendly operations strictly as a marketing tool however like you i would like to see a move to more regulation in the marketing of ecofriendly products alchemy post 1ecofriendly products are not always as good for the environment as they claim the government has not established standards or laws that clearly define what constitutes an ecofriendly product or process the term ecofriendly is often nothing more than a marketing ploy for example a product that contains 50 recycled paper in the packaging could be considered ecofriendly even though they were manufactured in dirty factories in china in fact most products labeled ecofriendly are manufactured or sourced overseas almost all of these overseas factories would fail to meet even our nation’s most lax pollution clean water and environmental safety regulations a consumer should evaluate the total ecological impact of a product to decide whether it is ecofriendly post your comments post anonymously loginusernamepasswordforgot password registerusernamepasswordconfirmemail
