modern philosophy is disputed the early renaissance is often considered less modern and more medieval compared to the later high renaissance by the 17th and 18th centuries the major figures in philosophy of mind epistemology and metaphysics were roughly divided into two main groups the  rationalists  mostly in france and germany argued all knowledge must begin from certain  innate ideas  in the mind major rationalists were descartes baruch spinoza gottfried leibniz and nicolas malebranche the  empiricists  by contrast held that knowledge must begin with sensory experience major figures in this line of thought are john locke george berkeley and david hume these are retrospective categories for which kant is largely responsible ethics and political philosophy are usually not subsumed under these categories though all these philosophers worked in ethics in their own distinctive styles other important figures in political philosophy include thomas hobbes and jeanjacques rousseau in the late eighteenth century immanuel kant set forth a groundbreaking philosophical system which claimed to bring unity to rationalism and empiricism whether or not he was right he did not entirely succeed in ending philosophical dispute kant sparked a storm of philosophical work in germany in the early nineteenth century beginning with german idealism the characteristic theme of idealism was that the world and the mind equally must be understood according to the same categories it culminated in the work of georg wilhelm friedrich hegel who among many other things said that the real is rational the rational is real hegels work was carried in many directions by his followers and critics karl marx appropriated both hegels philosophy of history and the empirical ethics dominant in britain transforming hegels ideas into a strictly materialist form setting the grounds for the development of a science of society søren kierkegaard in contrast dismissed all systematic philosophy as an inadequate guide to life and meaning for kierkegaard life is meant to be lived not a mystery to be solved arthur schopenhauer took idealism to the conclusion that the world was nothing but the futile endless interplay of images and desires and advocated atheism and pessimism schopenhauers ideas were taken up and transformed by nietzsche who seized upon their various dismissals of the world to proclaim  god is dead  and to reject all systematic philosophy and all striving for a fixed truth transcending the individual nietzsche found in this not grounds for pessimism but the possibility of a new kind of freedom19thcentury british philosophy came increasingly to be dominated by strands of neohegelian thought and as a reaction against this figures such as bertrand russell and george edward moore began moving in the direction of analytic philosophy which was essentially an updating of traditional empiricism to accommodate the new developments in logic of the german mathematician gottlob frege renaissance philosophy  editrenaissance humanism emphasized the value of human beings see oration on the dignity of man and opposed dogma and scholasticism this new interest in human activities led to the development of political science with the prince of niccolò macchiavelli humanists differed from medieval scholars also because they saw the natural world as mathematically ordered and pluralistic instead of thinking of it in terms of purposes and goals renaissance philosophy is perhaps best explained by two propositions made by leonardo da vinci in his notebooks all of our knowledge has its origins in our perceptions there is no certainty where one can neither apply any of the mathematical sciences nor any of those which are based upon the mathematical sciences in a similar way galieo based his scientific method on experiments but also developed mathematical methods for application to problems in physics these two ways to conceive human knowledge formed the background for the principle of empiricism and rationalism respectively 2renaissance philosophers  editpico della mirandola nicolas of cusa giordano bruno galileo galilei niccolò macchiavelli rationalism  editmain article rationalism modern philosophy traditionally begins with rené descartes and his dictum  i think therefore i am  in the early seventeenth century the bulk of philosophy was dominated by scholasticism written by theologians and drawing upon plato aristotle and early church writings descartes argued that many predominant scholastic metaphysical doctrines were meaningless or false in short he proposed to begin philosophy from scratch in his most important work meditations on first philosophy he attempts just this over six brief essays he tries to set aside as much as he possibly can of all his beliefs to determine what if anything he knows for certain he finds that he can doubt nearly everything the reality of physical objects god his memories history science even mathematics but he cannot doubt that he is in fact doubting he knows what he is thinking about even if it is not true and he knows that he is there thinking about it from this basis he builds his knowledge back up again he finds that some of the ideas he has could not have originated from him alone but only from god he proves that god exists he then demonstrates that god would not allow him to be systematically deceived about everything in essence he vindicates ordinary methods of science and reasoning as fallible but not false rationalists  editrené descartes baruch spinoza gottfried leibniz empiricism  editmain article empiricism empiricism is a theory of knowledge which opposes other theories of knowledge such as rationalism idealism and historicism empiricism asserts that knowledge comes only or primarily via sensory experience as opposed to rationalism which asserts that knowledge comes also from pure thinking both empiricism and rationalism are individualist theories of knowledge whereas historicism is a social epistemology while historicism also acknowledges the role of experience it differs from empiricism by assuming that sensory data cannot be understood without considering the historical and cultural circumstances in which observations are made empiricism should not be mixed up with empirical research because different epistemologies should be considered competing views on how best to do studies and there is near consensus among researchers that studies should be empirical today empiricism should therefore be understood as one among competing ideals of getting knowledge or how to do studies as such empiricism is first and foremost characterized by the ideal to let observational data speak for themselves while the competing views are opposed to this ideal the term empiricism should thus not just be understood in relation to how this term has been used in the history of philosophy it should also be constructed in a way which makes it possible to distinguish empiricism among other epistemological positions in contemporary science and scholarship in other words empiricism as a concept has to be constructed along with other concepts which together make it possible to make important discriminations between different ideals underlying contemporary science empiricism is one of several competing views that predominate in the study of human knowledge known as epistemology empiricism emphasizes the role of experience and evidence especially sensory perception in the formation of ideas over the notion of innate ideas or tradition 3 in contrast to for example rationalism which relies upon reason and can incorporate innate knowledge empiricists  editjohn locke george berkeley david hume francis bacon political philosophy  editmain article political philosophy political philosophy is the study of such topics as politics liberty justice property rights law and the enforcement of a legal code by authority what

duties citizens owe to a legitimate government if any and when it may be legitimately overthrown—if ever in a vernacular sense the term political philosophy often refers to a general view or specific

idealism idealism refers to the group of philosophies which assert that reality or reality as we can know it is fundamentally a construct of the mind or otherwise immaterial epistemologically idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mindindependent thing in a sociological sense idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society 5 as an ontological doctrine idealism goes further asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit 6 idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind an extreme version of this idealism can exist in the philosophical notion of solipsism idealist philosophers  editimmanuel kant johann gottlieb fichte friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling georg wilhelm

holds that the starting point of philosophical thinking must be the individual and the experiences of the individual building on that existentialists hold that moral thinking and scientific thinking together do not suffice to understand human existence and therefore a further set of categories governed by the norm of authenticity is necessary to understand human existence 7 8 9existential
