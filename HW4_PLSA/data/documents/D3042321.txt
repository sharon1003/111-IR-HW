science  mathematics astronomy  space does the moon give off any heat follow 16 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer yes it does technically according to thermal radiation theory first link any mass not at absolute zero will eventually radiate energy away from its surface this radiation is a form of heat the others being convection and conduction since the moon is a mass a large one at that and is not at absolute zero temperature it must emit thermal radiation the second link shows a white paper discussing the topic in detail and even given the radiations physical power the exceedingly low energy wavelength of roughly 125cm this is so low in fact that it often times is simply ignored source shttpenwikipediaorgwikithermalradhttpwwwmonsteindeastronomypublicat grimace guy · 1 decade ago5 0 comment askers rating the moon is emitting heat think about it logically it must or else it would melt why the sun is constantly adding a lot of thermal energy to its surface at a rate of about 1500 watts per square meter i found 1500watt space heaters on a quick google search fyi the moon then radiates this back into space via blackbody radiation if it did not then it would be constantly getting hotter and hotter think of how hot the sun makes the sand on the beach here on earth imagine if there were no atmosphere and no ozone layer to filter some of that light before it hit the sand  this is whats happening to the lunar surface all the time and at any point on the moon the day is 708 hours long this is why the apollo missions landed at spots where it was morning on the moon  so that the ground wouldnt be too hot accordingly the moon radiates this heat back out into space rather quickly for the same reason that it gains it so quickly  there is no atmosphere to hold it in as for giving off any heat of its own very little remains from what it had when it formed the moon has a cold dead core which is why it has no magnetic field this is why a permanent lunar base would need strong radiation shielding zero byte · 1 decade ago3 1 comment yes sun addsd energy as shortwave electromagnetic radiation light and the moon gives off at extreme longwave light radiation heat the moon acts like a black body look it upsecondsun · 1 decade ago4 0 comment yes it does but nothing spectacular the core of the moon is solid and it is tectonically active but suns rays hit the moon and are converted to light and heat northstar · 1 decade ago3 0 comment actually yes it does the top 8 miles of the moons crust are surprisingly radioactive when the apollo 15 astronauts used thermal measuring equipment they got unusually high readings which indicated that the heat flow near the apennine mountains was indeed very high in fact one nasa expert confessed when we saw that we said my god this place is about to melt the core must be very hot but that is the puzzle  the moons core is not very hot however the amount of radioactive materials on the surface is not only embarrassingly high but considering the relatively cold interior difficult to account for so where did all this hot radioactive material uranium thorium and potassium actually come from and if it came from the moons interior how did it get onto the surface nightworks · 1 decade ago3 2 comment honey  be a scientist  go out in moonlight and hold you hands towards the moon  how does it feel  wow  you just got an answer not enough to notice then try it with the sun you will soon be into rocket scienceeastanglianuk1951 · 1 decade ago2 2 comment yesthe sun is hitting it which in return is absorbed into the moonrock and dust and gives off a little heat im sure it aint much thocomethunter · 1 decade ago3 0 commentdear its good to look at things as its moon can give us a deep heat in the soulbasel q · 1 decade ago1 2 comment no but the moon reflect heat from the sun source s moonxman · 1 decade ago0 4 comment no the moon is a cold dry orb whose surface is studded with craters and strewn with rocks and dust called regolith the moon has no atmosphere recent lunar missions indicate that there might be some frozen ice at the poles no heat at allfreethinker · 1 decade ago1 5 comment1 2 next perhaps you would like to learn more about one of these want to build your own website earn your mba onlinefind the best luxury cars try online nursing courses
