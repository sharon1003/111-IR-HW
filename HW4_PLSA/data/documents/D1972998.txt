dharaviby katia savchuk  matias echanove often dubbed “asia’s largest slum” dharavi is in fact a heartshaped agglomeration of primarily informal settlements literally located in the heart of mumbai india’s commercial capital once a remote settlement on the outskirts of the city dharavi — due to mumbai’s rapid northward expansion — now finds itself strategically located between the city’s two main suburban railway lines and a stone’s throw away from the bandrakurla complex the new financial and commercial center these geographic advantages and mumbai’s relative shortage of developable land combine to make dharavi a prime piece of real estate potentially worth billions of dollars creating pressure for redevelopment the area spanning an area of about 223 hectares 535 acres dharavi is a transportation hub bordered by the sion mahim and matunga railway stations and two major roads sion and mahim link roads that connect the eastern and western parts of the city dharavi is home to between half a million and one million people no recent and reliable population statistics are available a 1986 survey by the national slum dwellers federation nsdf counted 530225 people 106045 households living in 80518 structures the numbers have surely grown since then as evidenced in the popular aerial images of the slum’s contiguous rooftops dharavi is an extremely dense environment a recent survey by the kamla raheja vidyanidhi institute of architecture krvia established that a central area of dharavi chamra bazaar contained densities of up to 336643 people per square kilometer assuming a population of 700000 the population density in dharavi would be around 314887km² this is 11 times as dense as mumbai as a whole the most densely populated city in the world with 29500 peoplekm² and more than 6 times as dense as daytime manhattan about 50000 peoplekm² history and identity dharavi was originally marshy terrain home to the kolis a traditional fishing community who lived at the edge of mahim creek as the swamps separating the seven islands that formed bombay were filled in migrants from all over india settled in dharavi potters from gujarat tanners from tamil nadu and embroidery workers from uttar pradesh were among those who put down roots in dharavi beginning in the nineteenth century for migrants dharavi offered work and affordable housing for authorities until recently it was a place where illegal settlements could acceptably proliferate away from the central city today dharavi is composed of almost 100 distinct nagars or neighborhoods that form a mosaic of regional linguistic religious caste and class identities its largest communities are tamil and maharashtrian each comprising about a third of the population however virtually all regions of india are represented in dharavi with the newest wave of migrants coming from bihar dharavi is home to hindus muslims christians buddhists and others who — with the notable exception of the 199293 communal riots — have lived side by side largely in peace the majority of dharavi’s residents are dalits former untouchables but members of many other castes and tribes are present as well dharavi is home not only to the urban poor but also to some middleclass professionals unable to find affordable housing elsewhere economy dharavi is not only a residential space but also a major economic hub representing the city’s vast informal sector dharavi’s commercial enterprises include recycling industries leather tanneries heavy metal work woodwork and manufactured goods such as garments shoes luggage jewelry industries generally serve all of mumbai and many products are even distributed in global markets one conservative estimate places the annual value of goods produced in dharavi at usd 500 million “inside the slums” the economist 27105 commercial and manufacturing enterprises provide employment for a large share of dharavi’s population as well as for some living outside dharavi much of dharavi’s productivity is rooted in a decentralized production process relying on a vast network of small homebased production units land and housing the brihanmumbai municipal corporation bmc own most of the land in dharavi with private landholders and the central government controlling the rest an informal real estate market operates in the area with prices varying by location and building quality while some residents live in structures with tin walls and plastic sheeting many have moved up to brick or concrete and have added lofts upper stories and decorative elements some owners lease spaces to tenants having purchased more than one house or moved out of dharavi although a majority of structures constitute “slum housing” dharavi also contains other housing typologies including the former village structures of koliwada planned government chawls and transit accommodations and governmentsponsored highrises those who have never ventured into dharavi may imagine it as a wasteland of tentlike temporary structures an immense junkyard crowded with undernourished people completely disconnected from the rest of the world surviving on charity and pulling the economy backward beneath the sea of corrugated tin roofs the reality could hardly be more different dharavi is a highly developed urban area composed of distinct neighborhoods and bustling with economic activity that is integrated socially economically and culturally at metropolitan regional and global levels developing dharavi past attempts previously ignored by authorities dharavi was officially recognized as a slum in 1976 when state slum policy shifted from demolition to upgradation during the next decade the government took measures against crime and illicit liqueur production and brought in basic amenities such as water taps toilets drains and electricity during a visit to dharavi in 1985 prime minister rajiv gandhi announced a grant of rs 100 crore to bombay a substantial portion of which was allocated to infrastructural and housing projects in dharavi under the prime minister’s grant project pmgp beginning in 1995 the slum rehabilitation scheme srs has provided incentives for developers to construct buildings with free 225 sq ft flats for slum dwellers in exchange for building rights which can be sold on the open market as transfer of development rights tdr most of the highrise buildings that pepper dharavi’s skyline were constructed under this scheme the opportunity of the millennium — but for whom in the context of rising land values the latest plan to redevelop dharavi was elaborated a decade ago by usbased architect and consultant mukesh mehta and approved by the state government of maharashtra in 2004 known as the dharavi redevelopment project drp and overseen by the slum rehabilitation authority sra the plan is painted as a winwin situation in which eligible slum dwellers receive secure housing and amenities while middle classes gain new residential and commercial spaces developers and the government make a profit and an embarrassing blot is removed from the landscape of the aspiring “worldclass city”valued at rs 93 billion around usd 23 billion the plan —which authorities have dubbed “the opportunity of the millennium” — divides dharavi into five sectors to be developed by global firms after a competitive bidding process profits from the sale of highend developments will fund the resettlement of eligible slum dwellers those who can prove their residence prior to january 1 1995 in free 225 sq ft flats in multistory buildings developers are also charged with providing some amenities and infrastructural improvements in january 2008 sra officials announced a shortlist of 19 bidders out of the 26 who had submitted expression of interest documents since tenders were invited in august 2007 the selected companies which include major indian real estate developers and many global firms will submit financial bids within 45 days although many laud the plan’s transcendence of a piecemeal approach the project has been criticized for being prodeveloper instead of proresident for proceeding without transparency towards consent of or consultation with the community and for adopting a tabula rasa approach that ignores the generations of incremental selfdevelopment that have made dharavi the unique and productive place it is today residents have further protested that the plan will deprive many of their livelihoods does not allot enough space in light of current tenement sizes and does not account for dharavi’s sizable population of renters and more recent migrants experts have further warned that the plan promotes insupportable densities does not adequately consider environmental impacts or future growth and does not effectively integrate dharavi with mumbai as a whole some have also emphasized that a simplistic rezoning or segregation of activities overlooks the deep interconnections between economic activities social networks and urban form in dharavi another critique of the project has been that it has proceeded without reliable statistics about dharavi’s population in response the government commissioned a baseline socioeconomic survey of the area in september 2007 managed by an ngo and implemented in part by slum dwellers the survey is currently under way
