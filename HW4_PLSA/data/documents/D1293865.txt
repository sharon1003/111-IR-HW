from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search for pharming on the internet see pharming for pharming in drug abuse see pharming parties pharming a portmanteau of farming and  pharmaceutical  refers to the use of genetic engineering to insert genes that code for useful pharmaceuticals into host animals or plants that would otherwise not express those genes thus creating a genetically modified organism gmo 1 2 pharming is also known as molecular farming molecular pharming 3 or biopharming 4the products of pharming are recombinant proteins or their metabolic products recombinant proteins are most commonly produced using bacteria or yeast in a bioreactor but pharming offers the advantage to the producer that it does not require expensive infrastructure and production capacity can be quickly scaled to meet demand at greatly reduced cost 5contents  hide 1 history2 in mammals21 historical development22 patentability issues3 in plants4 regulation5 controversy51 advantages52

protein pdp was human serum albumin initially produced in 1990 in transgenic tobacco and potato plants 6 open field growing trials of these crops began in the united states in 1992 and have taken place every year since while the united states department of agriculture has approved planting of pharma crops in every state most testing has taken place in hawaii nebraska iowa and wisconsin 7in the early 2000s the pharming industry was robust proof of concept has been established for the production of many therapeutic proteins including antibodies blood products cytokines growth factors hormones recombinant enzymes and human and veterinary vaccines 8 by 2003 several pdp products for the treatment of human diseases were under development by nearly 200 biotech companies including recombinant gastric lipase for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and antibodies for the prevention of dental caries and the treatment of nonhodgkins lymphoma 9several proteins were brought to market as research and bioproduction reagents mostly by sigmaaldrich prodi gene struck agreements with sigma to distribute prodi genes cornproduced aprotinin trypsin 10 betaglucuronidase gus and avidin large scale biology and sigma agreed that sigma would distribute lsbcs tobaccoproduced aprotinin sigma also agreed to distribute ventrias riseproduced lactoferrin and lysozyme however in late 2002 just as prodi gene was ramping up production of trypsin for commercial launch 11 it was discovered that volunteer plants left over from the prior harvest of one of their gm corn products were harvested with the conventional soybean crop later planted in that field 12 prodi gene was fined 250000 and ordered by the usda to pay over 3 million in cleanup costs this raised a furor and set the pharming field back dramatically 5 many companies went bankrupt as companies faced difficulties getting permits for field trials and investors fled 5 in reaction aphis introduced more strict regulations for pharming field trials in the us in 2003 13 in 2005 anheuserbusch threatened to boycott rice grown in missouri because of plans by ventria bioscience to grow pharm rice in the state a compromise was reached but ventria withdrew its permit to plant in missouri due to unrelated circumstances the industry has slowly recovered by focusing on pharming in simple plants grown in bioreactors and on growing gm crops in greenhouses 14 some companies and academic groups have continued with openfield trials of gm crops that produce drugs in 2006 dow agro sciences received usda approval to market a vaccine for poultry against newcastle disease produced in plant cell culture – the first plantproduced vaccine approved in the u s 15 16in mammals  edithistorical development  editmilk is presently the most mature system to produce recombinant proteins from transgenic organisms blood egg white seminal plasma and urine are other theoretically possible systems but all have drawbacks blood for instance as of 2012 cannot store high levels of stable recombinant proteins and biologically active proteins in blood may alter the health of the animals 17 expression in the milk of a mammal such as a cow sheep or goat is a common application as milk production is plentiful and purification from milk is relatively easy hamsters and rabbits have also been used in preliminary studies because of their faster breeding one approach to this technology is the creation of a transgenic mammal that can produce the biopharmaceutical in its milk or blood or urine once an animal is produced typically using the pronuclear microinjection method it becomes efficacious to use cloning technology to create additional offspring that carry the favorable modified genome 18 in february 2009 the us fda granted marketing approval for the first drug to be produced in genetically modified livestock 19 the drug is called atryn which is antithrombin protein purified from the milk of genetically modified goats marketing permission was granted by the european medicines agency in august 2006 20patentability issues  editas indicated above some mammals typically used for food production such as goats sheep pigs and cows have been modified to produce nonfood products a practice sometimes called pharming use of genetically modified goats has been approved by the fda and ema to produce atryn ie recombinant antithrombin an anticoagulant protein drug 21 these products produced by turning animals into drugmanufacturing machines by genetically modifying them are sometimes termed biopharmaceuticals the patentability of such biopharmaceuticals and their process of manufacture is uncertain probably the biopharmaceuticals themselves so made are unpatentable assuming that they are chemically identical to the preexisting drugs that they imitate several 19th century united states supreme court decisions hold that a previously known natural product manufactured by artificial means cannot be patented 22 an argument can be made for the patentability of the process for manufacturing a biopharmaceutical however because genetically modifying animals so that they will produce the drug is dissimilar to previous methods of manufacture moreover one supreme court decision seems to hold open that possibility 23on the other hand it has been suggested that the recent supreme court decision in mayo v prometheus 24 may create a problem in that in accordance with the ruling in that case it may be said that such and such genes manufacture this protein in the same way they always did in a mammal they produce the same product and the genetic modification technology used is conventional so that the steps of the process add nothing to the laws of nature that is not already present 25 if the argument prevailed in court the process would also be ineligible for patent protection this issue has not yet been decided in the courts in plants  editplantmade pharmaceuticals pmps also referred to as pharming is a subsector of the biotechnology industry that involves the process of genetically engineering plants so that they can produce certain types of therapeutically important proteins and associated molecules such as peptides and secondary metabolites the proteins and molecules can then be harvested and used to produce pharmaceuticals recently several noncrop plants such as the duckweed lemna minor or the moss physcomitrella patens have shown to be useful for the production of biopharmaceuticals these frugal organisms can be cultivated in bioreactors as opposed to being grown in fields secrete the transformed proteins into the growth medium and thus substantially reduce the burden of protein purification in preparing recombinant proteins for medical use 26 27 28 in addition both species can be engineered to cause secretion of proteins with human patterns of glycosylation an improvement over conventional plant geneexpression systems 29 30 biolex therapeutics developed a duckweedbased expression platform it sold that business to synthon and declared bankruptcy in 2012 additionally an israeli company protalix has developed a method to produce therapeutics in cultured transgenic carrot or tobacco cells 31 protalix and its partner pfizer received fda approval to market its drug taliglucerase alfa elelyso treatment for gauchers disease in 2012 32arabidopsis is often used as a model organism to study gene expression in plants while actual production may be carried out in maize rice potatoes tobacco flax or safflower the advantage of rice and flax is that they are selfpollinating and thus gene flow issues see below are avoided however human error could still result in pharm crops entering the food supply using a minor crop such as safflower or tobacco avoids the greater political pressures and risk to the food supply involved with using staple crops such as beans or rice regulation  editmain article regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms the regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops there are differences in the regulation of gm crops – including those used for pharming – between countries with some of the most marked differences occurring between the usa and europe regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering for example a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety controversy  editmain article genetically modified food controversies there are controversies around gmos generally on several levels including whether making them is ethical issues concerning intellectual property and market dynamics environmental effects of gm crops and gm crops role in industrial agricultural more generally there are also specific controversies around pharming advantages  editplants do not carry pathogens that might be dangerous to human health additionally on the level of pharmacologically active proteins there are no proteins in plants that are similar to human proteins on the other hand plants are still sufficiently closely related to animals and humans that they are able to correctly process and configure both animal and human proteins their seeds and fruits also provide sterile packaging containers for the valuable therapeutics and guarantee a certain storage life 33global demand for pharmaceuticals is at unprecedented levels expanding the existing microbial systems although feasible for some therapeutic products is not a satisfactory option on several grounds 8 many proteins of interest are too complex to be made by microbial systems or by protein synthesis 6 33 these proteins are currently being produced in animal cell cultures but the resulting product is often prohibitively expensive for many patients for these reasons science has been exploring other options for producing proteins of therapeutic value 2 8 16these pharmaceutical crops could become extremely beneficial in developing countries the world health organization estimates that nearly 3 million people die each year from vaccine preventable disease mostly in africa diseases such as measles and hepatitis lead to deaths in countries where the people cannot afford the high costs of vaccines but pharm crops could help solve this problem 34disadvantages  editwhile molecular farming is one application of genetic engineering there are concerns that are unique to it in the case of genetically modified gm foods concerns focus on the safety of the food for human consumption in response it has been argued that the genes that enhance a crop in some way such as drought resistance or pesticide resistance are not believed to affect the food itself other gm foods in development such as fruits designed to ripen faster or grow larger are believed not to affect humans any differently from nongm varieties 2 16 33 35in contrast molecular farming is not intended for crops destined for the food chain it produces plants that contain physiologically active compounds that accumulate in the plant’s tissues considerable attention is focused therefore on the restraint and caution necessary to protect both consumer health and environmental biodiversity 2the fact that the plants are used to produce drugs alarms activists they worry that once production begins the altered plants might find their way into the food supply or crosspollinate with conventional nongm crops 35 these concerns have historical validation from the prodi gene incident and from the star link incident in which gmo corn accidentally ended up in commercial food products activists also are concerned about the power of business according to the canadian food inspection agency in a recent report says that u s demand alone for biotech pharmaceuticals is expanding at 13 percent annually and to reach a market value of 286 billion in 2004 35 pharming is expected to be worth 100 billion globally by 2020 36list of originators companies and universities
