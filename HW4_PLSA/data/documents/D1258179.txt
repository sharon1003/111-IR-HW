hour crying hoping and praying that one person would ask him what was wrong he said he would have told them everything in a chilling diary entry another person who died by suicide left the message that if one person smiled at him on his walk that day he wouldn’t kill himself though the consequences can be fatal suicide is not a black or white issue suicidal people are often very ambivalent they are experiencing an inner debate between a part of them that wants to live their real self and a part that wants to die their antiself  reaching out and connecting with the part of them that wants to live can truly save a life when it comes to warning signs for suicide we are much better off overreacting than underreacting if you notice that a friend isn’t herself ie giving up interests seeking isolation or a family member is hinting at selfdestructive behavior or saying things like “you would be better off without me” you should take these warning signs seriously because suicidal individuals are almost always ambivalent they often give signs letting people know they are in trouble they may even hint at or admit that they’re contemplating hurting themselves then take it back and deny that they’re in danger therefore it is important that you take these signs seriously and help the person get to the help he or she needs we need to be proactive in offering assistance to individuals who we think might be considering suicide you can start by recognizing some of the red flags that would indicate the person is in trouble while there are longterm risk factors for suicide

are suicidal are in an anxious overactivated state in which they are anxious and agitated struggling with tolerating or regulating unbearable psychological pain they are desperate for a solution this can make it hard for them to sleep which in turn exacerbates the difficulty they are experiencing trying to calm these feelings down2 making preparations – any actions people take toward ending their lives should be taken seriously if a friend jokes that they’re going to kill themselves tomorrow the threat should not be taken lightly if they purchase a weapon or attain any dangerous substance these are serious signs they could hurt themselves if they’re giving away their possessions or saying goodbyes these are true causes for alarm3 sense of personalized hopelessness – if someone perceives their life or situation as hopeless they may be at risk keep in mind what may seem hopeless to them may not appear hopeless to you try to see the crisis through their point of view as they experience it4 talking about suicide – recent cdc statistics revealed that an estimated 83 million adults reported having suicidal thoughts in the past year while an estimated 22 million adults made
