history classes that the shah was a tinpot dictator installed by the cia to subdue iran’s leftists and secure american access to the country’s oil that he was extravagant and capricious that his secret police the savak tortured and spied with impunity much of this is probably true mohammad reza was definitely the intended beneficiary of an atleastattempted cia coup in 1953 and he was definitely a dictator though whether he was benevolent or tyrannical is debatable but i must admit to ambivalent feelings towards the shah and his government under the shah my grandmother gained the right to vote and to divorce her emotionally abusive opiumaddicted husband my relatives benefitted from his land redistribution and industrial profitsharing programmes my father learned to read from the shah’s literacy corps and received governmentsubsidised meals and textbooks so who am i to tell them that he was a lousy guy that he was a despot that his policies were too prowestern they don’t care about that they were starving and he gave them food that’s all they need to know in my household i was always taught that mohammad reza pahlavi and his father were the greatest leaders iran ever had my family loves the man like a grandfather or even a god growing up we always had a shir o khorshid in our house “every aspect of life was better then” my father loves to say “everyone was happier” when he comes to visit iran he blames every imperfection personally on khomeini the teller at the bank is rude khomeini the metro is late khomeini the internet is slow khomeini when he was growing up people were nicer food tasted better the azadi tower looked bigger anonymous why iranians are lapping up shah memorabilia the guardian 17 june 2015in the shah’s time when i went to italy

anonymous why iranians are lapping up shah memorabilia the guardian 17 june 2015to witness the collective dispossession of the nurtured tradition and way of life in an entire nation travel to iran the people of the country are being alienated from their cultural and ethnic roots and thus from their identity they have been denied all that is of merit in the west while their own values are corroded the cultural denuding thus involves a double alienation which gnaws at our vitals like a cancer reza baraheni 1977 the crowned cannibals writings on repression in iran p 5 iran is the country of the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich the lot of the majority of people in iran has not moved forward even an inch during the last fifty years of the pahlavi dynastys reign though the sevenyearold middleclass boy of fifty years ago namely the present shah of iran has grown to be one of the richest men on earth reza baraheni 1977 the crowned cannibals writings on repression in iran p 10 the reason most of my countrymen would tell you that they carry a grudge against the united states is that the u s government has given its unconditional support to a monarch who has terrorized a whole nation plundered its wealth and bought billions of dollars worth of military equipment which neither he nor our nation knows how to use iran is a dangerous quagmire in which the united states is sinking deeper and deeper the future will speak for itself but if iran becomes the new vietnam we can be sure that it was the inhumane and irresponsible policies of the u s government the excessive greed of american arms corporations and the extreme stupidity and adventurism on the part of present iranian authorities that led to the creation of that crisis in the history of humanity reza baraheni 1977 the crowned cannibals writings on repression in iran p 10 in iran one cannot stage hamlet richard iii or macbeth because no iranian should see the death of a prince or a king on the stage he might jump to conclusions as if contemporary iranian history itself is devoid of attempts at regicide reza baraheni 1977 the crowned cannibals writings on repression in iran p 11 it is a zoo in a glass tower there are no kings queens princes princesses generals ministers or secret agents here there are beasts instead nobody speaks the language of human beings here the gory shadows of these animals are reflected on the walls and mirrors the beasts hop up and down on the tiles and silk rugs howling bleating roaring mewing grinding their teeth and breathing savagely through their palpitating nostrils it is like being in a public bath with lepers the tails the muzzles the claws and paws rise in the air scratching at each other touching and twisting each other cornering buggering each other and sinking in an infernal abysmal pleasure are these mules jackasses apes leopards dragons sharks and gorillas the chosen members of our society is this zoo the ruling class of

guardian 12 august 2015i envisaged future generations of iranians proudly taking their rightful place among the vast family of nations and fulfilling their responsibilities with dignity i hoped to see dispelled for ever the medieval shadows from which iran had emerged only half a century ago and that the light which is the very essence of iranian civilization and culture would prevail throughout my reign i lived only for the realization of this dream which was beginning to become reality it will be seen that i worked tirelessly and keenly to this end i had ceaselessly to struggle against all sorts of obstacles and difficulties i had to confront innumerable plots and intrigues both inside the country and abroad i combated the allpowerful multinational trusts and cartels when all my advisers warned me against such challenges i may have made mistakes of course but this long battle was not one of them muhammad reza pahlavi 1980 the shahs story p 11 they say that martial law would have cost my country less than the bloody anarchy which is there now i can only reply that it is easy to play the prophet a posteriori and that a sovereign may not save his throne by shedding his compatriots blood a dictator can because he acts because he acts in the name of an ideology which he believes must triumph whatever the price but a sovereign is not a dictator there is an alliance between him and his people which he cannot break a dictator has nothing to hand over power lies in him and in him alone a sovereign receives a crown and it is his duty to pass it on muhammad reza pahlavi 1980 the shahs story p 182 i wanted to build up iran while we still had oil and thus to guarantee the life of the country after our oil reserves were exhausted therein lay the solution we had to move fast we had no time to spare finally it is unquestionable that the oil lobby contributed actively to my downfall muhammad reza pahlavi 1980 the shahs story p 201 it is evident that a lot of mistakes and excesses have been committed before the revolution i dont deny it on the contrary  there was evidently a lack of political liberty i dont deny either that the revolt was popular but those that spearheaded the revolution didnt want this result iran has regressed for twentytwo years i prefer to speak of the future history will judge what happened in the past reza pahlavi as quoted by
