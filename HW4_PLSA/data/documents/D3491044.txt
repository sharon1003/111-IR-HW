fitbit charge 2 review a great upgrade from the charge hr which has come far since launch tuesday september 12 2017by lily prasuethsut and james stableslilyhulkstablesjames when it comes to fitbits range of fitness trackers none are more powerful than the fitbit charge 2 it heralds a host of new features including guided breathing interchangeable bands a larger screen and new data tracking with vo2 max early verdict the fitbit ionic review while the alta hr keeps things simple and the blaze has its watchlike abilities the charge 2 is harder to categorise its definitely not a smartwatch but it does a lot more than many other fitness trackers price when reviewed12995check current price fitbit rolled into 2017 following a big streak dropping the fitbit alta fitbit alta hr and blaze earlier in 2016 it then went on to launch sequels to classic models with the fitbit charge 2 and the fitbit flex 2 we gave our initial verdict after a few weeks with the tracker but now weve spent a bit more time with it heres our longterm verdict of the fitbit charge 2 fitbit charge 2 design and comfort the charge 2 retains a very fitbitesque look taking cues from its predecessor as well as the fitbit alta and a little from surge its actually much sleeker than the others with a larger black and white oled screen thats four times bigger than on the old charge devices its also more fashionable looking with a polished silver body thats similar to the one on the alta hr it has the same clasp system as the charge charge hr but while this keeps it firmly in place its a bit fiddly and often requires a bit of extra force to slip the band through the display definitely feels big enough and sits better than the surge does on the wrist the overall design is pleasing perhaps because the display is larger than altas but still smaller than the surge and even the fitbit blaze which means you get to see a little more information without it being uncomfortably big coming soon the fitbit smartwatch for a device which requires so little user interaction its surprisingly complex to use metrics are scrolled by tapping on the touchscreen you can then cycle through modes by pressing the side button and then move through exercises by swiping down on the screen to access a mode you need to longpress the button you can tell that fitbit knows things are convoluted as hints on how to use the device appear on the screen during the first few hours of use it takes a little getting used to it is a little annoying that you cant scroll back and instead must keep tapping to get back round to a previous screen that you might have missed there arent a lot of screens to go through but its still a hassle if youre in a rush the sensitivity of the display is also little questionable at times its as if you need to be in a certain position for an arm turn to register and it doesnt always illuminate the screen when it should fitbit charge 2 rivals samsung gear fit2 review gear fit2 doesn’t fit in any category – which is why it succeeds garmin vivosmart 3 review watch out fitbit garmins going for an allrounder big verdict garmin vivosmart hrhands down the best fitness tracker for runners misfit ray review this reimagined tracker offers users more ways to wear1 2 3 4next the heart rate monitor on the back protrudes a bit but after using the charge 2 for quite a while we havent noticed it as much as we thought it would it might need a bit of adjusting to find the sweet spot but once its there its perfectly comfortable just behind the wrist bone is perfect for getting a read on the heart rate read next fitbit flex 2 review wearing it for more than just fitness is also definitely an option as the band can be switched out for nicer materials if you feel so inclined the 2995 classic band comes in black plum blue and teal and there are special editions including black with gunmetal body or lavender and rose gold which are pricier at 17995 like the alta the charge 2 will also get luxe leather accessory band options in brown blush pink and indigo which cost 6995 a gripe thats stood out over the longer term is the lack of waterproofing in fact were still quite surprised fitbit didnt include it on the charge 2 with the flex 2 offering a waterproof design the charge 2 is water resistant meaning its fine dealing with sweat and rain but fitbit doesnt recommend taking it in the shower which is annoying given how much the charge 2 does we feel like we should be able to take it into the pool too fitbit charge 2 activity tracking long pressing the side button starts tracking specific workouts manually and youll get a detailed summary in the app afterwards the charge 2 is also equipped with smart track which automatically recognises running cycling and more sleep is also autodetected along with floors climbed active minutes and hourly activity sleep tracking has been given the biggest overhaul since launch with the arrival of sleep stages and sleep insights which provide more indepth tracking and tips respectively weve found tracking to be accurate though not always perfect at nailing our wakeup times put up against the beddit 3 a dedicated tracker weve found that the scores have often been similar within under five minutes occasionally fitbit has struggled picking up the actual time we woke up – especially if we stayed in bed for a while  mistaking restless sleep for actually being awake however its been pretty good at recording bathroom breaks and the times weve fallen asleep and is substantial enough for a basic overview of each nights sleep with stages fitbit is now using our heart rate data to calculate our stages of sleep but its those insights we like best as fitbit gets to know you over time and starts delivering feedback thats more personal and useful as for step tracking you certainly couldnt accuse the charge 2 of being stingy testing the accuracy of step trackers isnt easy but weve definitely noticed the charge 2 overcounting we first noticed this when testing it over long distances against the garmin fenix 3 but in our longer term testing we also found it has a tendency to overestimate the charge 2 also misses some stair climbs this is an ongoing problem with other wearables that claim to count stairs and the charge 2 also struggles sometimes as mentioned the charge 2 has heartrate tracking built in so you wont have to worry about choosing between two variants the heartrate tracking uses fitbits pure pulse tech for continuous monitoring whether youre exercising or not theres no onboard gps and the charge 2 relies on connecting up with your phone using the connected gps feature to get pace and distance stats all these features can be found on the other fitbits in some form – but the vo2 max and guided breathing training are new vo2 max vo2 max in the fitbit app is labeled as cardio fitness level wearing your charge 2 to sleep to ensures the tracker measures your resting heart rate then it takes your user profile – age height weight and fitness data – to give you a score which is matched up against other people in your age group and gender you also get bar charts of your fat burn cardio and peak heart rate zones which makes for the most complete picture of your tickers data of any fitbit to date the data is slightly hidden and can only be accessed via the heart rate tab on the fitbit app dashboard unlike the resting heart rate cardio fitness level isnt tracked over time and is displayed as a single figure which you should see rising over time why fitbit didnt opt to plot cardio fitness level were not sure vo2 max is properly calculated with a fairly hardcore test in a sports science lab so the fitbit charge 2 is always going to offer something of an estimate it clocked us at 49 – close to the jabra sport pulse 47 and garmin fenix 3 48 and while it does appear at the higher end of the scale there are no complaints here we also let someone else borrow our fitbit for a day which caused the score to change which at least demonstrates a degree of sensitivity in the data the cardio fitness level feature is one of our favourite additions to the fitbit charge 2 its a proper fitness metric thats new to the companys ecosystem – and one that we hope to see evolve over time to become even more useful guided breathing breathing in deeply isnt a new concept for calming down thus fitbit didnt invent the wheel – rather its giving us a nice little tool to help us remember which is why the guided breathing has been a surprising but welcome feature at wareable weve already noticed a growing trend of mindfulness apps and wearables solely dedicated to managing stress read this the science behind fitbit and apples mindfulness push fitbit charge 2 personalises its guided breathing exercise by taking your heart rate to find a good rhythm making sure youre not inhaling too deeply or exhaling too quickly this is actually the debut of some serious new tech for fitbit and is the first time heart rate variability has been used on its devices you can also complete a two minute or five minute session for a moment of relaxation or use it to cool down after a workout after taking your heart rate the charge 2 readies you to breathe in time with a pulsing circle thats animated on the screen when we first used it to wind down after a workout we felt like we were doing it wrong – inhaling too deeply and practically holding our breath the second time we used it was to relax and destress this worked better and were able to breathe in time with the animation weve used it many times since in our longerterm test both for postworkouts and we like it the charge 2 has been able to accurately find the correct rhythm allowing us to follow the pattern on the little screen its oddly comforting watching the animations and after continuously using it two minutes flies by pretty quickly were also fans of the fact that there are no metrics making sure youre doing it correctly its there if you want it but if you dont thats ok heart rate training all eyes will be on the accuracy of the pure pulse heart rate sensor but disappointingly its still somewhat of a mixed bag on the charge 2 the good news is resting heart rate which was tracked with aplomb and matched up to our garmin vivosmart hr data we found the blaze often tracked rhr too high so this is an improvement over previous versions generally we found data from long steady runs to be useable – but the sensor took around 10 minutes to lock onto our heart rate when compared to a chest strap we also found that while generally accurate during steady and prolonged periods it had a tendency to underreport current heart rate often up to 5bpm and when it comes to hiit the charge 2 is more miss than hit we undertook a couple of high intensity sessions and ran into a few problems with the charge 2 interval woe fitbit charge 2 and garmin fenix 3 with chest strap first is the lag time which often meant that as we reached 180bpm on the first interval the charge 2 was stuck at 115 this usually improved as the session got underway but often the charge 2 was almost an interval behind however heart rate discrepancies with a chest strap were more apparent on the screen read out than the summary – like the fitbit algorithm made sense of the data after the event often long sessions ended up being only 3bpm out from a chest strap despite a stream of nonsense displayed live on the device during the workout since this fitbit has issued an update to improve some issues in the device including the gps which was spitting out some clear discrepancies beforehand in our longer term testing this has definitely improved but as with the blaze its still clear we have here is a device far better suited to everyday lifestyle use than for hardcore fitness fans despite the move to vo2 max the device isnt up to the rigours of hardcore training or high intensity sessions fitbit charge 2 notifications the charge 2 isnt a smartwatch and its not trying to hide this fact while youll get notifications you cant reply to them or review them on the fitness tracker – they simply disappear call text and calendar notifications can all be displayed on the charge 2 but your phone must be connected since our initial review whats app notifications have started working with the charge 2 but other thirdparty notifications are still mia from both i os and android for now read next which fitbit should you buy when receiving a call or text the charge 2 buzzes briefly then shows the phone number andor name of the person calling texts show a clipped version if the message is long and emojis cant be seen at all however a later update changed the way notifications appear with the message now showing ahead of the contact youll also now see a  sign indicating you have more than one notification other notifications youll see include reminders to move which debuted on the fitbit alta its the same concept where every hour youll get a little message telling you to take 250 steps fitbit charge 2 app if youve used a fitbit before than you should be familiar with the app which hasnt changed much for the charge 2 you get your usual graphs and dashboard items along with settings for each device thats paired and you can still view leaderboards whats new can be found in the challenges fitbit released the adventures challenge for its entire lineup so its not specific to the charge 2 but we tried it out anyway since it was announced at the same time the idea of adventures is pretty creative and fun there are different step goals for various adventure locations – for example it takes 15000 steps to walk on the yosemite vernal falls hike that means every step youre taking at home work wherever is then matched up to the hike fitbit has set up in the app you even get to see your steps mapped out with the app telling you how many more steps you need to go you dont have to complete the whole thing immediately though the app gives you a daily destination with points to meet based on your seven day step average fitbit has also since launched adventure races which lets you invite up to 30 friends to compete in the yosemite national park and new york city marathon courses the step goals you meet on the trail unlock a new panorama image that fitbits taken in real life called landmarks the company noted that these are about the same amount of steps youd need to take to actually reach the locations in real life after reaching one moving your phone out in front of you will let you pan around the image there are also treasures to discover which are just bits of trivia little health quizzes and motivation fitbit charge 2wareable may get a commission buy now amazon adventure has been enjoyable and really easy to get into since all you need to do is press start sometimes youll forget youve even begun the challenge so it would be nice if you could get notifications on the charge 2 screen letting you know you have goals to meet but aside from that we like seeing the maps route matching up to the usual steps you take each day wed definitely rather be hiking the actual steps in yosemite but this is fun too fitbit charge 2 battery fitbit says the charge 2 battery will last up to five days depending on use this was surprising since its the same battery life as the older charges which had a much smaller screen in comparison the alta hr gets about six days from our testing with every notification its able to receive turned on for fitness continuous heart rate sleep tracking and general daily usage weve managed to get about six days of life out of the charge 2 after charging it up for 1520 minutes it lasted another six days like the alta battery life thats better than expected its nice to know that well get almost a weeks worth of use from the charge 2 but itd be even better if there was a battery life indicator on the device itself the good news is that this is coming with a new update currently rolling out its been annoying having to check the app when it feels like the information should be available directly on the screen so were pleased this is now changing fitbit charge 2 longterm view we revisited the fitbit charge 2 back in december but since then fitbit has been padding it out with more updates and weve been living with the tracker to see how much its improved its still not perfect  hr tracking still falters at high intensity  but the charge 2 has come on a long way since it first launched the biggest since we last visited the charge 2 regards sleep as fitbit has rolled out its sleep stages and insights features to the device which gives users a more indepth look at their sleep behaviour while also serving up useful tips to improve it we really like that fitbit has built out the sleep aspect of the charge 2 without having to refresh the hardware and it makes the tracker much more capable weve also seen some tweaks to the ui to make notifications work better and generally make the charge 2 feel more intuitive weve also seen the arrival of the fitbit alta hr since but until the fitbit smartwatch touches down later in the year the charge 2 is the most wellrounded of the fitbit flock and its come on miles since we first got our hands on it were starting to see new ideas in trackers like the garmin vivosmart 3 which uses heart rate variability to measure stress but the charge 2 still outpaces many rivals with vo2 max and deeper sleep tracking and while wed ideally like builtin gps the fact you can get it via your smartphone means it still has a legup over much of the competition and its own tracker alternatives all things considered weve bumped up the charge 2s score by a star there are still improvements wed like to see in the charge 3 but this is the most capable fitbit tracker you can buy right now fitbit charge 2by fitbit the charge 2 is definitely a decent upgrade while it lacks the water resistance of the fitbit flex 2 and theres no dedicated gps its reasonable price tag and new feature set make it recommendable for most buyers with the additions of vo2 max breathing training and the slick design along with various band options the charge 2 is arguably fitbit’s most complete fitness band yet the updated sleep tracking is another string to its bow those looking to really get deep into their training are better served by specialist devices but the charge 2 is the most wellrounded fitness tracker you can buy right now hit good vo2 max data sleek design guided breathing affordable

questions does it have stairs on this tracker and can you get different color bands for this tracker i have the flex but i am wanting to upgrade i like pinkreply29aug2016 543 pm greg greg saysplease read the article before you ask silly questions reply29aug2016 911 pm alexander pd says yes on both your question it can still count stairs well floors and there is a darkpink version like the charge hr you can find all those information on the official fitbit charge2 page reply08sep2016 718 amyankee saysyes it has stairs tracker and you do get options of different color bands reply30aug2016 1253 amkeebster says will this finally track and incorporate your heart rate while you are sleeping this has seemed like a major blind spot with the others if both your heart rate and your movements was both used to track your sleeping i believe this would make it a lot more accurate reply03sep2016 814 amspeister saysyes the current charge hr tracks your heart rate while you sleep already and how many times you wake up during the night and are actually sleeping reply30aug2016 444 am david999 sayslooks pretty good if you dont take your phone with you when you go for a run can you still see distance youve run on the band display reply08sep2016 731 amyankee saysyes you can see how many steps you did and how many kilometers or miles you did on the band display without the need of a phone in fact you dont need the phone when you run for all key information reply11sep2016 1038 pm david999 says thanks yankee reply12sep2016 1240 pm08ashton saysare you able to see the length of time youve been exercising for i want to wear it for a marathon and be able to work out my pace without taking my phone with mereply05nov2016 1007 ambel70 says i would like the answer to that questions as well as i would prefer not to have to take my phone every time i go for a run reply30aug2016 839 amjangalang saysso how is this better than the blaze as your headline says besides being 20 dollars cheaper smaller and slightly easier to charge the breathing and cardio fitness might be added to the blaze with the new update but is there any other pros to get this over the blaze for 20 more the blaze can do a lot more with better screen and a less scratch resistant surface reply13sep2016 900 pm chicago ctb says per the official fitbit blog they have no plans to upgrade the blaze firmware with the new features reply01sep2016 131 pm retireland says im not a fan of the bigger screen and lets hope it doesnt scratch as easily as other versions reply07sep2016 1239 pm tha big jc says have you tried getting a smart phone screen protector cutting it to size and covering the screen i dont have a fitbit yet but thats what i would try doing reply08sep2016 729 amyankee says you can buy fitbit screen protectors available on ebay quite cheap they are specific to fitbit hr and other models reply02sep2016 1140 amsarahdd says does anyone know if the charge 2 band is made of exactly the same material as the charge hr i get skin irritation from the hr but seriously love wearing it and yes of course i wear it all the time  how else will i track my hr use the silent alarms to wake up in the morning and use the sleep tracker i regularly change wrists but ive had to add tape to the inside of the entire band reply27sep2016 518 pm naaria says the bands on the charge 2 are silicone vs the hr which was elastomer material whatever that means reply15oct2016 158 pm ilene says i had such horrible rashes from the charge hr then i bought the alta i didnt like it i will check out the differences between the silicone of the 2 to the elastomer of the one reply03sep2016 255 pmtoyabrown says im looking forward for this one i need to learn how to use the thing the right way reply08sep2016 751 pm fullstop says i have a nickel allergy so would be ok with the stainless steel clasp but does anyone know the composition of the rose gold option reply09sep2016 415 am jdonk says avoid fitbit i bought a fitbit charge for my wife at dick smith the first one did not work straight out of the box would not charge at all dick smith replaced immediately same day as purchase a few months later the new one stopped charging again dick smith replaced with a brand new item now 9 months later this 3rd fitbit charge will not charge the battery will not charge subsequently dick smith has closed down in my area so i can not return for a refund i contacted fitbit who are saying the original purchase is out of warranty but they will replace with the same model but will not refund they dont have enough faith in their own product to give a warranty on the brand new replacement fitbit charge thats only 9 months old i asked if the replacement they are willing to send will have a warranty but they didi not reply they also will not allow me to pay the difference to upgrade to a better model well if you ask me thats pretty poor they should write a book on how to lose customers because thats what theyve done in this situation not only me but everyone i know i tell how bad the product is and the lack of faith they have in their product i strongly recommend buying a more reputable brand fitbit is a waste of money and you will more than likely be disappointed reply15sep2016 539 pm the pilot saysare you kidding its a business look at how much youre asking for barely any company will give you a refund after 9 months the warranty is that they will replace it and they did why would they let you pay the difference for a newer one if they allowed that everyone would do that reply16sep2016 749 pmpkissel says jdonk had to replace the same product on day of purchase a few months later 2or3 and only 9 months after that this is a product that is supposed be worn every day to get the most benefit and its only lasting a max of 9 months on top of that consider the time hes wasted having to get product replacements and dealing with fit bits awful outsourced support getting good fit bits customer service is a crap shoot at best i think its reasonable to expect more from a product in this industry its not secret that fit bit is known for their shoddy build quality problems and poor after sales support when inevitably the product breaks like jdonk says avoid fitbit his experience mirrors many other fit bit users myself included who have decided to move away from fit bit i really miss many things about fit bit ive owned 4 devices but the overall experience didnt make it worth sticking around reply16nov2016 828 pm demobstar says i have just returned my second fitbit to the store and moving on to another device it really is not worth the hassle considering the price shame really as i did like the product but it is clearly not very well built and after sales service is beyond ridiculous needless to say im not the only person struggling with the device reply13sep2016 544 pmmkj says when you review the charge 2 please test outdoor readability in direct sunlight the alta does a terrible job with that its just not bright enough and is altas biggest flaw hopefully they fixed that with charge 2 reply17sep2016 310 am mnwareable says id like to focus on the battery life and band i own a fitbit flex i was really pleased with the performance and the interfaceapp seeing the degree of company customer support was also encouraging however the band quality became a problem due to the logistics of removing and replacing the unit for charging cracks soon began to appear near the bend this lead naturally to the eventual breaking of the band a replacement band lasted about another year then a third towards the beginning of the second year the battery began to fail and will no longer retain a charge longer than about 2 hours it seems a number of others have had similar problems i would like to upgrade to the fitbit charge 2 now it seems but my biggest concern is that battery issues remain with these units has this been fixed in the latest iteration has the band quality issue been resolved its not a huge investment of money but my flex still ended up costing me about 10month averaged out over the two years it was working a little pricey and has left my confidence shaken regards mnreply17sep2016 741 am fitter guinea pig says my final verdict received it a week ago  sent it back outdoor readability in direct sunlight is zero you need to go into the shade to read the data the connected gps status can only be checked after starting a walk or run therefore the first waypoints are often far off the real track there is no possibility to set the display to always on during a walk or run reply17sep2016 1036 pmmilo says i wonder how well the band material in the charge 2 will hold up compared to the band on the hrat the six month mark the band on my charge hr started to bubble and peel away from the display within warranty fitbit authorized a new unit to be sent to me the one they sent did not work at all so they dispatched another uniti have been wearing the replacement unit for seven months and the band started to bubble and peel away from the display a few weeks ago i did not contact fitbit as i was told my replacement would only be covered under the warranty time frame of my original unit which would have been out of warranty at the end of june 2016 i am sure it will only be a few more weeks before the piece becomes unwearable due to the band falling apartdoes anyone know if this is a product flaw that was taken care of with the release of the new product linethanks reply19sep2016 254 am jessi says do not waste your money and timei bought it today and it wont even work to set it up i already spent one hour on the phone with costumer service and they have to send me a dongle to make this work i am so disappointed with the new fitbit charge 2 best buy didnt even have it out yet but got it from the back i will let them know how shitty this product is before they sell it to anyone else reply19sep2016 327 pmjohnandrewriley says in summary  absolute rubbish i put up with one for a week and heres why it serves three functions1 measure your activity  for me it over measured for example it clocked up 38 km one morning and i hadnt even left the house2 measure your heart rate it worked fine when i wasnt doing anything but really thats not the point is it when i was going a work out my chest belt which i was using as a comparison would return 140bpm the useless piece of black plastic was happily returning 60bpm at which i shouldnt have even been breaking sweat i can assure you i was a mess3 monitor sleep well no way of telling if its working or not really but one evening whilst watching telly it said i had gone to bed at 930 i was pretty motionless but not that so in my view an absolute epic fail and i havent even mentioned how uncomfortable it is to wear  it would be better if i shaved my arms but as i dont it kept pulling my arm hair oh and before i forget its supposed to turn the display on when you tilt your arm to look at it it only works if you use a dartagnon like flourish to wake the bloody thing up good for your exercise but you look pretty daft i wont comment on the quality of the interface oh ive done itany way this would have all been fine if when i contacted fit bit to talk them through the problems they had responded in a positive way two things really riled me firstly the agent tried to tell me that i shouldnt be making comparisons between different devices im sorry how else would you work out if its actually working secondly after agreeing finally that it wasnt working properly they made me pay for the return so i could get a refund £10 because i had to return it to the netherlands  which probably also points to some dodgy tax planning also useless black plastic dont buy reply11apr2017 214 amwythnosau says my fitbit charge hr has just fallen apart after 3 years use it was ok but ridiculous looking and very hard to check time when working outdoors on the farm it seemed to run out of battery every 36 hours then take ages to recharge i though it was really ridiculous that if i waved my arm around while driving in our mountainous area it thought i was super granny good for a laugh but less amusing was the tackiness the little plastic strip and button across the back and sides fell off due to poor design and the need for constant recharging ie pulling the charger lead in and out for my replacement i will be researching carefully before updating to another fitness tracker to fit my wish list1 waterproof for pool swimming  my

reply20sep2016 1252 pm unknown21 saysi love my new fitbit charge 2 so amazing not much i can fault only thing is it can get a little bit uncomfortable at times due to the tracker on the back of the device it tends to dig in and make marks on my skin however a slight adjustment now and then helps but i do love itreply22sep2016 1217 pm get wellable says it doesnt sound like this device or the

outside in the bright sun not responsive to taps to change displays not response of quickview unless you turnraise your arm just right i use the alarm function on my charge hr to wake me up in the am and for medication reminders throughout the day even though i set 5 alarms 1 minute apart the charge 2 still wont wake me up because the vibration is so weak and i miss about 12 of my daily notifications if im distracted given that this is a larger device i cant figure out why they would decrease the intensity of the vibration even though i got a great deal on the price due to a pricing error on amazon i still dont think its worth the upgrade from a charge hr if you have one thats still functional squared buckle instead of rounded catches on shirt sleeves covers etc charging clamp is cumbersome as with every other wrist based fitbit it still records steps while driving but none of my vivosmarts haveno idea why the metal sides of the unit to not extend to the top so even with a screen protector i can guarantee that within weeks i will have chipped the angular exposed edge of the screen all the screen protectors ive seen to date to not extendfold over the edge i think this will be a major issue long term the alarm is very important feature to me and since the basis peak has gone the way of the dinosaur i guess ill wait and see how the new pebble time 2 hr works outreply28sep2016 447 pm chrissy36 saysdoes it fit the same way as a fitbit hr charger wondering if i needed the same size reply28sep2016 457 pm chrissy36 says i plan to purchase one but does the band fit the same way as a hr charger wondering if i need to go up on the size reply29sep2016 1146 pm jrsmtith says just putting this question out to you guys has fitbit a mayor problem with the charge 2 its a nice device and my wife loves it for a week now it cant be synced and paired to neither app or pcmac fitbit support keep promising us that an expert will contact us  this was 3 days ago and nothing comes back even with daily reminder this kind of behaviour is bit suspicious to me and might be part of a bigger problem reply02oct2016 1038 pmparker says the same thing happens with my charge hr i have to reset the fit bit and phone for it to resync it seems that any time i connect my phone to any bluetooth speaker which is every day that the charge is from that point on locked out i can connect to any other bluetooth device just not the charge so i reset the charge and reset the phone and then they pair back up quite a hassle reply11oct2016 204 am aml says i purchased a charge 2 and spent a bunch of hours trying to pair it with my pc checked the support pages tried numerous resets reboots etc talked to their phone support a couple of times my pc bluetooth showed the charge 2 as being paired but the app would not sync which tells me that this is a problem of the charge 2 software i was asked if i had an i phone or i pad to sync it with i dont perhaps folks with i os devices have a better experience with the charge 2 than i did although i see a lot of comments that syncing is very poor on any platform i was so irritated that i returned the charge 2 and will not purchase any fitbit product in the future reply14oct2016 1239 pmmtz39 says i never write reviews i bought this product without looking at the reviews and regret it the steps are counting in my sleep while driving and while watching tv i get up in the morning and have 500 steps support basically told me to everything in the instructions like wearing it loose and turning it off and on then they stopped responding when the issues were not fixed i do crossfit and after my workouts we are typically on the floor gasping for air the heart beat monitor registers my heart rate the same as if im just lifting weights that cant be possible in short this product is defective its not worth the money i am sending it back reply15oct2016 512 pm sebk says i was given the charger2 as a gift and was excited to try it out after reading the reviews i am having the opposite issue w the steps counter it only counts steps if i am really stepping out when i go for a walk those steps get counted but not my other steps its tilt and quick read only works some of the time and sleep tracking is not at all accurate i know my sleep patterns are weird and i dont sleep well so i was hoping this feature would more accurately report my sleep hours i regularly reports 89 hrs of sleepreply20oct2016 238 pmjpru says there is one major flaw in this fitness tracker they make it almost impossible to read the screen when you are working out you have to tap the screen 23 times or they boast about the fact that it will go on when you flick your wrist sometimes you just cant flick your wrist and you have to do it multiple times to get it to turn on in both scenarios it only turns o for 3 seconds not very usefull reply28oct2016 231 amtahale saysin the review it was said annoyingly there are no settings you can adjust on the tracker itself for sleep mode or dimming the screen so tossing around in bed leads to the screen lighting up the room you can indeed adjust that in settings in the app switch off the quick view mode and it wont light up when you toss and turnjust thought that i should mention reply30oct2016 755 am chuckecheese says i replaced my 5th charge hr with charge 2 too many issues to list with charge hr but average length of time before each one needed to be replaced was 34 months so disappointed that its still not swim  water proof there is no pause during a workout there is a stopwatch but no countdown timer there are no 3rd party notifications there are no music controls interval training is only for time not also distance there are no alarms when you are training outside hr zones there is no way to track laps either manual or automatic there is still no onscreen battery meter other than when about to diemaybe i should have gotten a garmin vivosmart hr insteadreply15nov2016 717 pmsam6596 says so it says this version doesnt have a gps what does the gps do that makes it a bad thing to not have it reply16nov2016 843 pm demobstar says i just returned my second fitbit and im moving on to another device the first lasted less that four months and the second lasted less than three months before they simply both stopped working the first stopped charging and the second displayed a flat line that would not go away fortunately they are still under warranty and i can get my money back very sad as i did like the device when it worked it however is a very badly constructed product reply02dec2016 250 am elio sayswas very disappointed with the fitbit charge 2 im a truck driver and it added 57 floors climbed while i was driving for two and a half hours never got out of the truck and supposedly i climbed 57 floors it adds thousands of steps when not moving while youre driving would not recommend this product to anyone 1 who has a car or drives for a living because it will not track you good at all i returned it after 2 days very disappointed in this product would definitely not recommend it to anybody to buy this product its a big waste of money

i and decided to buy a fitbit blaze this was in hope if i bought a better one it might last longer while the other lasted a year this one only worked for 3 months what the heck yes i took it back and while i was unable to get a refund they gave me a new one im pretty unhappy that a 20000 dollar watch only lasted 3 months also just to add no im not a construction worker i work in an office reply22dec2016 420 pmdawndalla says i just bought the fitbit charge 2 recently and i have not been able to receive text notifications at all to my iphone 7 i have trouble shooted with customer service and fitbit techs and noone can figure it out 2 weeks later and it still doesnt work mine is faulty and instead of sending out a replacement the keep dragging it out saying that my issue has been forwarded to a higher up technical dept i cant understand why they dont see the unit has an issue reply25dec2016 702 pmyuriryzhenkov says material looks like shit i remember it from failed nike fueldband sereply31dec2016 138 pmcdanderson says where can i buy the authentic bands for fitbit charge 2 at discounted price besides ebay or amazon reply03jan2017 1140 pmumtycl says not satisfied with the quality at the first time charging it stopped working and does not turn on the return is a hassle and fitbit does not cover for the return shipping reply03jan2017 1141 pmumtycl says for fitbit charge 2reply11jan2017 303 pm old duffer says my family purchased the fitbit charger 2 as a christmas present for me to track my heart ratedistance walked as i have afib i sweat at the drop of a hat and the rubberized wrist band is very uncomfortable if its uncomfortable in december hate to think of what it will be like in july i understand that it maybe needed because of people exercising that the band will last longer i use to go thru allot of wrist watches until i switched to a pocket watch and now use my cell phone for checking what time it is i looked for other alternative bands and only see colors of the same material also the sensor that protrudes off the back leaves an indentation on my wrist after wearing it and the sweat adds to the discomfort ive tried to adjust the tightness of the wrist band but to no avail shame it does a nice job and connected to my iphone and the readouts are helpful as they say back to the drawing board reply20jan2017 1250 am ally says dont buy  the heartrate tracking does not work on the dashboard app known fault for well over 6 months even before the rollout of the charge2 lots of unhappy users on their fitbit forum the support team has not fix in sightreply02feb2017 1006 pmgeorge1952 says you need to do reveiw again this charge 2 is a piece of junk this from their forum this thread should not be marked as solved i have just finished a live chat with support and they have admitted that there is a problem with the charge 2 that the engineering team are working on it and there is no forseeable date for a fix while this problem is occuring the charge 2 is not useful as a training tool and as such is not fit for purpose the connect gps is very poor does not record distance correctly on treadmillrunningbiking or walking reply12feb2017 517 pm miss kclynn says so how much did they pay you not to say anything about the fact that it doesnt sync with certain huawai devices huawei p9 and p9 lite in particular and nothing has been done about this for over a year despite hundreds of thousands of complaints and etremely unsatisfied customers reply11mar2017 1144 pmkbh says is the device in the band the same way it was in the original hr my band lasted 5 months before the plastic split and no longer charging it was replaced by the company with what i think is a refurbished model the battery only 1 12 days that was replaced with another refurbished and that was replaced with a new hr that one went 8 months then the small charger band fell off this device looks like a big improvement but it is worthless if the band was never improved reply16mar2017 241 amyenpham says im having a fitbit charge 2 at the moment and i quite unhappy with it the first one did not remind me to move after 10 minutes i claim to the shop and they changed for me another one when i sit down to watch tv or woking with my computer the steps still count the movement on my wristhand even when im not walking for example i went to the cinema it was 9975 steps when i sat down and while half movie was played the watch show notification to congratulation i reached 10000 steps both watches i used and have being using have this problem does anyone have this problem like me reply30mar2017 111 am peta1 says i used the charge2 for 3 weeks reasonably happy with the features except the ultra bright leds used to disturb my sleep even with notifications turned off i had to stop using it because the band size and shape caused it to bear down on the outer bone on my wrist it became so agonisingly sore that i could not wear it even when i padded the band with felt my wrist is no longer painful after not wearing it for a week i think i will use a phone app instead reply01apr2017 1255 am demull says ive gone through two fit bit charge hrs and had issues where after a several months it falls apart where you connect it to charge the first one they said i needed to return it in the original packaging and with the receipt of course after 3 months i threw them both away and this happened at the 6 month mark so my husband bought me another one that one only lasted 5 months dont feel like going through that again its too bad too because otherwise i loved it anyone else with this issue reply01apr2017 219 am bob m2 says my experience with the charge2 is very different that wareables and there are page after page of complaints on the fitbit website regarding inaccurate step counting and poor hr monitoring it is so inaccurate and so erratic it is worse than useless take the heart rate sensor during interval training on an elliptical its readout varies pretty much randomly from 30 bpm above to 20 bpm below my actual measured heart rate sometimes it’s spot on but i’m reminded that a stopped clock is right twice a day on a treadmill at a fast walking pace it consistently reads 20 to 30 bpm below actual i do weight training 5 to 6 days a week and during a 60 to 80minute workout it will routinely vary as much as 20 bpm too high and 30 too low intermittently it shows an hr as much as 40 50 and more bpm below actual the largest discrepancy had the charge 2 displaying 80 bpm when my actual was 149 sixtynine bpm to low ive also seen it go from 15 bpm too high to 30 bpm too low in less than a minute and jump from 97 to 117 bpm while im looking at the display today in the middle of weight training it showed my hr as 62 bpm that’s lower than my resting hr oh and some days i apparently die multiple times during a workout because the display repeatedly shows  the fitbit community forum is filled with complaints about the hr sensor the charge 2s step counter isnt much better in controlled testing walking the indoor track at my gym its wildly inaccurate i did 12 tests 4 each of 30 50 and 100 steps in two tests it was with about 5 percent in one it undercounted by 10 that means if you walk 10000 steps itll only credit you with 9000 and in the remaining 9 it undercounted by 30 to 35 that means that for a 10000 step day youll only be credited with 6500 to 7000 it’s not consistent though sometimes it overcounts by about 5 it also give me credit for steps while i’m sitting on the couch folding laundry and when i’m scratching my head and this is under the best conditions walking a moderate pace nothing in my hands my arm swinging freely if you’re carrying something that interferes with arm movement it’s even worse push a shopping cart or baby stroller and it won’t count steps at all because your arm isn’t moving and again the forums are filled with complaints about the inaccurate step count on a typical day i climb between 10 and 15 flights of stairs and the charge 2 fails to count 2 to 4 of them if you hold on to the handrail while climbing it won’t count the climb but it also randomly misses other flights of steps even when i’m don’t hold the rail occasionally though it’s wildly optimistic it counted 18 flights while i took a 30minute motorcycle ride and 2 flights while i drove home from the gym i wouldnt put much stock in its sleep analysis either since it gives me credit for 50 to 150 steps every night while im sleeping no i dont walk in my sleep and since the inputs are inaccurate none of the calculated values can be trusted calories burned is estimated from heart rate and activity if those numbers are off it’s likely calories burned is off too heart health is calculated from resting and peak heart rates how can one trust those numbers even minutes of activity is questionable if the fitbit thinks my hr was only 62 during exercise it’s probably not counting that as activity but its automatic activity detection did credit me with 20 minutes of aerobic activity while i was dozing in bed the other morning it might as well be a random number generator for all the actual value it provides and fitbits customer support is worse than useless theyre more likely to argue with you than to help you if they don’t argue they just keep repeating the same worthless suggestions reply03apr2017 657 pmredtree says ive had the charge 2 for about three month and now im starting to notice more issues with it the main features i use are the step counter heart rate monitor and sleep log i had the opposite problems with steps i dont know if it was undercounting before but it definitely does now i walk the same route every day and its about 6200 steps now im lucky if this thing counts 5000 the heart rate monitor typically doesnt work when im active just when im sedentary which is somewhat useless i cant say anything about the sleep log i dont know how accurate it is reply10apr2017 1145 amdocjim says redtree is talking about a problem that is becoming huge for many fitbit charge 2 users i have the device primarily for sleep monitoring and stages has never worked on the device even worse the features that used to be present sleep efficiency for example are no longer available the company is providing only the vaguest response to the many complaints posted on their community pages and the helpdesk seems to not have a clue about what is going on im among many unhappy charge 2 users reply24apr2017 636 pm merrilee says this is my second fit bit charge it is the fitbit charge 2 i am very disappointed in it i do not remember having this problem with my first one all it does is measure how many times i wave my arm around i spoke to a rep on the phone and he confirmed that is what it does so when i go to the grocery store and have my hand on the cart no measurement when i walk upstairs and have items in my hand no measurement but if i am driving in my car or laying on my bed and move my arm wildly in the air wall i am getting credit for steps even on the treadmill if i speed up and want to hold onto the armrails no measurement this sucks i like getting texts on it but i want a tracker not a device that measures my arm movements also many of my reports have been inaccurate i know which days i had more activity like when i was on vacation and walked a lot and the report showed a day i hardly moved reply25apr2017 147 am dezza says i was given a charge 2 for christmas at first i was impressed however now that i have done some homework and looked more closely at the data it provides i have come to the conclusion that it is deeply flawed if you want accurate data then look elsewhere if on the other hand you are happy to use it as a general guide then the charge 2 is easy to wear and inexpensive just dont look too closely at the data forget any information based on resting heart rate it is miles off the mark rhr is supposed to be measured first thing in the morning after a good night sleep today for example the charge 2 app shows 81 bpm rhr it was 58 bmp this morning as displayed on the charge 2 unit however the app shows that my lowest bpm today was 62 bpm fitbit try to explain away these issues as averagingrounding today my cycling exercise was yet again incorrectly recorded dropping off the last 15 minutes when i am peddling i cant keep looking at the wrist unit so i cant tell you why this 15 minutes has blended into the background but i can say as a software developer of 30 years experience that averaging  rounding is simply smoothing over data that does not exist in other words the device failed good luck if you are moving your arms a lot running perhaps reply31jul2017 135 pm
