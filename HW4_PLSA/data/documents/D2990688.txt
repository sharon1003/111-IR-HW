cant find a reputable source on how long adderall ir the instant release thats available in both brandname and generic forms lasts my doctor said 810 hours but most people seem to say 34 hours i get up at 630 am and go to bed at 1100 pm and i need the medication from 7001100 pm thats a time period of 16 hours if the medication lasts only for 34 hours then ill need to take the medication 4 times a day so do i really need it only twice a day as its prescribed now or do i need it 4 times a day thanks 2 032309 0907 pmscarletta contributor join date dec 2008location minneapolis mnposts 487thanks

2008location baltimore mdposts 673thanks 18thanked 217 times in 149 posts re how long does adderall ir last tried so many sources ir medication is definitely not supposed to last 810 hours your doc must have been talking about xr usually a dose of adderall ir lasts 46 hours like scarletta said some people can feel it wearing off after 3 hours while some people can get 65 hours out of it i can usually get 45 hours from one dose provided im getting enough sleep at night even if youre awake from 630 am to 1100 pm do you really need full coverage from your meds that whole time its usually best to let yourself wind down for about 2 hours before you go to bed so if your last dose wears off around 900 or 930 that would be fine and in the morning you probably dont need the meds to kick in until you start work or school so time your first dose about 45 minutes before the start of work or school like i have a really long day because my commute to work is 15 hours each way so i wake up at 530 leave the house at 615 and arrive at work at 745 i dont take my first dose until 715 which is usually when i arrive at the metro then i have a 30minute metro ride which gives my meds time to kick in by the time i get to work im just starting to feel it after all i really dont need my meds when im just getting dressed and driving to the metro you might need 3 doses a day many people take 2 regular doses and then a 3rd smaller dose later in the day so it doesnt keep them awake at night but its not likely that youd need 4 doses every day sponsored links 4 032309 1023 pmyoonjb newbie join date feb 2009location anaheim hills caposts 3thanks 0thanked 16 times in 1 post re how long does adderall ir last tried so many sources i see thanks a lot for the quick response are the following symptoms normal for a person who has adhd hyperactive and impulsive and inattention its really easy for me to focus when im in class and listening to lecture but i must be sitting near the front on the other hand its really hard to focus when i am by myself trying to studydo my homework i think this is why i didnt find out about my adhd until so late i have an iq in the range of 155 155 deviation 170 ratio so school came pretty naturally to me i struggled mightily with getting homework essays projects done but i had virtually no problems when i was physically in school i think its because i needed external stimulation in order to focus  if the external source of stimulation goes away being by myself then my adhd symptoms start to show up and i cant concentrate is this normal because i didnt really show adhd symptoms in the classroom adhd was never suspected even worse because i was so physically activeplayed lots of sports growing up my hyperactivity and inattention was all manifested outside the classroom during recess and after school activitiessports so when i was inside the classroom my energies were already expended and i calmed down when i didnt exerciseplay sports there was a definite spike in adhd symptoms and vice versa exercise isnt a cure for me but it helps tremendously in other words adhd symptoms showed in the classroom only when i didnt play sportswasnt active outside the classroom but adhd symptoms always were there outside school when doing homework at home etc seems like i need the medication only when im outside class  does everything that i have described above seem within the normal range for adhd also a question are people with adhd both hyperactivityimpulsivity and inattention more extroverted or is the extroversionintroversion dimension independent of whether one has adhd sometimes it seems to be that adhd is pathological extroversion 5 032409 0349 amdark code addvanced member join date dec 2007location northern california posts

the day but it leaves behind residual effects that keep me going for the rest of the day i workout everyday so i have to be careful about my heart rate approaching my max hr when i go for runs so i dont redose during the day but exercise can help it last longer so will eating healthy having plenty of protein and complex carbohydrates in your diet etc the following user says thank you to dark

adderall ir last tried so many sourcesyoonjb all of that sounds normal for someone with adhd when youre in class the teacher and your seat near the front force you to sit still and pay attention so it makes sense that your symptoms are easier to control in class and when youre alone theres nothing to direct your thoughts so of course your mind wanders a lot of adhd people cant study or do their homework unless they have music playing or the tv on in the background like you said they need external stimulation to help them focus it kind of blocks out the racing thoughts i think people with adhd tend to be more extroverted its hard not to be when youre bouncing off the walls lol but people with inattentive add tend to be more introverted since theyre usually daydreaming lost in their own thoughts i can only use myself as an example but im 100 inattentive type and im definitely an introvert im perfectly fine socially no one would describe me as shy but im quiet and reserved not effusive like many adhd people are youre a combination type but many combo people lean more towards the hyperactive side or maybe the hyperactive symptoms are just more obvious and harder to control

times in 508 posts re how long does adderall ir last tried so many sources i take ir four times a day  roughly at 6 am 10 2 and 5 or 530 it tends to become less effective as the day goes on at least for me so thats why the last doses are closer together i go to bed pretty early and its just wearing off at that point i think they say it will last up to 6 hours but 3 12 to 4 is much more common from what ive gathered not everyone needs it all day long it just depends on how you were functioning in different areas of your life before for me everything was mess  work housework creative pursuits even just pure leisure time basically my symptoms were so severe i wasnt functioning well in any area thus the morning till bedtime med schedule thankfully my doc understood this and is supportive of me taking it four times a day if i stayed up later id probably need even one more dose but i am fanatical about getting 8 or 9 hours a night youll understand soon enough that there are

broad time period i sometimes consider spacing my dose 810 hours the dose tends to linger depending on stomach conditions and tolerance usually the peak comes about 25 hours into the pill i found that the ideal situation is to find a good 2x daily ir dose i take 15mg twice daily usually never passed 3pm latest 4pm on occasion i have night classes but i got over the urge to save my 2nd dose remember amphetamines are addicting they  you up lol i dont even like to take more than im prescribed anymore i am content with this dose for now and i dont want to go higher do what i did try increasing your morning and afternoon dose 5mg each day and find a dose that works best for you the lower the better tho i assume if you were prone to abuse youd do it anyhow i feel like i am legally addicted absent being the image of a drug addict trust me dont take 4 if you start you may not be able to lower in the future 9 120310 0129 amnaussicaa addvanced contributor join date mar 2010location chicago posts

long does adderall ir last tried so many sources im the same way as you yoonjb i say that way too much on this forum i excelled in school up to my sophomore year in high school because of my high iq and ability to beat the system that is u s public schooling once i started taking college level classes i slipped things like reading and taking notes were torture and no matter how long i spent on stuff i didnt retain anything i saw a psych and got diagnosed by my regular doc between sophomore and junior years i took ritalin and i now take adderall i need the medication for just as long as you need it  from 7am to around 10pm or sometimes the weehours of the next morning i take an xr in the morning and an ir booster in the afternoonevening i enjoy taking the xr a bit later because it doesnt last as long as it should the ir is a tossup sometimes it lasts all afternoonnight and sometimes it doesnt work at all even after i take two within a couple hours i personally like to take caffeine with my meds even though its illadvised because i believe it keeps me from taking too much by this i mean that it gives me more energy and the focus which assures my mind that i dont need to take any more its odd but it works the one thing i can always count on no matter the effectiveness of the ir is that ill be tossing around my bed for a couple hours before i fall asleep i think its my anxiety rather than the meds but without fail ill be listening to my heartbeat for quite a while before actually drifting off 12 120710 0249 pmjester banned tournaments won 1join date dec 2010location canada posts 662thanks 84thanked 182 times in 132 posts re how long does adderall ir last tried so many sources another question nobody can answer above a certain concentration the effects of the drug will cross your therapeutic threshold and you will feel alert and focused for me a 20mg dose lasts 8 hours 15 mg dose lasts 5 hours 10mg dose lasts 1 hour and less then 10mg i dont feel any improvement at all if i take 100mg at once the effects will last for 2 days bottom line it depends on each individual however if you are prescribed the right amount which is rarely the case you should remain focused and working for 7 hours 13 120910 0351 pmw2wgamer newbie join date dec 2010location redlands caposts 1thanks 0thanked 0 times in 0 posts re how long does adderall ir last tried so many sources quote

hyperactivityimpulsivity and inattention more extroverted or is the extroversionintroversion dimension independent of whether one has adhd sometimes it seems to be that adhd is pathological extroversion i am guessing that you are lot like me and i wondered the same thing during college i barely attended class did only a fraction of the homework and hardly ever studied the only times when i felt that i was actually studying to my potential was when i was either physically exhausted or stressed beyond belief right before tests or finals when it became clear how much i had slacked off i would always get as on the tests but homework and lab grades would always consistently drag me down luckily thanks to the mcat i was still able to make it into medical school this is when i finally decided to get tested for adhd and got prescribed adderall ir 20mg bid or two times a day ever since then i feel like i can reach my potential without having to be physically drained or stressed although each day in medical school seems to have the stress of finals week in college haha i have been playing around with the meds and tried to see what works best for me at the suggestion of my psychiatrist i just got my dose upped to three times a day for me i am really able to feel the effects in the afternoons after my second dose but the first dose does not seem to be as effective i think i am going to start taking 30mg in the morning twenty at noon and 10 booster at around 4 my theory on the extraversion that seems to go along with adhd patients is that the extraversion is merely a side effect of the need for constant stimulus and many times people are the only sources of stimulus present so adhd patients grow up learning how to involve others to be a source of stimulus i know your post was a long time ago but i hope this helps i kinda wish i had started the medication back in college but at the same time i like being adhd and random and sometimes i feel like i cant be while on the meds so i think it is only when your methods of compensation are not able to keep up with the tasks that you need to complete that you need medication i would suggest only 2 dosages of ir to people unless you are doing 1214 hour work days each day like i am hope this helps 14 013011 0902 ampillwizard302newbie join date jan 2011location alabama posts 1thanks 0thanked 0 times in 0
