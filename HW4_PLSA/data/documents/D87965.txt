support such as the costs of day care health insurance support for children born before the children at issue and extraordinary medical or other expenses child support law in colorado can get complicated when both parents are not in fulltime salaried positions as an example if a party is selfemployed the colorado family law court must analyze what business expenses are legitimate and they are not necessarily the same deductions as the irs may allow other complications under colorado state child support law are the uncommon situations where the children are divided between the parents households  one lives with the mother and another with the father child support in colorado is not simply a wash  instead it requires calculating multiple colorado child support worksheets taking care

deviations from the colorado child support guidelines are permissible for good cause underemployed parent if a party is unemployed or underemployed colorado child support law may impute income to a person who took a job in bad faith to shirk hisher child support obligations ie pretend that the party earns more than heshe really earns people v martinez 69 p3d 1029  colo 2003 an extreme example of that would be a neurosurgeon working at a gas station thereby working way below hisher potential income level at a minimum an ablebodied parent should expect to have minimum wage imputed to himher

calculators you can calculate your own colorado child support on these sites but remember these caveats  first they may not be up to date with statutory changes in child support law in colorado so treat them as estimates and also while they might work for simple cases unless you have the assistance of a colorado divorce or family law attorney you may miss a factor or miscalculate the totalswwwcourtsstatecous colorado child support calculator in ms excel format from the colorado supreme court very comprehensive and considers the common factors which impact child support in colorado child support credit when children staying with obligor in colorado the child support obligation is a fixed monthly amount constant throughout the year even when the children are staying with the obligor however colorado support law gives credit in the form of reduced child support to the obligor in situations involving shared physical custody defined as 93 overnights or more per year that means if one parent has 92 or fewer overnights heshe receives no credit for the time spent with the children the practical effect of this however is that a parent without primary residential responsibility who lives in another state is unlikely to reach 93 overnights and therefore receives no credit under the child support law in colorado for time spent with the children earmarking child support in colorado colorado family law judges will order one parent to pay child support to the other but does not give the obligor any ability to control how the money is spent fair or not colorado child support law simply presumes without the right to question that child support is spent on the children colorado state child support law also prohibits inkind support so the obligor cannot buy diapers toys or even give the children money directly and count it as support rather colorado family law courts treat such expenses as gifts to the children which parents are expected to do anyway transportation medical  other expenses unless the parents agree otherwise colorado child support law provides that the expenses of transporting the children from one parent to the other are allocated in accordance with their proportional incomes a good parenting plan will include not only this provision but will also address the physical burden ie who drives which half of the journey or who escorts the children on flights unreimbursed medical expenses should also be addressed child support law in colorado typically divides routine expenses copays infrequent medical assistance in accordance with the parties proportional incomes after the parent receiving support has paid the first 250 per child per calendar year if medical expenses are regular and recurring they may be considered extraordinary expenses and factored into the colorado child support worksheet finally in very limited circumstances a colorado divorce or family law court may order the payment of other expenses such as private education or extracurricular activities but these situations are rare  typically colorado courts cannot order payment for extracurricular expenses childrens vehicle expenses etc termination of child support in colorado the child support obligation in colorado is owing until the childs emancipation which is generally the earliest of the child turning 19 marrying joining the military or graduating from high school and becoming selfsufficient or death in rare cases child support may extend beyond the childs 19th birthday such as the child still being in high school or equivalent support continues until the month after graduation or the child being physically or mentally unable to support himself or herself in which case a court may continue support indefinitely for child support orders entered after july 1 1997 the support obligation terminates automatically once the last child reaches 19 absent court order to the contrary c r s 1410115 16 but be careful before trying to take advantage of automatic termination  it does not apply to these situations if child support arrears are still owing those arrears must still be paid if there is still another child for whom support is owing the original support obligation continues until modified by the court obligors should avoid the temptation to reduce the support without an order upon a childs emancipation  eg if one child emancipates and one remains the support owing is not reduced by half if a support order was entered before july 1 1997 the obligor must still file a motion and obtain a court order to terminate the obligation upon the last childs emancipation college expenses in colorado formerly colorado divorce and family law courts could order child support to continue while a child was in college and even order payment of college expenses after many legislative changes in the 1990s the end result is that a colorado court no longer has the authority to order payment towards college expenses unless the parents have voluntarily written such a provision into their parenting plan if the parents have a colorado decree adopted before july 1 1997 which requires college expenses to be paid that clause is no longer enforceable as written unless it was the result of the parties voluntary agreement however even if not enforceable as written the colorado divorce or family law court has discretion to order limited contributions towards college expenses just tuition books  fees but not room  board until the child is 21 this issue is experiencing an increase in litigation as children who were of preschool age when their parents divorced in the late 1980s through june 1997 are beginning to enter college enforcement of child support in colorado the obligee cannot link parenting time to receipt of child support or deny visitation to a deadbeat parent thus if the obligor is behind in payments other enforcement methods must be used in case of arrears and even modifications in some instances the obligee may wish to contact the local child support enforcement unit cseu for a nominal 25 fee far cheaper than hiring a private colorado child support lawyer the cseu child support lawyers will help pursue the obligor and enforce payment of both the arrears and current support the cseu has some enforcement measures not available to private attorneys such as revoking drivers licenses attaching tax returns or even revoking professional occupational licenses the downsides though are that the cseu can take a year or more to navigate through their bureaucracy and they do not collect interest on arrears an alternative which is likely quicker and has the additional benefit of collecting not only the arrears but the statutory 12 interest is to retain a private colorado child support attorney we can assist with some effective mechanisms such as contempt of court proceedings where the family law judge threatens to throw the obligor in jail unless heshe pays an income assignment or even putting a lien on the other partys residencebut the obligee should never expect immediate results  colorado domestic relations courts are swamped so individual cases take months to filter through the system colorado child support tax issues child support is not taxdeductible unlike maintenance unless the parties otherwise agree upon request the colorado child support law
