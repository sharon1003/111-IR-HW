admissions rate 33if you want to get in the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate this tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are the acceptance rate at ucsb is 33 for every 100 applicants 33 are admitted this means the school is very selective if you meet ucsbs requirements for gpa satact scores and other components of the application you have a great shot at getting in but if you fall short on gpa or your satact scores youll have a very low chance of being admitted even if you meet the other admissions requirements ucsb gpa requirements many schools specify a minimum gpa requirement but this is often just the bare minimum to submit an application without immediately getting rejected the gpa requirement that really matters is the gpa you need for a real chance of getting in for this we look at the schools average gpa for its current students average gpa 402the average gpa at ucsb is 402 most schools use a weighted gpa out of 40 though some report an unweighted gpa with a gpa of 402 ucsb requires you to be at the top of your class youll need nearly straight as in all your classes to compete with other applicants furthermore you should be taking hard classes  ap or ib courses  to show that collegelevel academics is a breeze if youre currently a junior or senior your gpa is hard to change in time for college applications if your gpa is at or below the school average of 402 youll need a higher sat or act score to compensate this will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher gpas than you sat and act requirements each school has different requirements for standardized testing most schools require the sat or act and many also require sat subject tests you must take either the sat or act to submit an application to ucsb more importantly you need to do well to have a strong application ucsb sat requirements many schools say they have no sat score cutoff but the truth is that there is a hidden sat requirement this is based on the schools average score average sat 1330 old 1874the average sat score composite at ucsb is a 1330 on the 1600 sat scale on the old 2400 sat this corresponds

testing strategy ucsb has the score choice policy of all scores this means that ucsb requires you to send all sat scores youve ever taken to their office this sounds daunting but most schools dont actually consider all your scores equally for example if you scored an 1300 on one test and a 1500 on another they wont actually average the two tests more commonly the school will take your highest score on a single test date even better some schools form a superscore  that is they take your highest section score across all your test dates and combine them some students are still worried about submitting too many test scores theyre afraid that ucsb will look down on too many attempts to raise your score but how many is too many from our research and talking to admissions officers weve learned that 46 tests is a safe number to submit the college understands that you want to have the best chance of admission and retaking the test is a good way to do this within a reasonable number of tests they honestly dont care how many times youve taken it theyll just focus on your score if you take it more than 6 times colleges start wondering why youre not improving with each test theyll question your study skills and ability to improve but below 6 tests we strongly encourage retaking the test to maximize your chances if your sat score is currently below a 1440 we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the sat and retaking it you dont have much to lose and you can potentially raise your score and significantly boost your chances of getting in exclusive want to learn

if you apply the strategies in this guide youll study smarter and make huge score improvements ucsb act requirements just like for the sat ucsb likely doesnt have a hard act cutoff but if you score too low your application will get tossed in the trash average act 27the average act score at ucsb is 27 this score makes ucsb moderately competitive for act scores the 25th percentile act score is 24 and the 75th percentile act score is 30 even though ucsb likely says they have no minimum act requirement if you apply with a 24 or below youll have a very hard time getting in unless you have something else very impressive in your application there are so many applicants scoring 27 and above that a 24 will look academically weak act score sending policy if youre taking the act as opposed to the sat you have a huge advantage in how you send scores and this dramatically affects your testing strategy here it is when you send act scores to colleges you have absolute control over which tests you send you could take 10 tests and only send your highest one this is unlike the sat where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken this means that you have more chances than you think to improve your act score to try to aim for the schools act requirement of 30 and above you should try to take the act as many times as you can when you have the final score that youre happy with you can then send only that score to all your schools act superscore policy by and large most colleges do not superscore the act superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit and then combines them into the best possible composite score thus most schools will just take your highest act score from a single sitting we werent able to find the schools exact act policy which most likely means that it does not superscore regardless you can choose your single best act score to send in to ucsb so you should prep until you reach our recommended target act score of 30 studying for the act instead want to learn how to improve your act score by 4 points download our free guide on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve

requirements both the sat and act have a writing section that includes an essay ucsb requires you to take the satact writing section theyll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration sat subject test requirements schools vary in their sat subject test requirements typically selective schools tend to require them while most schools in the country do not ucsb has indicated that sat subject tests are recommended typically this means that sat subject tests are not required but submitting them can showcase particular strengths for example if youre applying to an engineering school submitting science and math sat subject tests will boost your application typically your satact and gpa are far more heavily weighed than your sat subject tests if you have the choice between improving your satact score or your sat subject test scores definitely choose to improve your satact score
