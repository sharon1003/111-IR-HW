appropriations bill for the departments of labor health and human services and education contained the following limitations on federal spending for abortion that is typical of hyde amendment language generally title iprohibiting federally funded abortions sec 101 this bill makes permanent the prohibition on the use of federal funds including funds in the budget of the district of columbia for abortion or health coverage that includes abortion the prohibitions in this bill and current prohibitions do not apply to abortions in cases of rape or incest or where a physical condition endangers a

for qualified health plans regarding abortion coverage and charges for abortion coverage — httpswwwcongressgovbill115thcongresshousebill7background  editthe hyde amendment was introduced by prolife congressman henry j hyde and first passed by congress in 1977 three years after roe vs wade implementation of the initial amendment was blocked for almost a year by an injunction in the mc rae v matthews case during this case the reproductive freedom project the center for constitutional rights and planned parenthood collectively represented a pregnant medicaid recipient and health care providers who challenged the hyde amendment the united states supreme court vacated the injunction in august 1977 leading abortions financed by federal medicaid to drop from 300000 per year to a few thousand 4 other bans were modeled after the hyde amendment extending to other annual spending bills in the late 1970s and early 1980s this eventually led federal funds to be banned in federal worker health plans women in federal prisons women in the military peace corps volunteers and international family planning programs that use nonu s funds to perform or advocate for abortion 11the hyde amendment has been reenacted every year since 1976 but exceptions have varied for example the 1978 amendment presented new exceptions for rape survivors and incest cases 4 however in 1980 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the original hyde amendment language with a 54 vote in harris v mc rae the majority found that the hyde amendment did not violate the establishment clause under the first amendment or due processequal protection provided by the fifth amendment 12 this case decided the single exception for the amendment would be in cases where the womans life is endangered this decision was upheld from fiscal years 19811993 4 while the supreme court came close to reintroducing exceptions for cases of rape or incest in webster v reproductive health services of missouri president george h w bush succeeded in vetoing the bill despite an attempted house override 11 this decision left the amendment with the sole exception of concern being endangered life of the mother the language was not altered until the clinton administration in 1993 at this time the hyde amendment was once again expanded to include exceptions for rape and incest cases 12later in william v zbaraz 1980 the united states supreme court upheld that states could constitutionally make their own versions of the hyde amendment 4 and statesthe federal government have no statutory or constitutional obligation to fund medically necessary abortions 13currently 17 states extend abortion coverage to women enrolled in medicaid through their own budgets and 6 states extend abortion coverage when a womans health is at risk the remainder of the country abides by the hyde amendment south dakota expands on the hyde amendment and restricts funding even in cases of rape or incest 3 as of 1994 federal law mandates all states to pay for abortion cases involving rape or incest proving south dakotas actions to be problematic 4on january 24 2017 the house voted to make the hyde amendment h r 7 permanent in response speaker paul ryan rwi stated that we are a prolife congress and he reaffirmed the governments commitment to restricting tax money to funding abortions 14support for the amendment  editone of the primary arguments surrounding the hyde amendment is that of morality and the discussion as to whether or not taxpayer money should be used for abortion services there are many americans who believe that federal money should not be used to fund abortion practices which was one of the underlying reasons that the bill has had so much support from the start proponents of the amendment assert that the hyde amendment is an enforcement of religious liberty and conscience of prolife americans who do not wish to support either fiscally or morally the act of abortion 13another argument commonly made by supporters of the hyde amendment is that the amendment itself does not prevent women from seeking out an abortion because it does not criminalize abortions themselves but simply withholds government money from such programs supporters would claim that a womens lack of access to such services on the grounds of fiscal matters is the product not of governmental restrictions on access to abortions but rather of her indigency 15 simply put this means that supporters of the bill claim that the hyde amendment does not prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion but it prevents the entitlement of government funding to women who wish to have one advocates of the hyde amendment further state that this ban of federal funding for abortions does not interfere with a womans freedom to seek out an abortion since the amendment does not legally outlaw the medical service 15effects and implications of the hyde amendment  editthe hyde amendment restricts abortion coverage for federallyfunded healthcare recipients specifically women enrolled in medicare and medicaid native american women u s servicewomen and veterans women in peace corps female federal employees d c women residents and women in immigration detention facilities and prisons 16 the hyde amendment does not restrict women who receive healthcare through the u s government the option of paying for the procedure out of pocket critics argue the hyde amendment disproportionately affects lowincome women as an estimated 42 of abortion recipients live below the poverty line 17 since the passage of the hyde amendment more than one million women have not been able to afford abortions and so have had to carry unwanted pregnancies to term 18 19 however even with its passage an estimated 20 of abortions are paid through medicaid 20state actions  editstates that fund abortions state funds abortions voluntarily state funds abortions under court order currently fifteen states restrict coverage in accordance with the hyde amendment however despite widespread efforts to further restrict abortion coverage at the state level some states are striving to ensure coverage of abortion services in the face of funding bans 21 consequently the cutoff of federal medicaid funds prompted some states to provide public funding for abortion services from their own coffers over time the number of states doing so has gradually expanded either through legislation or consequent to judicial rulings mandating equal access to health care for lowincome women 22there are currently 17 states who use their own state funds to provide medically necessary abortions and similar services these states include alaska arizona california connecticut hawaii illinois maryland massachusetts minnesota montana new jersey new mexico new york oregon vermont washington and west virginia 23specific stipulations have been put in place by some state governments some of these provisions remove restrictions that have been put in place at the federal level while others are used to further extend the reach that hyde amendment has put into place for example in iowa in order to receive an abortion under the medicaid program approval must be given from the governor 23 in iowa mississippi and virginia a provision has been made for the case of fetal impairment 23recent discourse  editthe 2016 platform marked the first time the democratic platform had an explicit call to repeal the hyde amendment 9 the platform stateswe believe unequivocally like the majority of americans that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services including safe and legal abortion—regardless of where she lives how much money she makes or how she is insured we believe that reproductive health is core to women’s men’s and young people’s health and well being we will continue to stand up to republican efforts to defund planned parenthood health centers which provide critical health services to millions of people we will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion including by repealing the hyde amendment 24hillary clinton advocated for a repeal of the hyde amendment throughout her 2016 presidential campaign she was quoted as saying “any right that requires you to take extraordinary measures to access it is no right at all” at a campaign rally in new hampshire 25 the democratic vice presidential candidate tim kaine reportedly stood with his running mate on the issue despite formerly having been a supporter of the hyde amendment 26however despite the efforts of hillary clinton and the democratic party recent actions have given roots to the amendment much of the current discourse concerning the hyde amendment stems from the recent passage of the h r 7 no taxpayer funding for abortion and abortion insurance full disclosure act of 2017 the legislation was passed by the house of representatives and if passed by the senate as well as signed by the president would give substantial support for the validity of the hyde amendment as permanent law 27 in particular supporters of the legislation claim that it saves lives and protects the conscience of taxpayers opposed to abortion however opponents argue that it discriminates against lowincome women by denying them access to medical procedure 27in 2018 republicans proposed adding the hyde amendment to the affordable care act in the 2018 spending bill in exchange for increased funding to reduce insurance premiums and adding reinsurance however this was rejected by democrats 28 speaker paul ryan had said that he would not bring measures to the floor on reducing aca premiums without adding the hyde amendment language 29related laws  editthe stupak–pitts amendment an amendment to the affordable health care for america act was introduced by democratic rep bart stupak of michigan it prohibits use of federal funds to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion except in cases of rape incest or danger to the life of the mother 30 and was included in the bill as passed by the house of representatives on november 7 2009 however the senate bill passed by the house on march 21 2010 did not contain that hyde amendment language as part of an agreement between rep stupak and president obama to secure stupaks vote the president issued executive order 13535 on march 24 2010 affirming that the hyde amendment would extend to the new
