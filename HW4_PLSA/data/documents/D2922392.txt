necessarily as easy as you think when you signed up for your 401k plan you were asked to choose a beneficiary  someone who would receive the account money in case you should die this may seem like a nobrainer especially if you are married but its not that simple for everybody there are certain things you need to keep in mind especially if you are separated or single or if you are thinking of naming your minor children as beneficiaries if you are married if you are married federal law says your spouse is automatically the beneficiary of your 401k or other pension plan period you should still fill out the beneficiary form with your spouses name for the record if you want to name a beneficiary who is someone other than your spouse your spouse must sign a waiver the waiver must be in writing for example you might be separated from your spouse  not divorced  and want to name a new beneficiary even if your intended beneficiary is a domestic partner youve been with for 20 years your spouse will have legal claim to your 401k if you die unless he or she signs a waiver if you are single if you are single when you die your account will go to whomever you named as a beneficiary if you have not named anyone the account will go to your estate single parents take note you may have named your child or children as beneficiaries for your 401k plan you may want to keep this arrangement

money  and that could take some time you might want to think about choosing a trustee person or institution now and naming your childrens trust as your beneficiary this way the money can be transferred and invested with less delay even if your children are no longer minors you still might have concerns about their ability to manage a large sum of money in this case you might want to consider setting up trust in their name and making the trust the beneficiary rather than permitting a direct transfer to your children be sure to consult with a tax advisor before naming a trust as a
