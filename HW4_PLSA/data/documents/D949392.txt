also known as idris shah né sayed idries el hashimi arabic سيد إدريس هاشمي and by the pen name arkon daraul was an author and teacher in the sufi tradition who wrote over three dozen books on topics ranging from psychology and spirituality to travelogues and culture studies born in india the descendant of a family of afghan nobles shah grew up mainly in england his early writings centred on magic and witchcraft in 1960 he established a publishing house octagon press producing translations of sufi classics as well as titles of his own his seminal work was the sufis which appeared in 1964 and was well received internationally in 1965 shah founded the institute for cultural research a londonbased educational charity devoted to the study of human behaviour and culture a similar organisation the institute for the study of human knowledge ishk exists in the united states under the directorship of stanford university psychology professor robert ornstein whom shah appointed as his deputy in the u s in his writings shah presented sufism as a universal form of wisdom that predated islam emphasizing that sufism was not static but always adapted itself to the current time place and people he framed his teaching in western psychological terms shah made extensive use of traditional teaching stories and parables texts that contained multiple layers of meaning designed to trigger insight and selfreflection in the reader he is perhaps best known for his collections of humorous mulla nasrudin stories shah was at times criticized by orientalists who questioned his credentials and background his role in the controversy surrounding a new translation of the rubaiyat of omar khayyam published by his friend robert graves and his older brother omar alishah came in for particular scrutiny however he also had many notable defenders chief among them the novelist doris lessing shah came to be recognized as a spokesman for sufism in the west and lectured as a visiting professor at a number of western universities his works have played a significant part in presenting sufism as a form of spiritual wisdom approachable by individuals and not necessarily attached to any specific religion

editidries shah was born in simla india to an afghan  indian father sirdar ikbal ali shah a writer and diplomat and a scottish mother saira elizabeth luiza shah his family on the paternal side were musavi sayyids their ancestral home was near the paghman gardens of kabul 3 his paternal grandfather sayed amjad ali shah was the nawab of sardhana in the northindian state of uttar pradesh 4 an hereditary title the family had gained thanks to the services an earlier ancestor janfishan khan had rendered to the british 5 6shah mainly grew up in the vicinity of london 7 according to l f rushbrook williams shah began accompanying his father in his travels from a very young age and although they both travelled widely and often they always returned to england where the family made their home for many years through these travels which were often part of ikbal ali shahs sufi work shah was able to meet and spend time with prominent statesmen and distinguished personalities in both east and west williams writessuch an upbringing presented to a young man of marked intelligence such as idries shah soon proved himself to possess many opportunities to acquire a truly international outlook a broad vision and an acquaintance with people and places that any professional diplomat of more advanced age and longer experience might well envy but a career of diplomacy did not attract idries shah 8shah described his own unconventional upbringing in a 1971 bbc interview with pat williams he described how his father and his extended family and friends always tried to expose the children to a multiplicity of impacts and a wide range of contacts and experiences with the intention of producing a wellrounded person shah described this as the sufi approach to education 9after his family moved from london to oxford in 1940 to escape the blitz german bombing he spent two or three years at the city of oxford high school for boys 6 in 1945 he accompanied his father to uruguay as secretary to his fathers halal meat mission he returned to england in october 1946 following allegations of improper business dealings 6 7personal life  editshah married the parsi cynthia kashfi kabraji in 1958 they had a daughter saira in 1964 followed by twins – a son tahir and another daughter safia – in 1966 10friendship with gerald gardner and robert graves and publication of the sufis  edittowards the end of the 1950s shah established contact with wiccan circles in london and then acted as a secretary and companion to gerald gardner the founder of modern wicca for some time 6 11 in those days shah used to hold court for anyone interested in sufism at a table in the cosmo restaurant in swiss cottage north london every tuesday evening 12in 1960 shah founded his publishing house octagon press one of its first titles was gardners biography – titled gerald gardner witch the book was attributed to one of gardners followers jack l bracelin but had in fact been written by shah 11 13according to wiccan frederic lamond bracelins name was used because shah did not want to confuse his sufi students by being seen to take an interest in another esoteric tradition 12 lamond said that shah seemed to have become somewhat disillusioned with gardner and had told him one day when he was visiting for tea when i was interviewing gerald i sometimes wished i was a news of the world reporter what marvellous material for an exposé and yet i have it on good authority that this group will be the cornerstone of the religion of the coming age but rationally rationally i cant see it 12in january 1961 while on a trip to mallorca with gardner shah met the english poet robert graves 14 shah wrote to graves from his pension in palma requesting an opportunity of saluting you one day before very long 14 he added that he was currently researching ecstatic religions and that he had been attending experiments conducted by the witches in britain into mushroomeating and so on – a topic that had been of interest to graves for some time 14 15shah also told graves that he was intensely preoccupied at the moment with the carrying forward of ecstatic and intuitive knowledge 15 graves and shah soon became close friends and confidants 14 graves took a supportive interest in shahs writing career and encouraged him to publish an authoritative treatment of sufism for a western readership along with the practical means for its study this was to become the sufis shah managed to obtain a substantial advance on the book resolving temporary financial difficulties 14in 1964 the sufis appeared 7 published by doubleday with a long introduction by robert graves 16 the book chronicles the impact of sufism on the development of western civilisation and traditions from the seventh century onward through the work of such figures as roger bacon john of the cross raymond lully chaucer and others and has become a classic 17 like shahs other books on the topic the sufis was conspicuous for avoiding terminology that might have identified his interpretation of sufism with traditional islam 18the book also employed a deliberately scattered style shah wrote to graves that its aim was to decondition people and prevent their reconditioning had it been otherwise he might have used a more conventional form of exposition the book sold poorly at first and shah invested a considerable amount of his own money in advertising it 19 graves told him not to worry even though he had some misgivings about the writing and was hurt that shah had not allowed him to proofread it before publication he said he was so proud in having assisted in its publication and assured shah that it was a marvellous book and will be recognised as such before long leave it to find its own readers who will hear your voice spreading not those envisaged by doubleday 20john g bennett and the gurdjieff connection  editin june 1962 a couple of years prior to the publication of the sufis shah had also established contact with members of the movement that had formed around the mystical teachings of gurdjieff and ouspensky 21 22 a press article had appeared nb 1 describing the authors visit to a secret monastery in central asia where methods strikingly similar to gurdjieffs methods were apparently being taught 22 the otherwise unattested monastery had it was implied a representative in england 6one of ouspenskys earliest pupils reggie hoare who had been part of the gurdjieff work since 1924 made contact with shah through that article hoare attached special significance to what shah had told him about the enneagram symbol and said that shah had revealed secrets about it that went far beyond what we had heard from ouspensky 23 through hoare shah was introduced to other gurdjieffians including john g bennett a noted gurdjieff student and founder of an institute for the comparative study of history philosophy and the sciences located at coombe springs a 7acre 28hectare estate in kingston upon thames surrey 23at that time bennett had already investigated the sufi origins of many of gurdjieffs teachings based on both gurdjieffs own numerous statements and on travels bennett himself made in the east where he met various sufi sheikhs 24 he was convinced that gurdjieff had adopted many of the ideas and techniques of the sufis and that for those who heard gurdjieffs lectures in the early 1920s the sufi origin of his teaching was unmistakable to anyone who had studied both 25bennett wrote about his first meeting with shah in his autobiography witness 1974 at first i was wary i had just decided to go forward on my own and now another teacher had appeared one or two conversations with reggie convinced me that i ought at least to see for myself elizabeth and i went to dinner with the hoares to meet shah who turned out to be a young man in his early 40s he spoke impeccable english and but for his beard and some of his gestures might well have been taken for an english public school type our first impressions were unfavourable he was restless smoked incessantly and seemed too intent on making a good impression halfway through the evening our attitude completely changed we recognized that he was not only an unusually gifted man but that he had the indefinable something that marks the man who has worked seriously upon himself knowing reggie to be a very cautious man trained moreover in assessing information by many years in the intelligence service i accepted his assurances and also his belief that shah had a very important mission in the west that we ought to help him to accomplish 23shah gave bennett a declaration of the people of the tradition 26 and authorised him to share this with other gurdjieffians 22 the document announced that there was now an opportunity for the transmission of a secret hidden special superior form of knowledge combined with the personal impression bennett formed of shah it convinced bennett that shah was a genuine emissary of the  sarmoung monastery in afghanistan an inner circle of sufis whose teachings had inspired gurdjieff 22 27whose beard nasruddin dreamt that he had satans beard in his hand tugging the hair he cried the pain you feel is nothing compared to that which you inflict on the mortals you lead astray and he gave the beard such a tug that he woke up yelling in agony only then did he realise that the beard he held in his hand was his own− idries shah 28for the next few years bennett and shah had weekly private talks that lasted for hours later shah also gave talks to the students at coombe springs bennett says that shahs plans included reaching people who occupied positions of authority and power who were already halfconsciously aware that the problems of mankind could no longer be solved by economic political or social action such people were touched he said by the new forces moving in the world to help mankind to survive the coming crisis 23bennett agreed with these ideas and also agreed that people attracted by overtly spiritual or esoteric movements seldom possessed the qualities needed to reach and occupy positions of authority and that there were sufficient grounds for believing that throughout the world there were already people occupying important positions who were capable of looking beyond the limitations of nationality and cultures and who could see for themselves that the only hope for mankind lies in the intervention of a higher source 23bennett wrote i had seen enough of shah to know that he was no charlatan or idle boaster and that he was intensely serious about the task he had been given 23 wishing to support shahs work bennett decided in 1965 after agonising for a long time and discussing the matter with the council and members of his institute to give the coombe springs property to shah who had insisted that any such gift must be made with no strings attached 6 22 once the property was transferred to shah he banned bennetts associates from visiting and made bennett himself feel unwelcome 22bennett says he did receive an invitation to the midsummer revels a party shah held at coombe springs that lasted two days and two nights primarily for the young people whom shah was then attracting 23 anthony blake who worked with bennett for 15 years says when idries shah acquired coombe springs his main activity was giving parties i had only a few encounters with him but much enjoyed his irreverent attitude bennett once said to me there are different styles in the work mine is like gurdjieffs around struggle with ones denial but shahs way is to treat the work as a joke 29after a few months shah sold the plot – worth more than £100000 – to a developer and used the proceeds to establish himself and his work activities at langton house in langton green near tunbridge wells a 50acre estate that once belonged to the family of lord badenpowell founder of the boy scouts 6 30along with the coombe springs property bennett also handed the care of his body of pupils to shah comprising some 300 people 22 shah promised he would integrate all those who were suitable about half of their number found a place in shahs work 22 some 20 years later the gurdjieffian author james moore suggested that bennett had been duped by shah 6 bennett gave an account of the matter himself in his autobiography 1974 he said that shahs behaviour after the transfer of the property was hard to bear but also insisted that shah was a man of exquisite manners and delicate sensibilities and considered that shah might have adopted his behaviour deliberately to make sure that all bonds with coombe springs were severed 22 he added that langton green was a far more suitable place for shahs work than coombe springs could have been and said he felt no sadness that coombe springs lost its identity he concluded his account of the matter by stating that he had gained freedom through his contact with shah and had learned to love people whom he could not understand 31according to bennett shah later also engaged in discussions with the heads of the gurdjieff groups in new york in a letter to paul anderson from 5 march 1968 bennett wrote madame de salzmann and all the others are aware of their own limitations and do no more than they are able to do while i was in new york elizabeth and i visited the foundation and we saw most of the leading people in the new york group as well as jeanne de salzmann herself something is preparing but whether it will come to fruition i cannot tell i refer to their connection with idries shah and his capacity for turning everything upside down it is useless with such people to be passive and it is useless to avoid the issue for the time being we can only hope that some good will come and meanwhile continue our own work 32the author and clinical psychologist kathleen speeth later wrotewitnessing the growing conservatism within the gurdjieff foundation john bennett hoped new blood and leadership would come from elsewhere although there may have been flirtation with shah nothing came of it the prevailing sense among the leaders of the gurdjieff work that nothing must change that a treasure in their safekeeping must at all costs be preserved in its original form was stronger than any wish for a new wave of inspiration 32sufi studies and institutes  editin 1965 shah founded the society for understanding fundamental ideas sufi later renamed the institute for cultural research icr – an educational charity aimed at stimulating study debate education and research into all aspects of human thought behaviour and culture 16 33 34 35 he also established the society for sufi studies sss 36langton house at langton green became a place of gathering and discussion for poets philosophers and statesmen from around the world and an established part of the literary scene of the time 37 the icr held meetings and gave lectures there awarding fellowships to international scholars including sir john glubb aquila berlas kiani richard gregory and robert cecil the head of european studies at the university of reading who became chairman of the institute in the early 1970s 37 38shah was an early member and supporter of the club of rome nb 2 and several presentations were given to the institute by scientists like alexander king 39 40 41other visitors pupils and wouldbe pupils included the poet ted hughes novelists j d salinger alan sillitoe and doris lessing zoologist desmond morris and psychologist robert ornstein the interior of the house was decorated in a middleeastern fashion and buffet lunches were held every sunday for guests in a large dining room that was once the estate stable nicknamed the elephant a reference to the eastern tale of the  elephant in the dark  30over the following years shah developed octagon press as a means of publishing and distributing reprints of translations of numerous sufi classics 42 in addition he collected translated and wrote thousands of sufi tales making these available to a western audience through his books and lectures 36 several of shahs books feature the mullah nasruddin character sometimes with illustrations provided by richard williams in shahs interpretation the mulla nasruddin stories previously considered a folkloric part of muslim cultures were presented as sufi parables 43nasruddin was featured in shahs television documentary dreamwalkers which aired on the bbc in 1970 segments included richard williams being interviewed about his unfinished animated film about nasruddin and scientist john kermisch discussing the use of nasruddin stories at the rand corporation think tank other guests included the british psychiatrist william sargant discussing the hampering effects of brainwashing and social conditioning on creativity and problemsolving and the comedian marty feldman talking with shah about the role of humour and ritual in human life the program ended with shah asserting that humanity could further its own evolution by breaking psychological limitations but that there was a constant accretion of pessimism which effectively prevents evolution in this form from going ahead man is asleep – must he die before he wakes up 44shah also organised sufi study groups in the united states claudio naranjo a chilean psychiatrist who was teaching in california in the late 1960s says that after being disappointed in the extent to which gurdjieffs school entailed a living lineage he had turned towards sufism and had become part of a group under the guidance of idries shah 45 naranjo cowrote a book with robert ornstein entitled on the psychology of meditation 1971 both of them were associated with the university of california where ornstein was a research psychologist at the langley porter psychiatric institute 46ornstein was also president and founder of the institute for the study of human knowledge established in 1969 seeing a need in the u s for books and collections on ancient and new ways of thinking he formed the ishk book service in 1972 as a central source for important contemporary and traditional literature becoming the sole u s distributor of the works of idries shah published by octagon press 47another shah associate the scientist and professor leonard lewin who was teaching telecommunications at the university of colorado at the time set up sufi study groups and other enterprises for the promotion of sufi ideas like the institute for research on the dissemination of human knowledge irdhk and also edited an anthology of writings by and about shah entitled the diffusion of sufi ideas in the west 1972 48 49later years  editshah wrote around two dozen more books over the following decades many of them drawing on classical sufi sources 6 achieving a huge worldwide circulation 33 his writings appealed primarily to an intellectually oriented western audience 18 by translating sufi teachings into contemporary psychological language he presented them in vernacular and hence accessible terms 50 his folktales illustrating sufi wisdom through anecdote and example proved particularly popular 18 33 shah received and accepted invitations to lecture as a visiting professor at academic institutions including the university of california the university of geneva the national university of la plata and various english universities 51 besides his literary and educational work he found time to design an air ioniser forming a company together with coppy laws and run a number of textile ceramics and electronics companies 30 he also undertook several journeys to his ancestral afghanistan and involved himself in setting up relief efforts there he drew on these experiences later on in his book kara kush a novel about the soviet war in afghanistan 16illness  editin late spring of 1987 about a year after his final visit to afghanistan shah suffered two successive and massive heart attacks 35 52 he was told that he had only eight per cent of his heart function left and could not expect to survive 35 despite intermittent bouts of illness he continued working and produced further books over the next nine years 35 52death  editthe grave of idries shah in brookwood cemetery idries shah died in london on 23 november 1996 at the age of 72 and was buried in brookwood cemetery according to his obituary in the daily telegraph idries shah was a collaborator with mujahideen in the soviet war in afghanistan a director of studies for the institute for cultural research and a governor of the royal humane society and the royal hospital and home for incurables 35 he was also a member of the athenaeum club 6 at the time of his death shahs books had sold over 15 million copies in a dozen languages worldwide 7 and had been reviewed in numerous international journals and newspapers 53 54teachings  editbooks on magic and the occult  editshahs early books were studies of what he called minority beliefs his first book oriental magic published in 1956 was originally intended to be titled considerations in eastern and african minority beliefs he followed this in 1957 with the secret lore of magic book of the sorcerers originally entitled some materials on european minoritybelief literature the names of these books were according to a contributor to a 1973 festschrift for shah changed before publication due to the exigencies of commercial publishing practices 55before his death in 1969 shahs father asserted that the reason why he and his son had published books on the subject of magic and the occult was to forestall a probable popular revival or belief among a significant number of people in this nonsense my son eventually completed this task when he researched for several years and published two important books on the subject 56in an interview in psychology today from 1975 shah elaborated the main purpose of my books on magic was to make this material available to the general reader for too long people believed that there were secret books hidden places and amazing things they held onto this information as something to frighten themselves with so the first purpose was information this is the magic of east and west thats all there is no more the second purpose of those books was to show that there do seem to be forces some of which are either rationalized by this magic or may be developed from it which do not come within customary physics or within the experience of ordinary people i think this should be studied that we should gather the data and analyze the phenomena we need to separate the chemistry of magic from the alchemy as it were 57shah went on to say that his books on the subject were not written for the current devotees of magic and witchcraft and that in fact he subsequently had to avoid them as they would only be disappointed in what he had to say 57these books were followed by the publication of the travelogue destination mecca 1957 which was featured on television by sir david attenborough 58 both destination mecca and oriental magic contain sections on the subject of sufism 59 60sufism as a form of timeless wisdom  editshah presented sufism as a form of timeless wisdom that predated islam 61 he emphasised that the nature of sufism was alive not static and that it always adapted its visible manifestations to new times places and people sufi schools are like waves which break upon rocks they are from the same sea in different forms for the same purpose he wrote quoting ahmad albadawi 36 61shah was often dismissive of orientalists descriptions of sufism holding that academic or personal study of its historical forms and methods was not a sufficient basis for gaining a correct understanding of it 61 in fact an obsession with its traditional forms might actually become an obstacle show a man too many camels bones or show them to him too often and he will not be able to recognise a camel when he comes across a live one is how he expressed this idea in one of his books 61 62shah like inayat khan presented sufism as a path that transcended individual religions and adapted it to a western audience 42 unlike khan however he deemphasised religious or spiritual trappings and portrayed sufism as a psychological technology a method or science that could be used to achieve selfrealisation 42 63 in doing so his approach seemed to be especially addressed to followers of gurdjieff students of the human potential movement and intellectuals acquainted with modern psychology 42 for example he wrote sufism  states that man may become objective and that objectivity enables the individual to grasp higher facts man is therefore invited to push his evolution ahead towards what is sometimes called in sufism real intellect 42 shah taught that the human being could acquire new subtle sense organs in response to need 36sufis believe that expressed in one way humanity is evolving towards a certain destiny we are all taking part in that evolution organs come into being as a result of the need for specific organs  rumi  the human beings organism is producing a new complex of organs in response to such a need in this age of transcending of time and space the complex of organs is concerned with the transcending of time and space what ordinary people regard as sporadic and occasional outbursts of telepathic or prophetic power are seen by the sufi as nothing less than the first stirrings of these same organs the difference between all evolution up to date and the present need for evolution is that for the past ten thousand years or so we have been given the possibility of a conscious evolution so essential is this more rarefied evolution that our future depends upon it— idries shah the sufis 64shah dismissed other eastern and western projections of sufism as watered down generalised or partial he included in this not only khans version but also the overtly muslim forms of sufism found in most islamic countries on the other hand the writings of shahs associates implied that he was the grand sheikh of the sufis – a position of authority undercut by the failure of any other sufis to acknowledge its existence 42 shah felt the best way to introduce sufi wisdom in the west while at the same time overcoming the problems of gurus and cults was to clarify the difference between a cult and an educational system and to contribute to knowledge in an interview he explained you must work within an educational pattern – not in the mumbojumbo area 65 as part of this approach he acted as director of studies at the icr 65 he also lectured on the study of sufism in the west at the university of sussex in 1966 this was later published as a monograph entitled special problems in the study of sufi ideas 66shah later explained that sufi activities were divided into different components or departments studies in sufism studies of sufism and studies for sufism 67studies for sufism helped lead people towards sufism and included the promotion of knowledge which might be lacking in the culture and needed to be restored and spread such as an understanding of social conditioning and brainwashing the difference between the rational and intuitive modes of thought and other activities so that peoples minds could become more free and wideranging studies of sufism included institutions and activities such as lectures and seminars which provided information about sufism and acted as a cultural liaison between the sufis and the public finally studies in sufism referred to being in a sufi school carrying out those activities prescribed by the teacher as part of a training and this could take many forms which did not necessarily fit into the preconceived notion of a mystical school 67shahs sufi aims and methodologies were also delineated in the declaration of the people of the tradition given at coombe springs in addition to making this announcement to feeding into certain fields of thought certain ideas and pointing out some of the factors surrounding this work the projectors of this declaration have a practical task this task is to locate individuals who have the capacity for obtaining the special knowledge of man which is available to group them in a special not haphazard manner so that each such group forms a harmonious organism to do this in the right place at the right time to provide an external and interior format with which to work as well as a formulation of ideas suitable to local conditions to balance theory with practice 23in a bbc interview from 1971 shah explained his contemporary adaptive approach i am interested in making available in the west those aspects of sufism which shall be of use to the west at this time i dont want to turn good europeans into poor asiatics people have asked me why i dont use traditional methods of spiritual training for instance in dealing with people who seek me out or hunt me down and of course the answer is that its for the same reason that you came to my house today in a motorcar and not on the back of a camel sufism is in fact not a mystical system not a religion but a body of knowledge 68shah frequently characterised some of his work as really only preliminary to actual sufi study in the same way that learning to read and write might be seen as preliminary to a study of literature unless the psychology is correctly oriented there is no spirituality though there can be obsession and emotionality often mistaken for it 69 70 anyone trying to graft spiritual practices upon an unregenerate personality  will end up with an aberration he argued 69 for this reason most of the work he produced from the sufis onwards was psychological in nature focused on attacking the nafsiammara the false self i have nothing to give you except the way to understand how to seek – but you think you can already do that 69shah was frequently criticised for not mentioning god very much in his writings his reply was that given mans present state there would not be much point in talking about god he illustrated the problem in a parable in his book thinkers of the east finding i could speak the language of ants i approached one and inquired what is god like does he resemble the ant he answered god no indeed – we have only a single sting but god he has two  69 71teaching stories  editfurther information teaching stories shah used teaching stories and humour to great effect in his work 61 72 shah emphasised the therapeutic function of surprising anecdotes and the fresh perspectives these tales revealed 73 the reading and discussion of such tales in a group setting became a significant part of the activities in which the members of shahs study circles engaged 43 the transformative way in which these puzzling or surprising tales could destabilise the students normal and unaware mode of consciousness was studied by stanford university psychology professor robert ornstein who along with fellow psychologist charles tart 74 and eminent writers such as poet laureate ted hughes 75 and nobelprize winning novelist doris lessing 36 76 was one of several notable thinkers profoundly influenced by shah 73 77shah and ornstein met in the 1960s 77 realising that ornstein could be an ideal partner in propagating his teachings translating them into the idiom of psychotherapy shah made him his deputy  khalifa in the united states 73 77 ornsteins the psychology of consciousness 1972 was enthusiastically received by the academic psychology community as it coincided with new interests in the field such as the study of biofeedback and other techniques designed to achieve shifts in mood and awareness ornstein has published more books in the field over the years 77philosopher of science and physicist henri bortoft used teaching tales from shahs corpus as analogies of the habits of mind which prevented people from grasping the scientific method of johann wolfgang von goethe bortofts the wholeness of nature goethes way of science includes tales from tales of the dervishes the exploits of the incomparable mullah nasruddin and a perfumed scorpion 78in their original historical and cultural setting sufi teaching stories of the kind popularised by shah – first told orally and later written down for the purpose of transmitting sufi faith and practice to successive generations – were considered suitable for people of all ages including children as they contained multiple layers of meaning 36 shah likened the sufi story to a peach a person may be emotionally stirred by the exterior as if the peach were lent to you you can eat the peach and taste a further delight  you can throw away the stone – or crack it and find a delicious kernel within this is the hidden depth 36 it was in this manner that shah invited his audience to receive the sufi story 36 by failing to uncover the kernel and regarding the story as merely amusing or superficial a person would accomplish nothing more than looking at the peach while others internalised the tale and allowed themselves to be touched by it 36tahir shah mentions his fathers storytelling at several points throughout his 2008 book in arabian nights first to discuss how idries shah made use of teaching stories my father never told us how the stories worked he did not reveal the layers the nuggets of information the fragments of truth and fantasy he didnt need to – because given the right conditions the stories activated sowing themselves 79 he then explains how his father used these stories to impart wisdom my father always had a tale at hand to divert our attention or to use as a way of transmitting an idea or a thought he used to say that the great collections of stories from the east were like encyclopedias storehouses of wisdom and knowledge ready to be studied to be appreciated and cherished to him stories represented much more than mere entertainment he saw them as complex psychological documents forming a body of knowledge that had been collected and refined since the dawn of humanity and more often than not passed down by word of mouth 79later on in the book he continues his discussion of stories as teaching tools quoting the following explanation his father gave him at the end of a story these stories are technical documents they are like maps or kind of blueprints what i do is show people how to use the maps because they have forgotten you may think its a strange way to teach – with stories – but long ago this was the way people passed on wisdom everyone knew how to take the wisdom from the story they could see through the layers in the same way you see a fish frozen in a block of ice but the world where we are living has lost this skill a skill they certainly once had they hear the stories and they like them because the stories amuse them make them feel warm but they cant see past the first layer into the ice the stories are like a lovely chessboard we all know how to play chess and we can be drawn into a game so complicated that our faculties are drained but imagine if the game was lost from a society for centuries and then the fine chessboard and its pieces were found everyone would cluster round to see them and praise them they might never imagine that such a fine object ever had a purpose other than to entertain the eyes the stories inner value has been lost in the same way at one time everyone knew how to play with them how to decipher them but now the rules have been forgotten it is for us to show people again how the game is played— tahir shah in arabian nights 79olav hammer in sufism in europe and north america 2004 cites an example of such a story 7 it tells of a man who is looking for his key on the ground 7 when a passing neighbour asks the man whether this is in fact the place where he lost the key the man replies no i lost it at home but there is more light here than in my own house 7 versions of this story have been known for many years in the west see streetlight effect  this is an example of the longnoted phenomenon of similar tales existing in many different cultures which was a central idea in shahs folktale collection world tales peter wilson writing in new trends and developments in the world of islam 1998 quotes another such story featuring a dervish who is asked to describe the qualities of his teacher alim 80 the dervish explains that alim wrote beautiful poetry and inspired him with his selfsacrifice and his service to his fellow man 80 his questioner readily approves of these qualities only to find the dervish rebuking him those are the qualities which would have recommended alim to you  80 81 then he proceeds to list the qualities which actually enabled alim to be an effective teacher hazrat alim azimi made me irritated which caused me to examine my irritation to trace its source alim azimi made me angry so that i could feel and transform my anger 81 he explains that alim azimi followed the path of blame intentionally provoking vicious attacks upon himself in order to bring the failings of both his students and critics to light allowing them to be seen for what they really were he showed us the strange so that the strange became commonplace and we could realise what it really is 80 81views on culture and practical life  editshahs concern was to reveal essentials underlying all cultures and the hidden factors determining individual behaviour 33 he discounted the western focus on appearances and superficialities which often reflected mere fashion and habit and drew attention to the origins of culture and the unconscious and mixed motivations of people and the groups formed by them he pointed out how both on the individual and group levels shortterm disasters often turn into blessings – and vice versa – and yet the knowledge of this has done little to affect the way people respond to events as they occur 33shah did not advocate the abandonment of worldly duties instead he argued that the treasure sought by the wouldbe disciple should derive from ones struggles in everyday living he considered practical work the means through which a seeker could do selfwork in line with the traditional adoption by sufis of ordinary professions through which they earned their livelihoods and worked on themselves 36shahs status as a teacher remained indefinable disclaiming both the guru identity and any desire to found a cult or sect he also rejected the academic hat 33 michael rubinstein writing in makers of modern culture concluded that he is perhaps best seen as an embodiment of the tradition in which the contemplative and intuitive aspects of the mind are regarded as being most productive when working together 33legacy  editidries shah considered his books his legacy in themselves they would fulfil the function he had fulfilled when he could no longer be there 82 promoting and distributing their teachers publications has been an important activity or work for shahs students both for fundraising purposes and for transforming public awareness 43 the icr suspended its activities in 2013 following the formation of a new charity the idries shah foundation 83 while the sss had ceased its activities earlier the ishk institute for the study of human knowledge headed by ornstein 84 is active in the united states after the 911 terrorist attacks for example it sent out a brochure advertising afghanistanrelated books authored by shah and his circle to members of the middle east studies association thus linking these publications to the need for improved crosscultural understanding 43when elizabeth hall interviewed shah for psychology today in july 1975 she asked him for the sake of humanity what would you like to see happen shah replied what i would really want in case anybody is listening is for the products of the last 50 years of psychological research to be studied by the public by everybody so that the findings become part of their way of thinking  they have this great body of psychological information and refuse to use it 57shahs brother omar alishah 1922–2005 was also a writer and teacher of sufism the brothers taught students together for a while in the 1960s but in 1977 agreed to disagree and went their separate ways 85 following idries shahs death in 1996 a fair number of his students became affiliated with omar alishahs movement 86one of shahs daughters saira shah became notable in 2001 for reporting on womens rights in afghanistan in her documentary beneath the veil 10 his son tahir shah is a noted travel writer journalist and adventurer reception  editshahs books on sufism achieved considerable critical acclaim he was the subject of a bbc documentary one pair of eyes in 1969 87 and two of his works  the way of the sufi and reflections were chosen as outstanding book of the year by the bbc s the critics programme 88 among other honours shah won six first prizes at the unesco world book year in 1973 87 and the islamic scholar james kritzeck commenting on shahs tales of the dervishes said that it was beautifully translated 88a collection of positive assessments of shahs work entitled sufi studies east and west was published in 1973 which included among others contributions from l f rushbrook williams rom landau mohammad hidayatullah gyula germanus sir john glubb sir razik fareed ishtiaq hussain qureshi ahmet emin yalman mahmoud youssef shawarbi and nasrollah s fatemi 89colin wilson stated that partly through idries shah i have begun to see some rather new and interesting implications about the subject of mysticism 90 and in his review of the magic monastery 1972 noted that shah is not primarily concerned with propagating some secret doctrine he is concerned with the method by which mystical knowledge is transmitted the sufis transmit knowledge through direct intuition rather in the manner of the zen masters and one of the chief means of doing this is by means of brief stories and parables which work their way into the subconscious and activate its hidden forces 91in afghanistan the kabul times said that caravan of dreams 1968 was highly recommended and of especial interest to afghans because it is basically an anthology of short stories tales and proverbs jokes and extracts from the written and oral literature which forms a part of many an evenings talk and interchange – even in these modern times – in afghanistan 92 the afghanistan news reported that the sufis covers important afghan contributions to world philosophy and science and was the first fullyauthoritative book on sufism and the human development system of the dervishes 93 as far as doubts about shahs background and credentials are concerned the sardar haji faiz muhammad khan zikeria an afghan scholar who had served as afghan minister of education and later ambassador and foreign minister of afghanistan issued a notarized declaration for the scholars of the world about the shah family in 1970 the musavi saiyids of afghanistan and khans of paghman are recognized as the descendants of the prophet – may peace be upon him they are recognized to be of the most noble descent of islam and are respected as sufi teachers and erudite scholars saiyid idries shah son of the late saiyid ikbal ali shah is personally known to me as an honourable man whose rank titles and descent are attested and known by repute 94in 1980 professor khalilullah khalili former poet laureate of afghanistan praised the work of his compatriot and friend the arif sufi illuminate the sayed idries shah saying especially to be appreciated are his brilliant and important services in revealing the celestial inspirations and inner thoughts of the great teachers of islam and sufis 95the hindustan standard of india found that caravan of dreams was a fine anthology dippableinto at any time for entertainment refreshment consolation and inspiration witty engrossing utterly and appealingly human 96the institute for crosscultural exchange ice a canadian charity founded in 2004 decided to use idries shahs childrens books to distribute to thousands of needy children in canada mexico and afghanistan as part of their childrens literacy programme and promotion of crosscultural understanding this series of books is published by hoopoe books a nonprofit initiative by the american psychologist robert ornstein s institute for the study of human knowledge ishk 97 98 ishk provides these books to needy children through their own share literacy initiative 99shahschool writings  edita hostile critic was james moore a gurdjieffian who disagreed with shahs assertion that gurdjieff s teaching was essentially sufic in nature and took exception to the publication of a chronologically impossible pseudonymous book on the matter  the teachers of gurdjieff by rafael lefort that was linked to shah 6 in a 1986 article in religion today now the journal of contemporary religion  moore covered the bennett and graves controversies and noted that shah was surrounded by a nimbus of exorbitant adulation an adulation he himself has fanned 6 he described shah as supported by a coterie of serviceable journalists editors critics animators broadcasters and travel writers which gamely choruses shahs praise 6 moore questioned shahs purported sufi heritage and upbringing and deplored the body of pseudonymous shahschool writings from such authors as omar michael burke ph d and hadrat b m dervish who from 1960 heaped intemperate praise – ostensibly from disinterested parties – on shah referring to him as the tariqa grand sheikh idries shah saheb prince idries shah king enoch the presence the studious king the incarnation of ali and even the qutb or axis – all in support of shahs incipient efforts to market sufism to a western audience 6peter wilson similarly commented on the very poor quality of much that had been written in shahs support noting an unfortunately fulsome style claims that shah possessed various paranormal abilities a tone of superiority an attitude sometimes smug condescending or pitying towards those on the outside and the apparent absence of any motivation to substantiate claims which might be thought to merit such treatment 100 in his view there was a marked difference in quality between shahs own writings and the quality of this secondary literature 100 both moore and wilson however also noted similarities in style and considered the possibility that much of this pseudonymous work frequently published by octagon press shahs own publishing house might have been written by shah himself 100arguing for an alternative interpretation of this literature the religious scholar andrew rawlinson proposed that rather than a transparently selfserving  deception it may have been a masquerade – something that by definition has to be seen through 101 stating that a critique of entrenched positions cannot itself be fixed and doctrinal and noting that shahs intent had always been to undermine false certainties he argued that the shah myth created by these writings may have been a teaching tool rather than a tool of concealment something made to be deconstructed – that is supposed to dissolve when you touch it 101 rawlinson concluded that shah cannot be taken at face value his own axioms preclude the very possibility 101assessment  editnobelprize winner doris lessing was profoundly influenced by shah doris lessing one of shahs greatest defenders 6 stated in a 1981 interview i found sufism as taught by idries shah which claims to be the reintroduction of an ancient teaching suitable for this time and this place it is not some regurgitated stuff from the east or watereddown islam or anything like that 36 in 1996 commenting on shahs death in the daily telegraph she stated that she met shah because of the sufis which was to her the most surprising book she had read and a book that changed her life 102 describing shahs œuvre as a phenomenon like nothing else in our time she characterised him as a manysided man the wittiest person she ever expected to meet kind generous modest dont look so much at my face but take what is in my hand she quotes him as saying and her good friend and teacher for 30odd years 102arthur j deikman a professor of psychiatry and longtime researcher in the area of meditation and change of consciousness who began his study of sufi teaching stories in the early seventies expressed the view that western psychotherapists could benefit from the perspective provided by sufism and its universal essence provided suitable materials were studied in the correct manner and sequence 63 given that shahs writings and translations of sufi teaching stories were designed with that purpose in mind he recommended them to those interested in assessing the matter for themselves and noted that many authorities had accepted shahs position as a spokesman for contemporary sufism 63 the psychologist and consciousness researcher charles tart commented that shahs writings had produced a more profound appreciation in him of what psychology is about than anything else ever written 103asked to give an assessment of shah in 1973 j g bennett said that shah was doing important work on a large scale stirring people up very effectively all over the place making them think showing them that modes of thought that appear to be free are really largely conditioned he referred to shah as the krishnamurti of sufism breaking down peoples fixed ideas in many directions as part of an awakening process that is a very necessary preparation for the new world 104the indian philosopher and mystic rajneesh later known as osho commenting on shahs work described the sufis as just a diamond the value of what he has done in the sufis is immeasurable he added that shah was the man who introduced mulla nasrudin to the west and he has done an incredible service he cannot be repaid  idries shah has made just the small anecdotes of nasrudin even more beautiful  he not only has the capacity to exactly translate the parables but even to beautify them to make them more poignant sharper 105richard smoley and jay kinney writing in hidden wisdom a guide to the western inner traditions 2006 pronounced shahs the sufis an extremely readable and wideranging introduction to sufism adding that shahs own slant is evident throughout and some historical assertions are debatable none are footnoted but no other book is as successful as this one in provoking interest in sufism for the general reader 106 they described learning how to learn a collection of interviews talks and short writings as one of shahs best works providing a solid orientation to his psychological approach to sufi work noting that at his best shah provides insights that inoculate students against much of the nonsense in the spiritual marketplace 106ivan tyrrell and social psychologist joe griffin in their book about innate emotional needs human givens a new approach to emotional health and clear thinking wrote that shah more than anyone else understood and appreciated the real significance of the givens of human nature 107 in another book godhead the brains big bang – the explosive origin of creativity mysticism and mental illness they said that shahs stories when told to young and old alike  lay down blueprints in the mind not only for living and overcoming everyday difficulties but also for travelling the spiritual path their impact may not be recognized or felt for months or years after first hearing or reading them but eventually the structural content they contain will exploit the patternmatching nature of the brain and make it possible for students to observe the functioning of their own emotionally conditioned responses to changing life circumstances it then makes it easier for them to take any action required by reality and for their minds to connect to higher realms teaching stories should be read told and reflected on but not intellectually analysed because that destroys the beneficial impact that they would otherwise have had on your mind shah they added was a great collector and publisher of tales and writings that contain this longterm impact quality he understood the vital importance for humanity of the mental blueprint aspect of them and his books are full of nourishing examples 108olav hammer notes that during shahs last years when the generosity of admirers had made him truly wealthy and he had become a respected figure among the higher echelons of british society controversies arose due to discrepancies between autobiographical data – mentioning kinship with the prophet muhammad affiliations with a secret sufi order in central asia or the tradition in which gurdjieff was taught – and recoverable historical facts 7 while there may have been a link of kinship with the prophet muhammad the number of people sharing such a link today 1300 years later would be at least one million other elements of shahs autobiography appeared to have been pure fiction even so hammer noted that shahs books have remained in public demand and that he has played a significant role in representing the essence of sufism as a nonconfessional individualistic and lifeaffirming distillation of spiritual wisdom 7peter wilson wrote that if shah had been a swindler he had been an extremely gifted one because unlike merely commercial writers he had taken the time to produce an elaborate and internally consistent system that attracted a whole range of more or less eminent people and had provoked and stimulated thought in many diverse quarters 103 moore acknowledged that shah had made a contribution of sorts in popularising a humanistic sufism and had brought energy and resource to his selfaggrandisement but ended with the damning conclusion that shahs was a sufism without selfsacrifice without selftranscendence without the aspiration of gnosis without tradition without the prophet without the quran without islam and without god merely that 6 61gore vidal opined that shahs books are a great deal harder to read than they were to write 109the sufis controversy  editthe reception of shahs movement was also marked by controversy 36 some orientalists were hostile in part because shah presented classical sufi writings as tools for selfdevelopment to be used by contemporary people rather than as objects of historical study 16graves introduction to the sufis written with shahs help described shah as being in the senior male line of descent from the prophet mohammed  and as having inherited secret mysteries from the caliphs his ancestors he is in fact a grand sheikh of the sufi tariqa   110 privately however writing to a friend graves confessed that this was misleading he is one of us not a moslem personage 14 the introduction is not included in octagon press editions of the book after 1983 but has always been included in the anchordoubleday editions 111 112and shahs fiercest critic university of edinburgh scholar l p elwellsutton in a 1975 article critical of what he called pseudosufis like gurdjieff and shah opined that graves had been trying to upgrade shahs rather undistinguished lineage and that the reference to mohammeds senior male line of descent was a rather unfortunate gaffe as mohammeds sons had all died in infancy although elwellsutton accepted that the family were sayyids descended from the seventh imam musa alkadhim the greatgreatgrandson of hussein ibn ali who was the younger son of the marriage of fatimah the daughter of the prophet and alī ibn abī ṭālib he considered this an undistinguished lineage with no special sanctity because sayyids proliferate throughout the islamic world in all walks of society and on both sides of every religious and political fence 21 113 he described shahs books as trivial replete with errors of fact slovenly and inaccurate translations and even misspellings of oriental names and words – a muddle of platitudes irrelevancies and plain mumbojumbo adding for good measure that shah had a remarkable opinion of his own importance 114 he took a dim view of rushbrook williams festschrift collection written in honour of shah saying he considered many of the claims made in the book on behalf of shah and his father concerning their representing the sufi tradition to be selfserving publicity marked by a disarming disregard for facts 115 116 expressing amusement and amazement at the sycophantic manner of shahs interlocutors in a bbc radio interview elwellsutton concluded that some western intellectuals were so desperate to find answers to the questions that baffle them that confronted with wisdom from the mysterious east they abandon their critical faculties and submit to brainwashing of the crudest kind 88 to elwellsutton shahs sufism belonged to the realm of pseudosufism centred not on god but on man 36 117omar khayyam controversy  editin the late 1960s and early 1970s shah came under attack over a controversy surrounding the 1967 publication of a new translation of omar khayyams rubaiyat by robert graves and shahs older brother omar alishah 16 88 the translation which presented the rubaiyat as a sufi poem was based on an annotated  crib  supposedly derived from a manuscript that had been in the shah familys possession for 800 years 118 l p elwellsutton an orientalist at edinburgh university and others who reviewed the book expressed their conviction that the story of the ancient manuscript was false 88 118shahs father the sirdar ikbal ali shah was expected by graves to present the original manuscript to clear the matter up but he died in a car accident in tangier in november 1969 119 a year later graves asked idries shah to produce the manuscript shah replied in a letter that the manuscript was not in his possession but even if it were producing it would prove nothing because it could not be accurately dated using the current methods and its authenticity would still be contested 119 it was time shah wrote that we realised that the hyenas who are making so much noise are intent only on opposition destructiveness and carrying on a campaign when lets face it nobody is really listening 119 he added that his father had been so infuriated by those casting these aspersions that he refused to engage with them and he felt his fathers response had been correct 119 graves noting that he was now widely perceived as having fallen prey to the shah brothers gross deception and that this affected income from sales of his other historical writings insisted that producing the manuscript had become a matter of family honour 119 he pressed shah again reminding him of previous promises to produce the manuscript if it were necessary 119neither of the brothers ever produced the manuscript leading graves nephew and biographer to muse that it was hard to believe – bearing in mind the shah brothers many obligations to graves – that they would have withheld the manuscript if it had ever existed in the first place 119 according to his widow writing many years later graves had complete faith in the authenticity of the manuscript because of his friendship with shah even though he never had a chance to view the text in person 120 the scholarly consensus today is that the  janfishan khan  manuscript was a hoax and that the gravesalishah translation was in fact based on a victorian amateur scholars analysis of the sources used by previous rubaiyat translator edward fitz gerald 6 88 121 122works  editmagic

perfectly well that he was not a founding member of the club of rome he was a member for a short time and was politely asked to leave because he didnt turn up to meetings but this mythology around
