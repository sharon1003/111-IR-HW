editor’s note this story originally ran in march of 2012 we’re rerunning in honor of k9 veteran’s day march 13 2015 until the nowfamous navy seal team six raid on osama bin laden’s compound last year most people had no idea that dogs are a vital part of the military but these fourlegged heroes have saved tens of thousands of lives since world war ii when the u s embarked on its military working dog program i grew up steeped in the importance of war dogs thanks to my dad who was a very young soldier back then he told me about the bonds the handlers had with their dogs and how the dogs – as important as they were on missions – were just as essential for the morale of troops his stories struck a chord with me and i was thrilled years later when i got a chance to write a book about brave loyal amazing dogs and their devoted handlers my book soldier dogs the untold story of america’s canine heroes was published two weeks ago and i’m excited that after all the hard work and bootsontheground reporting the book entailed people are really starting to take notice of these incredible dogs and their handlers the book has received a lot of attention including a great review in the april 9 2012 edition of people magazine and a fun stint for me on the daily show update soldier dogs is a new york times best seller this puts a wag in my tail because i am passionate about these dog teams the more people know about them the better off the dogs and handlers will be so today i bring my loyal dogster readers an exclusive look at 10 things you may really want to know about soldier dogs all photos except the plane jumper are of dogs and handlers featured in my book here’s to our pawsontheground heroes  note from dogster hq we read and loved maria’s book and think you’ll dig it too besides getting it at your local bookstore you can order soldier dogs from amazon barnes and noble or indiebound it’s even available as an audiobook for all you commuters in the house at blackstone audio  a job well done for his detection of an explosives scent a dog in training gets the ultimate reward his handlers heartfelt praise and a kong  a rubber toy beloved by most mwds photo copyright jared dort1 soldier dogs are selected for the military based in part on their love of a ball or a kong this reward is going to be part of their “paycheck” for years to come a handler’s heartfelt praise is the other part and they have to want the ball really badly to work as hard as they need to in order to save lives in combat situationskong is king in military working dog training these hard rubber toys play a vital almost magical role in training photo copyright jared dort2 soldier dogs believe in magic if they didn’t they may not be the lifesavers they are the main job for military dogs in today’s wars is sniffing out ieds which are the number one killer in afghanistan but how does a dog get to know the difference between an explosive and an interestingsmelling rock magic of a sort a dog’s early encounters associating a scent with a reward are all about the surprising appearance of a kong that seems to spring right out of the scent itself trainers hide a kong toy or ball somewhere and place a few drops of a scent in the area when the dog hits the scent he thinks “whoa i’ve never smelled this before” and shows a tiny change of behavior perhaps stopping or wagging or tilting his head at that moment a trainer throws the ball so it lands right on the source of the odor and the dog is cheered on for his “feat”this happens a few more times placing the odor in various spots and having a ball “magically” land on it when the dog successfully sniffs the odor many dogs learn extremely rapidly to associate an odor and a ball eventually they’re weaned from this and get the ball reward in a different way that dogs can believe the scent of something like potassium chlorate magically creates a bouncing kong is just one of those things that makes them so loveable and endearingdog handler marine corp max donahue stateside with mwd ronni his first dog  military or otherwise donahue like most handlers bonded deeply with the two military dogs who served with him and viceversa photo courtesy of julie schrock3 the bond between a deployed handler and soldier dog is like no other i was blown away by the love that even the toughest of these soldiers sailors airmen and marines have for their canine comrades when you’re at war and you’re together almost 247 sometimes sharing a tent or even a sleeping bag or foxhole for weeks on end when you depend on each other for everything including your very lives an incomparable bond forms hearing a warhardened marine’s voice break when he talks about his best friend is a very moving experienceyou dont have to be a big dog to be a soldier dog lars j274 a jack russell terrier with a napoleon complex proves that smaller is better for some jobs as he gets handed down into a nuclear submarine so he can sniff it out for explosives u s navy photo by petty officer 2nd class paul d williams for soldier dogs4 not all soldier dogs are big tough warriors sure breeds like german shepherds and belgian malinois are the most common war dogs these days but affable labrador retrievers play a major role as sniffer dogs in afghanistan and there are also some very little dogs in the military but i learned that “little” does not mean “diminutive”i had the pleasure of meeting a jack russell terrier lars j274 on a nuclear submarine as he sniffed around for explosives last summer he was a jaunty little fellow with a napoleon complex submariners would laugh has he trotted down the narrow walkways but he didn’t care “inside he’s a big dog with a big attitude” his handler told medogs know us much better than we may think they do their ability to read people comes in especially handy during war situations the dog above rex l274 was a gentle giant of a german shepherd who was always there when someone needed a helping paw photo courtesy of amanda ingraham5 dogs are the ultimate anthropologists they study us they observe us they smell changes in our very chemistry they learn to predict us and they seem to know when their people are having a bad day rex l274 was a big sensitive german shepherd he had failed out of aggression training because anytime he bit someone wearing protective gear during practice and they yelled or screamed in response he immediately let go and seemed to look concerned and sad so his career path changed and he became a highly trained offleash bomb sniffer his sensitivity to the people around him played out in the form of becoming a sort of unofficial therapy dog wherever he went “he’d always find the one soldier who was having a hard day and hang out with them” his handler army sgt amanda ingraham told me his favorite therapy was to cheer up down soldiers by getting them to play with a water bottle after all he liked playing with water bottles so it would seem natural that they would too he’d run up and bonk them with a water bottle empty or full it didn’t matter or he’d sit next to him crunching the bottle and periodically banging it against the soldier with the blues eventually the soldier would take the bait and a grand game of tugofwar or a big chase would ensuespecial operations dogs can perform stunning feats of bravery from great heights photo by tech sgt manuel j martinez u s air force6 some dogs really do jump from planes these extremely resilient superhighdrive dogs are specially procured and trained by military contractors not the dod’s military working dog program some join their human partners in parachute jumps from planes others rappel with their handlers from helicopters the dogs who do this are known as multipurpose canines mpcs and are used used in special operations teams including the navy seals they’re a tiny subset of military dogs but can serve very important roles as cairo the dog involved in the seal team six raid on the bin laden compound demonstratedlynette and larry sergeant the caring couple that adopted buck p207 have been trying everything to help him with his canine ptsd he is very comfortable with them and loves the new puppy they adopted to keep him company but he still has a great deal of healing ahead photo copyright estella diaz7 soldier dogs can get ptsd until last year canine post traumatic stress disorder wasn’t officially recognized by the military but now that it is it’s being taken very seriously signs of canine ptsd include hypervigilance increased startle response attempts to run away or escape withdrawal changes in rapport with a handler and problems performing trained tasks – like a bomb dog who just can’t focus on sniffing out bombs any more as with people some dogs can go to hell and back and not be badly scarred others are profoundly affected by less there are treatments but they aren’t as effective as they need to be research into canine ptsd is in its infancy but i hope it will one day soon offer some better solutions for the dogs who are suffering so while at lackland air force base which is where most military dogs get trained i visited the base’s adoption kennels and was greeted by the loads of barking energetic dogs but this one beautiful chocolate lab buck p027 was curled up tightly staring out into nothingness it turns out buck had been a bomb dog in afghanistan he may have seen too much action or been close to one too many explosions it was really heartbreaking to see this dog who was crushed by ptsd lying alone thankfully the next day he went home with a couple who loves him to pieces they’re working on helping him through his ptsd every day i am in touch with them and get regular reports on his progresswhat’s in a name ask davy n532 a female dog whose name does not match her gender oddball names are not uncommon among military working dogs whose breeders usually from europe name them photo courtesy of marcus bates8 soldier dog names can be downright embarrassing to their handlers dogs are named by their breeders who are hail from places like the czech republic slovakia the netherlands and germany there are plenty of regal or at least normal names like rex nero and rocky and then there are the unfortunate or oddball ones imagine being downrange in a lifeordeath situation and shouting for “baby cakes” “baby bear” “busty” or “moo” yes those are real military working dog names male dogs sometimes have female names like kitty or freida and viceversa the handler of freida said it was very awkward calling his name he swears the breeders are just messing with american handlers and i have a feeling he’s rightwhen a military working dog dies his foodwater bowl is turned upside down and his harness and collar hung up to symbolize he wont be needing them anymore photo courtesy emily pieracci9 when soldier dogs die their memorial services will rip your heart out their bowls are placed upside down to symbolize that they won’t need them anymore their collars and leashes are hung up in remembrance of the dog and if the memorial is at a kennel the dog’s kennel door is left open indicating the dog will not be returning home the handler or someone who can handle the heartbreaking duty reads a poem called guardians of the night i can’t even think about it without tearing up a lot of handlers can’t eitherdogs are anything but equipment to their handlers military working dog blek h199 and his handler air force staff sergeant brent olson had a rough deployment together both were badly injured today blek is part of olsons family olson was able to adopt him after the dog was retired due to his injuries photo courtesy of brent olson10 soldier dogs are still officially considered equipment by the defense department most handlers consider their dogs their best friends but to the dod military working dogs are still officially equipment“i try to articulate dog is not a piece of equipment but a working breathing animal that needs to be treated respectfully and kindly” says air force senior master sergeant antonio arod rodriguez “your dog is your partner and values meaningful interaction you just don’t think about equipment in the same way”there’s some fantastic legislation in congress right now that seeks to change this status you can read about it in a post i wrote for dogster in it i explain how you can weigh in on this very important bipartisan bill the canine members of the armed forces act these dogs deserve all the support we can give them read more about
