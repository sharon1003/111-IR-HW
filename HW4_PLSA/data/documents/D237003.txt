further information blowout well drillingrelief wells are used both in the natural gas and petroleum industry and in flood control in the natural gas and petroleum industry a relief well is drilled to intersect an oil or gas well that has experienced a blowout specialized liquid such as heavy dense drilling mud followed by cement can then be pumped down the relief well in order to stop the flow from the reservoir in the damaged well in flood control a different type of relief well is used adjacent to earthen levees to relieve the pressure on the lake or river side of the levee and thus to prevent the collapse of the levee the greater flow of water in the water source typically during a flood creates a pressure gradient such that more water infiltrates the soil of the levee water may then flow through the soil towards the dry side of the levee resulting in sand boil liquefaction of the soil and ultimately destruction of the levee relief wells act like valves to relieve the water pressure and allow excess water to be diverted safely for example to a canal relief wells can prevent sand boils from occurring by relieving the water pressure as described the first use of a relief well was in texas in the mid1930s when one was drilled to pump water into an oil well that had cratered and caught on fire 1references and external links  edithow a relief well works  gulf of mexico response  bp retrieved 20100516 ieee spectrum how to drill a relief well retrieved 20100805 relief well design approach hhd case study pdf retrieved 20120805 wild oil well tamed by scientific trick popular mechanics july 1934this article related to natural gas petroleum or the petroleum industry is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it
