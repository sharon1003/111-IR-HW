considered very carefully please read the following to understand the best approach to manage pain the recognition of pain can be difficult for a several reasons we know that animals try to hide pain from us as a natural protective instinct we also fail to understand our animals communication of pain most pets that require major oral surgery have moderate to severe pain from their underlying problem such as cups feline stomatitis  jaw fracture  oral tumors or tmj fracture  some conditions requiring major oral surgery are less painful such as the dentigerous cysts open mouth jaw locking or tmj ankylosis dr kressin believes that any medical condition or surgical procedure that might be painful for humans is definitely painful for pets it is our obligation to eliminate or minimize pain for our animals we do this before during and after surgical procedures using a balanced approach to anesthesia in planning anesthesia for the surgery the current pain status and the anticipated surgical procedure are considered when choosing preoperative intraoperative and postoperative pain medications every attempt is made to eliminate or minimize pain many clients have been impressed that their pets seem less painful very soon after major oral surgery will my pet be able to eat and how soon after surgery most pets will be eating food within 612 hours after major oral surgery it is advised to feed small portions of food every few hours for the first 24 hours after surgery what will my pet be able to eat and how frequently do i feed them in most cases sutures that dissolve are used for major oral surgery we advise the use of canned food or moistened kibble after surgery for a period of 1014 days it may take time for your pet to adjust to changes created from the surgery when eating it is usually helpful to encourage pets to eat from your hand after major oral surgery to get through the adjustment period there will be some messes associated with salivation lapping of food and water what will my pet look like and will there be disfigurement the pets appearance after major oral surgery of the lower jaws is remarkably close to normal even after mandibulectomy procedures the tongue may hang out of the mouth where bone has been removed see clinical photos below in time this may become less noticable there may also be an increased flow of saliva after major oral surgery occasionally some pets will have facial swelling which typically resolves without treatment within a few weeks a clicking sound is common after partial mandibulectomy procedures due to the upper and lower teeth comming into occlusion when closing the mouth in most pets the clicking sound becomes dramatically reduced or goes away after a few months patients having condylectomy appear very close to normal this is because the mandibles remain in a near normal position due to the mandibular symphysis stabilization for patients with maxillectomy there may be a slight narrowing appearance of the nose many of these surgeries are not noticed by family and friends what can i expect from surgery for my pet expectations from surgery and the surgical prognosis are dependent on the procedure performed and the underlying problem most pets recover rapidly from major surgery within 24 to 48 hours many seem nearly unaffected other than mild sedation will i need to provide nursing
