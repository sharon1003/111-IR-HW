set program in cardiothoracic surgery is six years in duration usually commencing several years after completing medical school training is administered and supervised via a binational australia and new zealand training program multiple examinations take place throughout the course of training culminating in a final fellowship exam in the final year of training upon completion of training surgeons are awarded a fellowship of the royal australasian college of surgeons fracs denoting that they are qualified specialists trainees having completed a training program in general surgery and have obtained their fracs will have the option to complete fellowship training in cardiothoracic surgery of four year in duration subject to college approval it takes around eight to ten years minimum of postgraduate postmedical school training to qualify as a cardiothoracic surgeon competition for training places and for public teaching hospital places is very high currently leading to concerns regarding workforce planning in australia canada  edithistorically cardiac surgeons in canada completed general surgery followed by a fellowship in cv  ct  cvt during the 1990s the canadian cardiac surgery training programs changed to sixyear directentry programs following medical school the directentry format provides residents with experience related to cardiac surgery they would not receive

apply for a specialty place or core surgical training which is less competitive than going straight into the speciality if you go for the core surgical training you can then apply on the third year for cardiothoracic surgery which at that point is much less competitive once youre training for the speciality you may choose to subspecialise in perhaps aortic surgery adult cardiac surgery thoracic surgery paediatric cardiothoracic surgery adult congenital surgery this is a rewarding and technically challenging speciality similar to interventional cardiology in some aspects united states  editsurgeon operating cardiac surgery training in the united states is combined with general thoracic surgery and called cardiothoracic surgery or thoracic surgery a cardiothoracic surgeon in the u s is a physician  d o or m d who first completes a general surgery residency typically 5–7 years followed by a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship typically 2–3 years the cardiothoracic surgery fellowship typically spans two or three years but certification is based on the number of surgeries performed as the operating surgeon not the time spent in the program in addition to passing rigorous board certification tests recently however options for an integrated 6year cardiothoracic residency in place of the general surgery residency plus cardiothoracic residency have been established at many programs over 20 2 applicants match into these i6 programs directly out of medical school and the application process has been extremely competitive for these positions as there were approximately 160

bypass surgery note the use of a steel retractor to forcefully maintain the exposure of the patients heart icd9cm 35  37me sh d006348ops301 code 535537  edit on wikidatathe earliest operations on the pericardium the sac that surrounds the heart took place in the 19th century and were performed by francisco romero 1801 3 dominique jean larrey henry dalton and daniel hale williams 4 the first surgery on the heart itself was performed by norwegian surgeon axel cappelen on 4 september 1895 at rikshospitalet in kristiania now oslo he ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24yearold man who had been stabbed in the left axilla and was in deep shock upon arrival access was through a left thoracotomy the patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours but became ill with increasing temperature and he ultimately died from what the post mortem proved to be mediastinitis on the third postoperative day 5 6 the first successful surgery of the heart performed without any complications was by ludwig rehn of frankfurt germany who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on september 7 1896 7 8surgery in great vessels  aortic coarctation repair blalocktaussig shunt creation closure of patent ductus arteriosus became common after the turn of the century and falls in the domain of cardiac surgery but technically cannot be considered heart surgery one of the more commonly known cardiac surgery procedures is the coronary artery bypass graft cabg also known as bypass surgery in this procedure vessels from elsewhere in the patients body are harvested and grafted to the coronary arteries to bypass blockages and improve the blood supply to the heart muscle early approaches to heart malformations  editin 1925 operations on the heart valves were unknown henry souttar operated successfully on a young woman with mitral stenosis he made an opening in the appendage of the left atrium and inserted a finger into this chamber in order to palpate and explore the damaged mitral valve the patient survived for several years 9 but souttars physician colleagues at that time decided the procedure was not justified and he could not continue 10 11cardiac surgery changed significantly after world war ii in 1948 four surgeons carried out successful operations for mitral stenosis resulting from rheumatic fever horace smithy 1914–1948 of charlotte revived an operation due to dr dwight harken of the peter bent brigham hospital using a punch to remove a portion of the mitral valve charles bailey 1910–1993 at the hahnemann hospital philadelphia dwight harken in boston and russell brock at guys hospital all adopted souttars method all these men started work independently of each other within a few months this time souttars technique was widely adopted although there were modifications 10 11in 1947 thomas holmes sellors 1902–1987 of the middlesex hospital operated on a fallots tetralogy patient with pulmonary stenosis and successfully divided the stenosed pulmonary valve in 1948 russell brock probably unaware of sellors work used a specially designed dilator in three cases of pulmonary stenosis later in 1948 he designed a punch to resect the infundibular muscle stenosis which is often associated with fallots tetralogy many thousands of these blind operations were performed until the introduction of heart bypass made direct surgery on valves possible 10open heart surgery  editopen heart surgery is a procedure in which the patients heart is opened and surgery is performed on the internal structures of the heart it was discovered by wilfred g bigelow of the university of toronto that the repair of intracardiac pathologies was better done with a bloodless and motionless environment which means that the heart should be stopped and drained of blood the first successful intracardiac correction of a congenital heart defect using hypothermia was performed by c walton lillehei and f john lewis at the university of minnesota on september 2 1952 the following year soviet surgeon aleksandr aleksandrovich vishnevskiy conducted the first cardiac surgery under local anesthesia surgeons realized the limitations of hypothermia – complex intracardiac repairs take more time and the patient needs blood flow to the body particularly to the brain the patient needs the function of the heart and lungs provided by an artificial method hence the term cardiopulmonary bypass john heysham gibbon at jefferson medical school in philadelphia reported in 1953 the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation by means of an oxygenator but he abandoned the method disappointed by subsequent failures in 1954 lillehei realized a successful series of operations with the controlled crosscirculation technique in which the patients mother or father was used as a  heartlung machine  john w kirklin at the mayo clinic in rochester minnesota started using a gibbon type pumpoxygenator in a series of successful operations and was soon followed by surgeons in various parts of the world nazih zuhdi performed the first total intentional hemodilution open heart surgery on terry gene nix age 7 on february 25 1960 at mercy hospital oklahoma city ok the operation was a success however nix died three years later in 1963 12 in march 1961 zuhdi carey and greer performed open heart surgery on a child age 3 1⁄ 2 using the total intentional hemodilution machine in 1985 zuhdi performed oklahomas first successful heart transplant on nancy rogers at baptist hospital the transplant was successful but rogers a cancer sufferer died from an infection 54 days after surgery 13modern beatingheart surgery  editsince the 1990s surgeons have begun to perform  offpump bypass surgery  – coronary artery bypass surgery without the aforementioned cardiopulmonary bypass in these operations the heart is beating during surgery but is stabilized to provide an almost still work area in which to connect the conduit vessel that bypasses the blockage in the u s most conduit vessels are harvested endoscopically using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting evh some researchers believe that the offpump approach results in fewer postoperative complications such as postperfusion syndrome and better overall results study results are controversial as of 2007 the surgeons preference and hospital results still play a major role minimally invasive surgery  edita new form of heart surgery that has grown in popularity is robotassisted heart surgery this is where a machine is used to perform surgery while being controlled by the heart surgeon the main advantage to this is the size of the incision made in the patient instead of an incision being at least big enough for the surgeon to put his hands inside it does not have to be bigger than 3 small holes for the robots much smaller hands to get through pediatric cardiovascular surgery  editpediatric cardiovascular surgery is surgery of the heart of children the first operations to repair heart defects in children were performed by clarence crafoord in sweden when he repaired coarctation of the aorta in a 12yearold boy 14 the first attempts to palliate congenital heart disease were performed by alfred blalock with the assistance of william longmire denton cooley and blalocks experienced technician vivien thomas in 1944 at johns hopkins hospital 15 techniques for repair of congenital heart defects without the use of a bypass machine were developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s among them was an open repair of an atrial septal defect using hypothermia inflow occlusion and direct vision in a 5year old child performed in 1952 by lewis and tauffe c walter lillihei used crosscirculation between a boy and his father to maintain perfusion while performing a direct repair of a ventricular septal defect in a 4 year old child in 1954 16 he continued to use crosscirculation and performed the first corrections of tetratology of fallot and presented those results in 1955 at the american surgical association in the longrun pediatric cardiovascular surgery would rely on the cardiopulmonary bypass machine developed by gibbon and lillehei as noted above risks of cardiac surgery  editthe development of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques has reduced the mortality rates of these surgeries to relatively low ranks for instance repairs of congenital heart defects are currently estimated to have 4–6 mortality rates 17 18 a major concern with cardiac surgery is the incidence of neurological damage stroke occurs in 5 of all people undergoing cardiac surgery and is higher in patients at risk for stroke 19 a more subtle constellation of neurocognitive deficits attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass is known as postperfusion syndrome sometimes called pumphead the symptoms of postperfusion syndrome were initially felt to be permanent 20 but were shown to be transient with no permanent neurological impairment 21in order to assess the performance of surgical units and individual surgeons a popular risk model has been created called the euro score this takes a number of health factors from a patient and using precalculated logistic regression coefficients attempts to give a percentage chance of survival to discharge within the uk this euro score was used to give a breakdown of all the centres for cardiothoracic surgery and to give some indication of whether the units and their individuals surgeons performed within an acceptable range the results are available on the cqc website 22 the precise methodology used has however not been published to date nor has the raw data on which the results are based infection represents the primary noncardiac complication from cardiothoracic surgery infections can include mediastinitis infectious myo or pericarditis endocarditis cardiac device infection pneumonia empyema and bloodstream infections clostridum difficile colitis can also develop when prophylactic or postoperative antibiotics are used thoracic surgery  edita pleurectomy is a surgical procedure in which part of the pleura is removed it is sometimes used in the treatment of pneumothorax and mesothelioma 23lung volume reduction surgery  editlung volume reduction surgery or lvrs can improve the quality of life for certain copd and emphysema patients parts of the lung that are particularly damaged by emphysema are removed allowing the remaining relatively good lung to expand and work more efficiently conventional lvrs involves resection of the most severely affected areas of emphysematous non bullous lung aim is for 2030 this is a surgical option involving a minithoracotomy for patients suffering end stage copd due to underlying emphysema and can improve lung elastic recoil as well as diaphragmatic function the national emphysema treatment trial was a large multicentre study n  1218 comparing lvrs with nonsurgical treatment results suggested that there was no overall survival advantage in the lvrs group except for mainly upperlobe emphysema  poor exercise capacity and significant improvements were seen in exercise capacity in the lvrs group 24possible complications of lvrs include prolonged air leak mean duration post surgery until all chest tubes removed is 109 ± 80 days 25in people who have a predominantly upper lobe emphysema lung volume reduction surgery could result in better health status and lung function though it also increases the risk of early mortality and adverse events 26lvrs is used widely in europe though its application in the united states is mostly experimental 27lung cancer surgery  editnot all lung cancers are suitable for surgery the stage location and cell type are important limiting factors in addition people who are very ill with a poor performance status or who have inadequate pulmonary reserve would be unlikely to survive even with careful selection the overall operative death rate is about 44 28in nonsmall cell lung cancer staging stages ia ib iia and iib are suitable for surgical resection 29pulmonary reserve is measured by spirometry if there is no evidence of undue shortness of
