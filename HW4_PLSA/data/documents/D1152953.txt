cloudy pool water why  how to remedy18by adrian on september 1 2014 pool maintenance pool problems please share we’ve all been there one day your pool is a bright crystal clear sparkling oasis the next it’s suddenly turned hazy cloudy or even milky and looks about as inviting as a sheep dip what caused it and how do you fix it what makes pool water turn cloudy pool water becomes cloudy when large numbers of tiny particles of matter are either introduced into or fall out of solution from the water these particles reflect back light – thereby resulting in the appearance of a cloudy swimming pool the particles themselves can come from any number of sources human sources – sun screen oilslotions skin proteins body oils perspiration bodily fluids environmental sources – algae pollen leaf mold dust fine sand chemical sources – calcium carbonate calcium hypochlorite there are two important things to know about the particles – important because they’ll help make sense of how to treat and get rid of them they are extremely small anything from 05 to 50 microns by way of perspective an average grain of sand is around 1000 microns since most pool filter systems cannot deal with anything much above 30 microns they are therefore too tiny to be easily caught by the pool’s filtration they carry a negative electrical charge that means they repel each other and each particle hangs in isolated suspension in the pool water why does knowing this matter because some of the treatment methods involve actually changing the particles’ electrical charge so that they stick together into large enough coagulated particles that your pool filtration system can deal with them how cloudy is cloudy there are varying degrees of cloudiness and the degree of cloudiness often is a clue to the cause and determines the appropriate treatment dull or flat – the pool water seems to have lost its sparkle a bit like the difference between gloss and matte paint hazy – more than just appearing dull or flat the water actually isn’t clear anymore you can see the bottom of the pool but not distinctly cloudy – the water has a definite milky quality at the shallow end you can see the bottom of the pool but at the deep end you have to stare pretty hard opaque – very milky pool water you can’t see the bottom at all why is my pool cloudy just as there are any number of sources there are any number of reasons why these particles suddenly appear and very often there’s not so much a single reason as a number of different reasons which combine together and feed off one another with the end result that your pool water turns cloudy mechanical reasons very often the reason that your pool is cloudy is simply because it is receiving insufficient filtration insufficient filtration time pools need 8 hours of filtration a day and if you’re pump isn’t running long enough it’s not going to be able to filter the water properly inadequate filtration equipment if the filter size is too small or the pump itself is too small for the size of your pool the result can often be cloudy pool water inappropriate filtration equipment equally if your pool pump has too large a horsepower motor for your pool size the water will be driven too fast through the filter and you’ll actually get reduced filtration dirty or damaged filtration equipment if you have a sand filter make sure it’s clean the filter basket clear and that you backwash until the water runs clear also if you have a multispeed pump make sure you’re not backwashing on low if you have a pool cartridge filter check that it doesn’t need either cleaning or replacing inadequate circulation this could be the result of valves being closed when they should be open or open when they should be closed equally skimmer baskets may be blocked by leaves plastic toys etc human reasons you’ve probably noticed after a day of heavy pool use especially after a pool party the water is looking a dull or hazy the reason is the pool’s chlorine has been fighting to cope with all that sun screensuntan lotion body oils hair oils and bodily fluids – including especially pee what happens is that the chlorine reacts with all of these and especially with the ammonia that rapidly breaks down from urine the insoluble waste products of which process are called chloramines chloramines don’t just make the water slightly cloudy they give it that unpleasant and alltoo characteristic chlorine smell environmental reasons if it’s in the air or on the ground anywhere near the pool whether it comes from mother nature or from a nearby construction site the chances are it’s going to get into the water pollen dust leaf mold etc the particles may be too fine for your pool system to be able to filter them out water runoff the problem is the phosphates nitrates and other chemicals that get washed from the backyard into the pool during a particularly heavy downpour that can cause the pool to become hazy or cloudy insects animals bird droppings dead things in the pool or bird droppings in the water have the same indeed more effect on producing chloramines as human waste products algae a cloudy pool may herald the onset of an algae bloom – especially if the water also has a greenish tinge to it the water might start out looking hazy but the green color will develop quickly for a thorough discussion about algae check out our article green pool – guide to preventing  removing pool algae also if you’ve recently treated your pool for an algae infection the water will be cloudy that’s because what you’re now seeing is dead white algae to be sure dead algae are a lot better than live algae but your pool cloudy until you vacuum it away chemical reasons the chemistry of your pool water including is chlorination p h and alkalinity levels are all common causes of pool cloudiness high p h when the p h level of the pool becomes too high over 78 the water is no longer able to hold calcium carbonate in solution instead of being held in solution it becomes held in suspension result a cloudy pool additionally at high p h levels chlorine loses much of its potency to destroy bacteria or algae the net effect can result in early algae growth – thereby further adding to the cloudiness calcium hypochlorite cloudy pool water can be the result of overuse of granular calcium hypochlorite shock treatment high total alkalinity if the total alkalinity of the pool is too high over 170 ppm cloudy water can easily result water temperature and calcium hardness ch water sourced from limestonerich areas is often high in calcium calcium dissolves more easily in cold than warm water and when the water temperature exceeds much above 29ᵒ c it falls out of solution into suspension how to fix a cloudy pool the good news is that in most cases the fix for how to clear a cloudy pool is fairly simple all that’s normally required is the administration of the correct dose of a water clarifier andor flocculants remember the two important things about the particles they’re small and they repel each other because they’re all negatively charged the way that clarifiers and flocculants work is that they neutralise the electric charge so that the particles bond together into something either big enough to be filtered or else heavy enough to sink to the bottom of the pool for later vacuuming the important thing however is don’t use too much using too much won’t just neutralise the electrical charge it will reverse it the result will make the pool even cloudier for dullflat or hazy water start the pump running adjust the p h to between 72 and 76 add the recommended dose of clarifier for your pool size keep the pump and filter system running for 12 hours for cloudy water start the pump running adjust the p h to between 72 and 76 add the recommended dose of clarifier for your pool size keep the pump and filter system running for 8 hours turn off the pump and allow the pool to rest for 810 hours vacuum the pool thoroughly and run to waste run the pump for another 4 hours for hazy or cloudy water caused by algae if you’re certain it’s algae apply and algae treatment and then perform the appropriate steps above if you’re not sure you’ll know it’s algae if you perform the steps above and the cloudiness returns and probably gets worse within a day or so in which case apply an antialgae treatment repeat the steps above for opaque water add water to the pool above the skimmer box line adjust the p h to 78 if you have a sand filter set it to recirculate if you have a pool cartridge filter remove the cartridge start the pump running add the recommended dose of flocculant for your pool size keep the pump running for 23 hours turn off the pump and allow the pool to rest for 1012 hours vacuum the pool thoroughly and run to waste if the water is still cloudy let the pool rest for another 24 hours and repeat vacuuming and running to waste two last things always bear in mind that cloudy pool water can be caused by multiple factors so make sure that one of these isn’t mechanical and make sure your filtration system is clean and operating efficiently and make sure that your pool has consistent and sufficient chlorination the lack of chlorine is always the first and biggest problem
