all my reviews thinking herself over her mothers suicide a teen finds herself involved in a deadly rampage through town of others who have also supposedly committed suicide and must stop the madman from striking more she loves frankly this was a truly wretched and utterly abysmal slasher effort that really has little discernible value what really undoes this one is the fact that theres just nothing at all that manages to be interesting here since the plot for this one is so predictable from the outset that sitting through this is just indeterminably boring and lifeless the film manages to telegraph everything with the subtlety of a sledgehammer through glass by announcing the killer and his rampage the second they appear onscreen no matter how much it wants to try to play up the use of multiple red herrings throughout the course of the film which in the end makes those scenes truly boring and lifeless likewise the fact that the film resorts to having everyone cry and whimper and moan about everything that happens here tends to cause this one just incredibly long stretches of time where nothing happens and its lowkey nature to everything around it causes numerous scenes to feel as if theyre not important or scary enough since it really has nothing special about it to make those scenes really scary or terrifying and thus become part of the general boredom surrounding this finally the killer itself here is just such a total joke that it really saps the rest of the life out of this one with a myriad of faults that pop up here the biggest issue is the cause for the rampage here which is just plain ridiculous and never once manages to feel logical or worthy of instigating a rampage due to the inherent lameness of the concept which is simply stupid on various levels beyond that the fact that this killer resorts to leaving vhs tapes of his crimes is quite lame as the ability to gloat over his crimes on an outdated source that he cant possibly be certain would be available for the couple to be able to view isnt all that suggestive of what hes capable of doing and really throws a lot of his scarefactor out the window as well the gimmick of turning everything into supposed suicides really strains credibility on the kills due to the enhanced amount of work that causes them to be overdone and quite clumsy causes them to feel contrived and setup rather than realistic and logical and overall these here hurt this film massively theres a few moments where this one does become something sort of watchable where it features a few tense stalking moments of her friends around town and the main sequence of the two having to elude detection at a suspects house in order to find evidence of his wrongdoing is far better than anything else in this film but otherwise thats all that works here rated r graphic violence graphic language nudity and a shadowy sex scene0 of 0 people found this review helpful was this review helpful to you yes no
