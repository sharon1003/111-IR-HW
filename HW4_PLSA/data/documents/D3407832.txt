space unanswered questions proxima b could we live on this newly found planet – or could something else the announcement that scientists think they may have found a planet orbiting the star nearest to our sun is potentially big news – even if it would take 70000 years to get there nicola davisnicola ksdavis sat 27 aug 2016 0300 edt1635 est551 527an artist’s impression of proxima b orbiting proxima centauri photograph esom kornmesserreuters discovery of potentially earthlike planet proxima b raises hopes for life read more what’s all the excitement about scientists have discovered a planet called proxima b orbiting the closest star to our sun – a red dwarf known as proxima centauri which lies 42 light years away what’s more there are clues that it could potentially have some similarities to earth does this mean we’ve found a second homealien civilisation no we don’t even know for sure that proxima b is a rocky planet although researchers think this is likely judging by other planets orbiting small stars what we do know is that it is within the socalled “habitable zone” meaning that if water is present on the planet it could be in liquid form but many important questions are as yet unanswered we don’t know if the planet has water or an atmosphere or a magnetic field to shield it from the highenergy radiation emitted by its star what is likely is that the newly discovered planet is “tidally locked” to its star meaning that only one side receives sunlight proxima b might be within the habitable zone but whether it could host life is quite a different matter how do we know it’s there astronomers have not seen the planet directly but have detected it from its influence on its star using instruments at the european southern observatory in chile while a star exerts a gravitational tug on a nearby planet the planet also exerts a smaller tug on the star meaning that the star “wobbles” a little as the planet travels around it this wobble can be spotted in the light emitted by the star – as the star moves towards us its light appears slightly bluer and as it moves away it appears redder by looking at the timing of this wobble scientists can work out how long it takes for the planet to orbit the star and its distance from the star while the mass of the planet affects just how big the wobble is in the case of proxima b the planet takes 112 days to travel around proxima centauri at a distance of around 75m km 45m miles from it – that’s about 5 of the distance between the earth and our sun the mass of the newly discovered planet is thought to be at least 13 times that of the earth how many other similar planets could be out there thousands of exoplanets – planets outside our solar system – have been found to date the first confirmed discoveries were in 1992 when astronomers found planets orbiting a type of neutron star known as a pulsar the first planet orbiting a sunlike star was discovered in 1995 since then missions such as the kepler space observatory as well as groundbased observations have found many more including a number of earthsized worlds within the habitable zone of their stars but that’s just the tip of the iceberg based on kepler’s results astronomers have suggested there could be as many as 40bn habitable earthsized planets in our galaxy travelling around red dwarfs or stars similar to our sun yellow dwarfs but with proxima centauri our nearest stellar neighbour none of these planets would be as close as proxima b when will we know more about it that depends that proxima b is relatively so close makes it an exciting prospect for scientists trying to probe the nature of other planets but there’s a hitch scientists are trying to figure out if it is possible to see proxima b pass across the face of its star – a process known as a transit if it does it will help to pin down many details of the planet’s makeup including its size atmosphere and density which will shed light on whether the planet is indeed rocky unfortunately the chances of being able to see such a transit are rather small but there are other ways of probing the proxima b using the european extremely large telescope which is currently under construction it might be possible to capture a direct image of the planet the james webb space telescope set to launch in 2018 might be able to shed light on whether or not the planet has an atmosphere and if it does what it is made of luminous beauty of jupiters auroras revealed by hubble telescope read more will anyone from earth ever get near it that’s unlikely to say the least using current technology it would take around 70000 years for a probe to reach the planet although emerging technology could halve that further ambitious projects such as yuri milner’s 100m breakthrough starshot initiative plan to create miniature space probes that would be propelled by light beams and travel at speeds of up to 100m mph meaning that it could reach proxima centauri within a matter of decades is the newly discovered planet part of a solar system like ours with a group of other planets we don’t yet know scientists say they have also spotted a second weaker signal but it is too early to say whether that could be another orbiting body do astrophysicists think there is life elsewhere in the universe most seem sanguine – but whether or not there is has been or ever will be life on proxima b remains a mystery for now at least topics space unanswered questions astronomy alien life seti search for extraterrestrial intelligence features reuse this contentmost viewed in
