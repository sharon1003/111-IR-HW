starting a one dollar bill collection the first step to starting your one dollar bill collection is to read all of the information on this site the second step is to decide what to collect you shouldnt worry too much about this decision because it is effortless to change your mind later building a collection united states currency has two features that lend themselves particularly well to systematic collecting first each note indicates the series of the note and second each note indicates the federal reserve bank at which it was printed see decoding a bill for more information since congress authorized the printing of 1 federal reserve notes in 1963 there have been 23 series issued with 12 different federal reserve banks there are more than 250 collectibly different notes in what we might consider the modern era not every series was printed by every bank thats a lot of notes although its technically possible to pursue the entire realm and try to accumulate one example of each note you might choose to start out by trying to find one example of each series or choose one series and try to find an issue from each bank of course there is no reason to limit yourself to the modern era the united states has been issuing one dollar bills since 1862 and the variety is amazing see history for more information although many pieces of old currency are extremely scarce a surprising number of notes from throughout the 20th century remain accessible and still occasionally turn up in circulation the red and blue seals and serial numbers and interesting inscriptions and obligations found on notes from the 1920s to 1950s make these items fascinating conversation pieces serial number collecting one very common collecting area for all types of us currency is the pursuit of fancy serial numbers the most often pursued of the fancy serial numbers are the very low ie 00000062 and the very high ie 99999302 its interesting to note here that even though low serial numbers are more popular high serial numbers are more rare because not every series reaches the high numbers star notes have a special serial number produced when notes are destroyed because of production errors star notes have an asterisk  before or after the serial number the purpose of the star note is to maintain the correct count of notes in a serial number run without reproducing the serial number other commonly pursued serial numbers are ladder  a sequence of ascending or descending digits  12345678 or 8765432solid and near solid  all or almost of the digits are the same  66666666 or 11111101repeater  a sequence of digits that repeats itself  12312312 or 34343434binary  consisting of only two digits in any combination  11333113 or 52222555birthday  part or all of a date embedded the number  19431111 or 09141941housing your collection after youve begun to accumulate a quantity of bills youll probably want develop a storage system that helps you organize and display your collection almost all collectors use some type of clear plastic sleeve that protects the note while allowing it to be easily examined from both sides there are essentially three variations on this theme first individual holders are available in various thickness that cover and protect the entire note these holders are then typically stored standing up in a box the box system is great for being flexible when you add remove or reorganize bills from your collection but not such a great way to display them also available are currency wallets and albums with the clear plastic sleeves builtin wallets and albums are great for display but tend to be a little more expensive and again reorganization can be tricky the third common option is something called a stock sheet which is essentially an album page designed for a generic threering binder the most important thing about using clear plastics to store your banknotes is to only use products designed for longterm archival storage of collectibles most common plastics contain a compound called pvc which deteriorates over time releasing acids and gases which will ruin notes the easiest way to ensure that your storage system is safe is to use products sold by currency stamp or coin dealers see the links page for a few ideas grading notes although this site encourages collecting paper money directly from circulation without much regard to condition you should be aware that many currency collectors are very concerned with the condition of a note over time collectors have developed a grading system which is an effective way to quickly describe condition although there is no absolute standard for grading terms and their meaning most collectors dealers price guides and organizations would adhere to something like the following crisp uncirculated unc or cu absolutely no sign of wear or handling no folds creases or bent corners about uncirculated au essentially in unc condition with a slight imperfection such as a counting fold on one corner or an uncreased bend in the center extremely fine ef or xf three light folds or one strong fold which breaks the surface paper is clean and bright with original sheen there may be slight rounding at the corners very fine vf may have several folds although the note is still crisp and has a minimum of dirt there may be minor tears or very small holes corners also show wear but not full rounding fine f a circulated note where a definite softening has occurred and individual folds and creases may no longer be visible no tears may extend into the printing this is grade should be considered about average for what you might find in circulation very good vg tears and small holes with no remaining crispness staining may have occurred no missing pieces good g fair and poor the continuum of shabby notes missing pieces writing on the note etc a worn out note
