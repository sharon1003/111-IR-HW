okay with all of us fans for a pair of djs who only recently started getting attention for their music they certainly know how to make things happen for themselves in just under 4 years these guys went from being undiscovered territory to the hottest duo in edm music while they worked their way up from house parties to real venues at colleges and nightclubs these guys managed to find their sound with some hard work and the right business strategy the chainsmokers have become a well known music making talent to be reckoned with but you already knew that too because you saw their mindblowing performance on the vmas last month that’s why you’re here you want to learn more about these guys well i’m happy to help here are some things that you might not know about your favorite music making team that only make them that much more endearing15 their real namesvia globaldanceelectroniccom advertising xandrew taggart and alex pall are the two members that make up the chainsmokers that’s right only two young men make up this dream team that seems to many people to have basically arrived over night but like most people in the music industry it wasn’t quite that easy these two may have made their success story happen a little faster than most but it wasn’t a walk in the park drew as he is more commonly known taggart is actually 26 years old while alex pall is 31 years old both guys met while they lived it up in new york city thanks to a mutual friendmanager they are just your normal average guys who enjoy music and turned it into a kickass profession i think that we all wish we were living their lives these two musically gifted young men didn’t grow up as best friends in fact they haven’t even known each other for that long but when you have it you know it and over the last few years it has become quite obvious to everyone that drew and alex were meant to work together14 they are quite smartvia wwwthechainsmokerscom advertising xi know that as a 24 year old right now i am not anywhere close to reaching my dream job so the fact that these guys who aren’t that much older than me have reached such unbelievable heights is inspirational to me this dynamic duo could be considered quite a gifted pair as far as musical prowess is concerned but they didn’t just happen to rise to success these guys have the brains to match their talent and therefore know that music is as much of a business as anything else i give both of them some major credit for paying attention to market trends and using them to their advantage these two didn’t just accidentally fall into a career that blew up over night they truly look at what their audience is lacking or enjoying and aim to fulfill audience needs these guys are true artists in their own right13 they went to different collegesvia celebmixcom advertising xthere is just something about the way that these guys act on a regular basis that makes you think that the chainsmokers had to have been fraternity brothers in college however that is not the case they actually didn’t know each other when they attended college to begin with going back to the beginning of this article drew and alex aren’t the same age therefore they actually didn’t even go to college at the same time regardless of what year they each attended school they actually had different tastes when it came down to their ideal universities alex went to new york university while drew went to syracuse both new york schools have solid credentials but they are pretty different as far as campus life and their locations it seems that drew and alex both enjoyed their specific college experiences but they sure do like to drink like college buddies these days12 they made selfie happenvia wwwiheartcom thats right the same producersdj duo that is killing the charts with closer burst onto the scene with a song about selfies and everyone loved it please complete the following statement “but first let me ” you know how that ends don’t hate on the selfie makers for bringing a new wave of selfobsessed millennial because they were just capitalizing on an already growing fad in america honestly they don’t even want to remember this popular single but there’s no reason to consider the song anything other than a genius marketing move and easy to promote single they all do it but the chainsmokers just did it better while they have matured their sound and style since the release of this single it is important to note that it brought them their first initial taste of fame and recognition never forget where you came from guys even if you started with a selfie youre here now11 they have only known each other since 2012via wwwyoutubecom advertising xso not only did drew and alex attend different colleges but they also started their music careers totally separately until 2012 they were both doing their own thing trying to get paid to play music their new dream all became possible when a mutual acquaintance of theirs pitched an idea to connect the two of them professionally he convinced them to grab dinner and the rest was history here we are 4 years later and they spend almost every day playing music or just hanging out together talk about a great match i mean there are people that i’ve known for 3 or 4 years that i enjoy spending time with but i’m not sure that i could work professionally with someone and also be their best friend however that’s how alex and drew do it they use their friendship as the foundation to great music making since it helps keep a kind of musical chemistry to their work10 both recently bought houses in lavia lonelyplanetcom starting off as east coast residents both alex and drew have newly purchased homes in los angeles dont worry while they are very close they did buy separate houses supposedly the move was at least partially inspired by their desire to be closer to las vegas they go to and from las vegas so often that cutting down their travel time seemed like the best move either way these two are now officially west coast residents so keep an eye out for their legendary parties because they will be throwing them and who wouldn’t want to take a tequila shot with the chainsmokers you might not want to be either of their neighbors but you have to admit that the idea of a chainsmokers house party sounds pretty awesome maybe one day their homes will be locations for star sighting tours but for now i hope these young men take full advantage of living it up in los angeles9 they love the ladiesvia headlineplanetcom while it is my understanding that the chainsmoker duo both have girlfriends it is no secret that both drew and alex love the ladies if you find the time to watch their snapchats or instagrams then it is very evident that along with drinking and music women are one of their favorite past times your average 2530 year old man might be able to control their girl crazy desires but as far as being an up and coming music artists they are just getting started it doesnt take a genius to guess that theyre getting a fair amount of attention from their female fans just go to a show and see the incredible attention that they command the women tend to be quite outspoken and nobody hears the chainsmokers requests for it to stop theres no reason to avoid the fun because the women come with the territory and the chainsmokers just love to cash in featured today15 new celeb romances that we were not expecting in 201820 things you didnt know about disney princesses 22matt damon hilariously deflects blame for ben afflecks tattoo advertising x8 they love greece according to their recent teen vogue interview the chainsmokers have been jet setting all over the world but their favorite place that they’ve visited recently was mykonos greece i don’t think that anyone could blame them for picking greece as their favorite location though because it sounds amazing i’m sure that the duo has had their fair share of traveling over the last year so for them to say that mykonos greece stood out for them that’s impressive it sounds like their visit to greece was for a mini vacation as opposed to a show which might have lent itself to why they liked it the most it’s hard to compete against a vacation but hopefully the chainsmokers are able to enjoy everywhere that they’re going because i don’t see them slowing down any time soon it’s hard to even imagine what touring must be like for these two but all i know is that they seem to enjoy every new location with a bottle of alcohol and their music nearby naturally it sounds like one hell of an experience7 dog is a mans best friend minus your bandmatevia pinterestcom advertising xboth alex and drew own dogs much to their snapchat followers delight cheddar and louie are by far two of the most lovable pups to ever grace social media if you havent experienced a cheddar pup snap then you need to go check it out right now i will wait…see i told you is there anything more precious than talented music producersdjs who have adorable puppies to take naps with i don’t think so personally besides i am currently living vicariously through them because i don’t have a dog at the moment and it’s a problem i love cheddar and louie almost as though they are my own i think that’s normal…okay maybe not but whatever the point is that the chainsmokers are successful talented musical geniuses but the fact that they have dogs makes them that much more likable they are just living life to the fullest and you can’t blame them for taking advantage of the lives that they’ve been able to build6 a halsey collaboration was bound to happenvia wwwmetrolyricscom as it turns out the chainsmokers had been hoping to do a vocal collaboration with halsey long before closer was created closer was well worth the hype in my opinion because nobody can deny the fact that halsey has an amazing voice pairing her voice with the debut vocals of drew and a great beat was a perfect match whats interesting though is that the chainsmokers avidly admit that in multiple interviews in the past they have listed halsey as the person that they would most like to work with at some point in the future well boys it looks like you made an impression on her since youre only a few years into your careers and already working with your dream vocalists i think i speak for everyone when i say keep reaching for the stars because we cant wait to hear some more major collaborations with the phoebe ryan collaboration that came out this past week  all we know  fans are always going to be on their toes waiting for the next big single from our favorite dj duo5 they have combined and individual social media accountsvia promotionmusicnewscom in a society where social media is an industry of its own being a celebrity has taken on a new dynamic its not just enough to be great djsproducers you have to keep fans happy with constant content on snapchat instagram twitter etc so its actually interesting that the chainsmokers have a the chainsmokers account for snapchat instagram twitter but also have their own individual accounts as you can imagine their official chainsmokers accounts have the most followers with their instagram obtaining 13 million followers which makes sense though because they certainly keep the content coming with many of their videos shot by rory kramer these guys constantly provide video clips of their tours for fans to enjoy their individual instagrams are naturally more tailored to them individually but everything comes back to the music get to know these guys via their social media outlets and youll be entertained for days by their crazy antics and lovable pets4 they aspire to keep audiences guessing advertising xas far as what the chainsmokers hope to accomplish with their career it all stems from the fact that they want to keep their audiences guessing about what is coming next every musician wants to have a bit of brand recognition with regards to their fans and their new tracks you have to be new sounds but it is important for audiences to be able to recognize your specific style so that you don’t blend in with the other artists putting out music these days the chainsmokers don’t really need to worry about standing out because their music speaks for itself but they know that it is important to keep fans excited about new releases they believe the best way to accomplish this excitement is to try new things ie putting drew’s vocals on a new song i wonder what other surprises we can expect from these guys…whatever it will be we will be ready3 there’s an album coming maybe…via wwwyouredmcom well the chainsmokers like to mess around during all of their interviews which comes as no surprise i’m sure but it’s very hard to distinguish between the jokes and the serious comments in my opinion based on their recent teen vogue interview it sounds like they are working towards an album they just aren’t ready to call it an album yet that’s understandable sometimes the direction a musician’s album takes doesn’t form until the last few songs come together all i know is that the chainsmokers’ fans are more than ready for a full album to be release according to the chainsmokers they are waiting for the demand to be there so it’s time to get working boys we will patiently await the album but let’s not wait too much longer ok we are eager to hear some new tunes in the meantime please continue to keep dropping new singles thanks2 they use touring as inspiration for their songsvia www eonlinecom when teen vogue asked the pair of men how they handle the hardship of touring they were quite humble about it all with their girlfriends dogs and new homes to get back to these two guys seem to be doing just fine but they miss home naturally and they mentioned that the fact that they have to deal with being homesick is worth the hassle since they actually like to take stories memories and feelings from being on tour and turn them into inspiration for their songs so as a fan let me just say that they need to keep touring because their songs are only getting better and better i mean they just dropped a new single all we know which just makes you want to go back to your hometown grab a bottle of whiskey and see old friends or maybe that’s just me but honestly you need to check it out if you haven’t yet1 never call them predictablevia profoundcocom the chainsmokers are anything but ordinary and as they like to point out they want to keep things exciting watching their excursions on tour via snapchat it’s clear that they just enjoy having a good time and keeping things light and fun it’s evident that the chainsmokers are far from done making hit singles and with the hopeful album in the future we can expect the unexpected from this pair of musical genius i highly recommend checking them out on social media because they bring the good times and you won’t be disappointed by their entertaining words of wisdom or random occurrences of jumping off of high surfaces so don’t even think about them getting complacent and just riding their past successes because that couldn’t be further from the reality just go enjoy their new single and keep in mind the fact that they warned everybody that they’re going to keep us all guessing and we wouldn’t want it to be any other way give the richest a
