kjeldahl nitrogen kjeldahl analysis is definitely the most common method for performing nitrogen and protein determination for diversified applications nitrogen determination has a long history in the area of analytical chemistry johan kjeldahl first introduced the kjeldahl method in 1883 at a meeting of the danish chemical society kjeldahl at that time carlsberg laboratory manager was assigned to scientifically observe the processes involved in beer production while studying proteins during malt production he developed a method of determining nitrogen content that was faster and more accurate than any method available at the time johan kjeldahl working at carlsberg laboratory in the 1880s kjeldahl analysis is extremely versatile as it can handle a very wide range of samples from food  feed grain meat fish milk dairy fruit vegetables beverages environmental agriculture oilseeds soil fertilizers water wastewater sludge to chemical and pharmaceutical industries paper textiles rubber plastic polymer total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn is the sum of organic nitrogen ammonia nh3 and ammonium nh4 in the chemical analysis of soil water and wastewater to calculate total nitrogen tn the concentrations of nitraten and nitriten are determined and added to the total kjeldahl nitrogen today total kjeldahl nitrogen is a required parameter for regulatory reporting at many treatment plants total kjeldahl nitrogen is often used as a surrogate for protein in food samples the conversion from tkn to protein depends on the type of protein present in the sample and what fraction of the protein is composed of nitrogenous amino acids however the range of conversion factors is relatively narrow example conversion factors known as n factors for foods range from 638 for dairy and 625 for meat eggs and maize corn to 570 for wheat flour and 546 for peanuts in most cases the key to a successful kjeldahl analysis can be the sample preparation step before digestion phase this method might not be the fastest method to use but thanks to the high reliability will always give satisfactory results if performed correctly and following standards the kjeldahl analysis may be broken down into three main steps digestion  the decomposition of nitrogen in organic samples utilizing a concentrated acid solution this is accomplished by boiling a homogeneous sample in concentrated sulfuric acid the end result is an ammonium sulfate solution distillation  adding excess base to the acid digestion mixture to convert nh4 to nh3 followed by boiling and condensation of the nh3 gas in a receiving solution titration  to quantify the amount of ammonia in the receiving solution the amount of nitrogen in a sample can be calculated from the quantified amount of ammonia ions in the receiving solution today various scientific associations approve the kjeldahl method including the aoac international association of official analytical chemists aacc association of american cereal chemists aocs american oil chemists society epa environmental protection agency iso international standards organization and many others all velp scientifica equipment for kjeldahl nitrogen determination work in accordance with the abovementioned associations kjeldahl nitrogen  modern velp scientifica solutions for digestion kjeldahl nitrogen  modern velp scientifica solutions for distillation and titration
