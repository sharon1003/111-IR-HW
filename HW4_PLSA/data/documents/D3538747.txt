australiav t e a drawing of the ramsey cartransfer apparatus from the patent application bogie exchange is a system for operating railway wagons on two or more gauges to overcome difference in the track gauge to perform a bogie exchange a car is converted from one gauge to another by removing the bogies or trucks the chassis containing the wheels and axles of the car and installing a new bogie with differently spaced wheels it is generally limited to wagons and carriages though diesel locomotives can be exchanged if enough time is available bogies exchange operation in ussuriisk near

them off one set of bogies and putting them back down again on another set of bogies the pin that centres the bogies and the hoses and fittings for the brakes must be compatible a generous supply of bogies of each gauge is needed to accommodate the ebb and flow of traffic the bogies and wagons also need to have standardized hooks etc where they may be efficiently lifted the two wheel sets on fourwheel wagons can be changed as well if the wagon has been designed accordingly engines  editsteam  editsteam engines can be designed for more than one gauge by having for example reversible wheel hubs that suit two alternative gauges this was done in the 1930s and beyond in victoria for possible gauge conversion though no engines were ever converted in this manner other than one heritage engine  r766  some 1000 mm  3 ft 3 3⁄ 8in metre gauge garratt locomotives of east africa were designed for easy conversion to 3 ft 6 in  1067 mm gauge though again none ever was in 1944 the lms

ireland redesignated as class y they largely undertook shunting work on dockyard lines in belfast the regauging was performed by simply reversing the wheel centres so that the spokes dished outwards in the southern united states some steam locomotives built by baldwin were designed for easy conversion from 5 ft  1524 mm to 4 ft 8 1⁄ 2in  1435 mm standard gauge diesel  editdiesel locomotives have bogies like wagons and carriages only with more cables for the traction motors and take a little longer to convert in australia some classes of diesel locomotives are regularly gaugeconverted

other being separated by deserts or lines of other gauges they are bogieexchanged or piggybacked on road or rail vehicles when transferred between these networks raising or lowering  editraise  editthe simplest way to carry out bogie exchange is to lift the wagons off the bogies and replace them back on new bogies this may require the wagons in a train to be uncoupled and continuous brakes disconnected as the bogies are swung out of the way they sway which wastes time settling them down lower  editanother way of carrying out bogie exchange is to lower the bogies onto a trolley in a pit after which the trolleys are rolled out of the way and others return this keeps the train couplings and continuous brakes connected in addition the bogies never need leave a solid surface so they can be wheeled in and out more quickly this method was used at dry creek railway station adelaide 1international  editaustralia  editbetween 1961 and 1995 australia had five bogie exchange centres which opened and closed as gauge conversion work proceeded the gauges served were 1435 mm  4 ft 8 1⁄ 2in and 1600 mm  5 ft 3 in  though the 1067 mm  3 ft 6 in queensland did acquire 100 bogieexchange
