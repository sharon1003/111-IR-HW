background in the years before the civil war the lives of american women were shaped by a set of ideals that historians call “the cult of true womanhood” as men’s work moved away from the home and into shops offices and factories the household became a new kind of place a private feminized domestic sphere a “haven in a heartless world” “true women” devoted their lives to creating a clean comfortable nurturing home for their husbands and children did you know more than 400 women disguised themselves as men and fought in the union and confederate armies during the civil war during the civil war however american women turned their attention to the world outside the home thousands of women in the north and south joined volunteer brigades and signed up to work as nurses it was the first time in american history that women played a significant role in a war effort by the end of the war these experiences had expanded many americans’ definitions of “true womanhood”fighting for the union with the outbreak of war in 1861 women and men alike eagerly volunteered to fight for the cause in the northern states women organized ladies’ aid societies to supply the union troops with everything they needed from food they baked and canned and planted fruit and vegetable gardens for the soldiers to clothing they sewed and laundered uniforms knitted socks and gloves mended blankets and embroidered quilts and pillowcases to cash they organized doortodoor fundraising campaigns county fairs and performances of all kinds to raise money for medical supplies and other necessities but many women wanted to take a more active role in the war effort inspired by the work of florence nightingale and her fellow nurses in the crimean war they tried to find a way to work on the front lines caring for sick and injured soldiers and keeping the rest of the union troops healthy and safe in june 1861 they succeeded the federal government agreed to create “a preventive hygienic and sanitary service for the benefit of the army” called the united states sanitary commission the sanitary commission’s primary objective was to combat preventable diseases and infections by improving conditions particularly “bad cookery” and bad hygiene in army camps and hospitals it also worked to provide relief to sick and wounded soldiers by war’s end the sanitary commission had provided almost 15 million in supplies–the vast majority of which had been collected by women–to the union army nearly 20000 women worked more directly for the union war effort workingclass white women and free and enslaved africanamerican women worked as laundresses cooks and “matrons” and some 3000 middleclass white women worked as nurses the activist dorothea dix the superintendent of army nurses put out a call for responsible maternal volunteers who would not distract the troops or behave in unseemly or unfeminine ways dix insisted that her nurses be “past 30 years of age healthy plain almost to repulsion in dress and devoid of personal attractions” one of the most famous of these union nurses was the writer louisa may alcott army nurses traveled from hospital to hospital providing “humane and efficient care for wounded sick and dying soldiers” they also acted as mothers and housekeepers–“havens in a heartless world”–for the soldiers under their care women of the confederacy white women in the south threw themselves into the war effort with the same zeal as their northern counterparts the confederacy had less money and fewer resources than did the union however so they did much of their work on their own or through local auxiliaries and relief societies they too cooked and sewed for their boys they provided uniforms blankets sandbags and other supplies for entire regiments they wrote letters to soldiers and worked as untrained nurses in makeshift hospitals they even cared for wounded soldiers in their homes many southern women especially wealthy ones relied on slaves for everything and had never had to do much work however even they were forced by the exigencies of wartime to expand their definitions of “proper” female behavior slaves and freedwomen slave women were of course not free to contribute to the union cause moreover they had never had the luxury of “true womanhood” to begin with as one historian pointed out “being a women never saved a single female slave from hard labor beatings rape family separation and death” the civil war promised freedom but it also added to these women’s burden in addition to their own plantation and household labor many slave women had to do the work of their husbands and partners too the confederate army frequently impressed male slaves and slaveowners fleeing from union troops often took their valuable male slaves but not women and children with them workingclass white women had a similar experience while their husbands fathers and brothers fought in the army they were left to provide for their families on their own a women’s proper place during the civil war women especially faced a host of new duties and responsibilities for the most part these new roles applied the ideals of victorian domesticity to “useful and patriotic ends” however these wartime contributions did help expand many women’s ideas about what their “proper place” should be access hundreds of hours of historical video commercial free with
