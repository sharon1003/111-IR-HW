this article is about the specific use in genomics for the general phenomenon see nucleic acid thermodynamics § hybridization dna–dna hybridization generally refers to a molecular biology technique that measures the degree of genetic similarity between pools of dna sequences it is usually used to determine the genetic distance between two organisms this has been used extensively in phylogeny and taxonomy contents  hide 1 method2 use in zoology3 use in microbiology4 replacement by genome sequencing5 see also6 references method  editthe dna of one organism is labeled then mixed with the unlabeled dna to be compared against the mixture is incubated to allow dna strands to dissociate and renewal forming hybrid doublestranded dna hybridized sequences with a high degree of similarity will bind more firmly and require more energy to separate them ie they separate when heated at a higher temperature than dissimilar sequences a process known as  dna melting  to assess the melting profile of the hybridized dna the doublestranded dna is bound to a column and the mixture is heated in small steps at each step the column is washed sequences that melt become singlestranded and wash off the column the temperatures at which labeled dna comes off the column reflects the amount of similarity between sequences and the selfhybridization sample serves as a control these results are combined to determine the degree of genetic similarity between organisms use in zoology  editwhen several species are compared that way the similarity values allow the species to be arranged in a phylogenetic tree it is therefore one possible approach to carrying out molecular systematics charles sibley and jon ahlquist pioneers of the technique used dna–dna hybridization to examine the phylogenetic relationships of avians the sibley–ahlquist taxonomy and primates 1 2use in microbiology  editdna–dna hybridization is the gold standard to distinguish bacterial species with a similarity value greater than 70 indicating that the compared strains belong to distinct species 3 4 5 in 2014 a threshold of 79 similarity has been suggested to separate bacterial subspecies 6replacement by genome sequencing  editcritics argue that the technique is inaccurate for comparison of closely related species as any attempt to measure differences between orthologous sequences between organisms is overwhelmed by the hybridization of paralogous sequences within an organisms genome 7 dna sequencing and computational comparisons of sequences is now generally the method for determining genetic distance although the technique is still used in microbiology to help identify bacteria 8the modern approach is to carry out dna–dna hybridization in silico using completely or partially sequenced genomes 9 the ggdc developed at dsmz is the most accurate known tool for calculating ddhanalogous values 9 among other algorithmic improvements it solves the problem with paralogous sequences by carefully filtering them from the matches between the two genome sequences see also  editdna melting temperature gradient gel electrophoresis references  edit genetic similarities wilson sarich sibley
