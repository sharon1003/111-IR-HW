table of contents routes to mount frissell from the east the standard route jeep road from mount washington road over bear mountain loop over alander mountain from the west south taconic trail from the south summary of distances and elevation gains mount frissell in winter directions to trailheads trailheads on mt washington road from massachusetts from connecticut undermountain trail south taconic trail resources books maps online resources while bear mountain elevation 2316 feet is the highest summit in connecticut the highest point in that state elevation 2380 feet is on the south slope of mount frissell along the mount frissell trail a little to the west of the summit elevation 2653 feet most highpointers reach it by a rather short route starting high up in the col between mt frissell and bear mountain at an elevation of around 1800 feet while planning a trip to the ct highpoint i decided to look for more interesting ways of reaching that point this trip eventually became a four day highpointing expedition in the berkshires county highpointers may want to attempt to reach the two nearby new york county highpoints dutchess county the summit of brace mountain and columbia county on massachusetts state line 03 mile west of alander mountain the resources section has information on maps of the region for those who do not have a paper map i am including a topozone map of the area routes to mount frissell i have not attempted to list all possible routes to mount frissell just those that i think a highpointer is most likely to use many other routes can be put together using any of the maps in the resources section since most highpointers do not hike as part of a large group i have not described any routes which require a car spot from the east a high valley separates the south taconic range from the bear mountainmount everett range to its east three trailheads all at elevations of over 1600 feet lie on a road in that valley more ambitious hikers can start east of the bear mountain climbing over it descending to the valley and then ascending mt frissell the standard route i am including this for completeness it is well described in all highpointing books the trail starts on the massachusetts side of the border with connecticut on a road called east street in ma and mount washington road in ct it first goes over round mountain open summit good views climbing very steeply after round mountain the trail descends to a col then climbs very steeply again to the summit of mount frissell the summit itself is wooded but there are good views on the eastern ledges from the summit it is a short distance to the highpoint on the boundary passing the south ledges with good views the tristate point ma ct and ny is a bit further along the same trail the round trip distance to the highpoint is 26 miles with roughly 1000 feet of total elevation gain this gives a book time of 150 note that there are two sections on this short trail that the massachusetts and rhode island trail guide see books below describes as very steep a friend has used the word climbing to describe those two sections jeep road from mount washington road this easier approach uses an old jeep road called the brace mountain trail in the massachusetts and rhode island trail guide that starts from the mount washington road about 12 miles south of the state border it climbs part way up brace mountain and meets first the southern end of the ashley hill trail and shortly after the south taconic trail turn right north on either of these to reach the mt frissell trail west of the tristate point follow that trail eastward passing the tristate point and the connecticut highpoint before ascending to the summit of mt frissell round trip distance is 34 miles with an elevation gain of about 600 feet for a book time of 200 county highpointers will want to go south for a short distance on the south taconic trail to get to the summit of brace mountain the highpoint of dutchess county others may want to reach it for the excellent views these two routes can be combined to make a loop which will include a road walk of 12 miles over bear mountain this route takes you over the highest summit in connecticut on the way to the states highpoint take the undermountain trail off ct 41 north of salisbury to its junction with the at go north right on the at over bear mt and down the steep north side from the top you go about ¾ mile down very steeply and as soon as the trail flattens out there is an unmarked trail to the left if you get to the junction with paradise lane and signs to sages ravine youve gone too far follow this trail for about 08 miles to the mt washington road almost across the road from the start of the mt frissell trail follow that trail over round mountain and the summit of mount frissell to the connecticut highpoint round trip distance is 96 miles with an elevation gain of 3000 feet book time is 615 this may be turned into a loop by using the paradise lane trail to bypass the summit of bear mountain in one direction the distance is unchanged but there are 500 fewer feet of elevation gain for a book time of 600 loop over alander mountain a scenic loop over alander mountain starts at the mt washington state forest headquarters on east street in the town of mt washington massachusetts take the mount alander trail to the summit of mount alander there are two choices from the summit you may go down by the south taconic trail going over the highpoint of columbia county ny or you may take the alander loop trail which joins the south taconic trail in either case follow the south taconic trail to its junction with the mt frissell trail and take that trail eastwards passing the tristate marker and connecticut highpoint on the way to the summit of mount frissell return by following the mt frissell trail back west slightly beyond the tristate marker then take the ashley hill trail north to join the alander mountain trail a short distance from the trailhead round trip distance is 112 miles with 1600 feet of elevation gain book time is 625 it is obviously possible to add brace mountain to this loop before heading east on the mount frissell trail follow the taconic crest trail south for 05 mile to the summit of brace mountain then return to the mount frissell trail there is minimal elevation gain so add 030 to book time from the west south taconic trail from the south this starts at the rudd pond farms residential development in new york state the south taconic trail starts gently going eastwards along the side of a field it soon starts to climb steeply over very rough terrain and there are some scrambles up ledges that i found unpleasantly exposed your tolerance for exposure may well be greater than mine reaching the ridge it goes north over brace mountain highpoint of dutchess county ny to its junction with the mt frissell trail that trail passes by the tristate point then the highpoint of ct and then climbs to the summit on an open slope with great views the round trip distance to the summit of mount frissell is 66 miles with about 1500 feet of elevation gain book time is 400 this is the route that i used to do mount frissell and brace mountain in the spring of 2003 summary of distances and elevation gains to summarize here are the distances elevation gains and book times of the various possible routes to mount frissell routes to mount frissell route distance elevation gain book time mt frissell trail from east 26 1000 150jeep road 34 600 200over bear mountain

easy highpoint largely because of the short but steep standard route many are unpleasantly surprised when they attempt it in winter the connecticut access to the standard route is closed in winter and the route itself can be tricky with the steep rocky climbs covered with snow before attempting the trip read the trip reports by dick mc and markv directions to trailheads the undermountain trail starts on a state road well shown on all maps all the others start on more obscure roads trailheads on mt washington road the alander mountain trail the mount frissell trail and the jeep road all start on the mt washington road a portion of which is called the east street from massachusetts follow rt 2341 through south egremont where rt 41 branches off to the right south almost immediate the mount washington road clearly signed branches off to the right after 8 miles a road branches off to the right going to bish bash falls and copake falls again clearly signed continue straight ahead past it after about a mile the mt washington state forest headquarters is reached it has a large parking lot and is the trailhead for the alander mountain trail the mount frissell trailhead is further south my guess from the map is about 2½ miles just beyond the state line the jeep road starts about 12 miles south of the state border from connecticut note this road is unplowed and closed in winter take factory street also known as washinee street about 01 miles south of the junction of rts 41 and 44 in salisbury after about half a mile bear left on the mount riga road following it for about three miles then turn right onto the mount washington road follow that road for 33 miles to the state line for the mount frissell trail or 21 miles to the jeep road undermountain trail the trailhead is on the west side of ct 41 about 35 miles north of salisbury south taconic trail drive on ny 22 either 55 miles north of the traffic light in millerton or 75 miles south from the intersection with rt 344 to copake falls then go east on white house crossing street and drive to its end here take a left on rudd pond road and after 03 miles take a right onto deer run road into a residential development rudd farms take a left on to quarry hill road and follow it to a small parking area at the edge of the woods resources i have made no effort to produce a comprehensive list of resources
