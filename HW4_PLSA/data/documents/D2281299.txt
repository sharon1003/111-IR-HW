ingredients soap we like to be clean clean feels good it smells good clean means fewer microbes are around to hurt us clean clothes feel good clean dishes make food safer and more attractive for thousands of years soap was the last word in clean soap the first soaps were probably the saps of certain plants such as the soap plant  chlorogalum pomeridianum  whose roots can be crushed in water to form a lather and used as a shampoo other plants such as soapbark  quillaja saponaria  soapberry  sapindus mukorossi  and soapwort  saponaria officinalis also contain the same main ingredient a compound called saponin which forms the foamy lather and is also a toxin used to stupefy fish in streams to make them easy to catch later people learned that fats would react with alkalies in the ashes left over from a fire to produce saponified compounds such as sodium stearate and the related potassium stearate  today soaps are made from fats and oils that react with lye  sodium hydroxide  solid fats like coconut oil palm oil tallow rendered beef fat or lard rendered pork fat are used to form bars of soap that stay hard and resist dissolving in the water left in the soap dish oils such as olive oil soybean oil or canola oil make softer soaps castile soap is any soap that is made primarily of olive oil and is known for being mild and soft as warm liquid fats react with lye and begin to saponify they start to thicken like pudding at this point dyes and perfumes are often added the hardening liquid is then poured into molds where it continues to react generating heat after a day the bars can be cut and wrapped but the saponification process continues for a few weeks until all of the lye has reacted with the oils soaps are often superfatted so after all of the lye has reacted with the fats there are still fats left over this is important for two reasons first the resulting soap is easier to cut and feels smoother on the skin second the extra fats make sure that all of the lye reacts so no lye is left to irritate the skin and the resulting soap is not too alkaline the saponification process results in about 75 soap and 25 glycerine in homemade soaps the glycerine is left in as it acts as an emollient skin softener and adds a nice feel to the soap in commercial soaps the glycerine is often removed and sold separately sometimes showing up in skin moisturizers that remedy the damage done by drying soaps commercial bar soaps contain sodium tallowate  sodium cocoate sodium palmate and similar ingredients all of which are the results of reacting solid fats tallow coconut oil and palm kernel oil respectively with lye to these ingredients they add fatty acids such as coconut acid and palm acid the fats in coconut oil and palm kernel oil as the extra fats needed to ensure the lye is completely reacted and the soap has a good feel polyethylene glycols such as peg6 methyl ether may be added as either surfactants detergents emulsifiers to make the dyes and perfumes blend evenly or as thickeners glycerine is added as an emollient and texture enhancer sorbitol is another emollient used along with glycerine it is often added to help make glycerine soaps more transparent titanium dioxide is added to make the soap opaque pentasodium pentetate  tetrasodium etidronate and tetrasodium edta are added as water softeners and to protect the dyes and perfumes from the effects of metal ions in the mixtures these compounds lock up calcium and magnesium in the water preventing them from reacting with the soap to form insoluble soap scum detergent bars not all bars that lather contain just soap many contain the same detergents that you find in shampoo along with soap in addition to the soaps and fatty acids some bars will contain cocamidopropyl betaine a mild amphoteric detergent added to decrease irritation without decreasing suds or cleaning power and benzine sulfonate detergents such as sodium dodecylbenzinesulfonate other detergents such as sodium isethionate and sodium cocoyl isethionate are also common preservatives bht butylated hydroxytoluene is sometimes added as an antioxidant preservative to keep the oils from going rancid anti microbials antibacterial soaps usually contain triclosan or triclocarban as the active antibacterial ingredient by simon quellen field follow me on googlefind us on google
