resin replacement  when why and how when or why to replace your softening resins first let me say that is has been my experience that the resins in your water softener will usually out last the control valve examination of resin tanks over 20 years old found the resins to still be capable of the ion exchange  which is the process by which your water is softened  some depletion of the amount of resin occurred in some of the systems over 20 years old and modern day resin has improved slightly but replacement is not needed as often as some would lead you to believe  how much resins should be in the tank tanks 44 and taller normally are only 55  60 full when new some shorter tanks  40 and shorter  may be as much as 80 full  note  the valve head must have an upper distributor screen or basket installed to use this higher percentage of resins   when should you replace your resins1 the number one reason to replace your resins is because they have been damaged by years of exposure to chlorinated city water after about 10 years  can be much sooner or a bit later  the resins swell and then they break down they become so fragmented the fines collecting at the bottom distributor start to restrict the water pressure through the resin tank this is generally how you know you need new resins on some systems the fragments  fines  will start coming into the house and clogging faucet screens if resin fragments have been getting into your house then you will also need to replace the bottom distributor  use our pn md1236 listed below  your resins look like this  color many vary  2 when the resin bed has become contaminated by a noticeable and usually visible amount of algae growth  this problem is common in tanks installed outside 3 when the resin tank has a large amount of fine sand in it this sometimes happens on well water it is always recommended to have a sediment prefilter installed in the water line before your water softener this fine sand in the resin bed will cause you to have very poor water pressure the only way to solve the problem is to dump  or suck  out all the resins and sand replacing with new resins is a whole lot easier than trying to sift the sand out of your old resin4 when a resin tank has been sitting unused for months or years and a strong odor is detected from the resins you can try cleaning with a weak chlorine solution but odds are you will need to dump the resins bleach out the tank  with a strong chlorine solution  and start with fresh new resins5 resins fouled by iron and organics can usually be cleaned by adding a heavy dose of resin cleaner  such as res up iron out citric acid or bleach  of course replacing with new works every time how to replace your resins1 turn off water unplug control valve from electric outlet disconnect control valve from water lines drain line and brine line 2 unscrew control valve  may require two people  3 remove control valve and distributor tube  the two normally can be separated at the control valve  4 now the fun part depending on your situation  size and location of your tank  you need to either dump the water and resins out or use suction to remove them  when its not possible to lay the tank down and dump a shop vacuum is the next best way to remove the resins from the tank the resins are a nontoxic plastic and can be throw away or spread out in your lawn or flower bed if you live in an area that has some law about disposal please dont break the law i am currently unaware of any restrictions but now a days the local governments are getting creative in passing laws to protect the public 5 you can clean the inside of the tank with chlorine  bleach  if you feel it needs it if you need to scrub the inside of the tank use a clean toilet bowl brush with piece of pipe to extend the handle and if you are going to be replacing your bottom distributor and center pipe this would be the time to do it  when the tank is empty  6 the next step is to pour in the new resins a funnel is needed a second person to help the resins flow into the tank is always nice to have but one person can do it by themselves  slowly  if your resin tanks diameter is over 12 it is recommended that you pour a 46 inch layer of fine gravel  18 x 14  into the tank before the resins on tanks 12 or less in diameter the gravel under bedding is usually an unneeded option if gravel under bedding is used you must have the distributor tube in the tank before you start filling with gravel be sure you cover the top opening of your distributor tube to prevent any gravel or resins from getting inside a plastic sandwich bag and rubber band works well  to be more specific  as this step has been confusing to some customers   normally easiest to fill tank first  before inserting your riser pipe  using the main opening at top of tank and a large funnel and with just resin  no gravel  being added to the tank you can leave the center riser  distributor pipe out while filling then add a few gallons of water  with hose or bucket or other container  until the resin is completely covered in water  50  60  of tank height normally  and then you should be able to push the distributor pipe down through the new resin to the bottom of the tank then mount  screw on the control valve only when you have gravel being added first is it necessary to have the distributor pipe inside before filling and in those cases you would cover the top of pipe opening and carefully pour around the pipe  with large funnel  to fill the tank with media then you can mount  screw on the valve without adding any water  manually with hose or bucket  note we do not recommend gravel for residential water softeners with tank diameters under 13 inches why not gravel 7 and lastly you are going to do the steps 321 in reverse 8 once reassembled you should backwash your new resins for 10 minutes using your control valve  all control valves have some way to manually advance the valve to backwash  you can allow the valve to run a complete regeneration cycle but it is not needed the resins come fully charged 9 with the control valve in the normal service position run the water in the home for a few minutes to clear the lines of any trapped air 10  youre done how much resins to use tank size amount of resins gravel underbedding8 x 35 064 cu ft none8 x 44 075 cu ft none9 x 35 075 cu ft none9 x 40 100 cu ft
