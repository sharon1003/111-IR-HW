was a bit crowded any sane person would have left long ago but i cannot i have my sons id like to be a queen in peoples hearts but i dont see myself being queen of this country my role is about 80 slog and 20 fantastic if im going to comfort the suffering i have to understand what theyve been through describing her relationship with the press wherever i go it waits for me and it tracks me down whatever i do whatever i say it will always look for controversy and contradiction it will always criticize me my father always taught me to treat everybody as an equal i have always done and i am sure that  prince william and prince harry are the same i was always told by my family that i was the thick one that i was stupid and my brother was the clever one and i was always so conscious of that i used to go to the head mistress crying saying i wish i wasnt so stupid 1993 when i started my public life 12 years ago i understood the media might be interested in what i did i realized then their attention would inevitably focus on both our private and public lives but i was not aware of how overwhelming that attention would become nor the extent to which it would affect both my public duties and my personal life in a manner thats been hard to bear at the end of this year when ive completed my diary of official engagements i will be reducing the extent of the public life ive lead so far she wont go quietly thats the problem ill fight to the end because i believe that i have a role to fulfill and ive got two children to bring up i do things differently because i dont go by a rule book because i lead from the heart not the head and albeit thats got me into trouble in my work i understand that everyone needs to be valued everyone has the potential to give something back the worst illness of our time is that so many people have to suffer from not ever being loved oh my god whats happened
