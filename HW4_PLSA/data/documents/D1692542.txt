hebrew חקרא or חקרה ancient greek ἄκρα was a fortified compound in jerusalem built by antiochus epiphanes ruler of the seleucid empire following his sack of the city in 168 bce the fortress played a significant role in the events surrounding the maccabean revolt and the formation of the hasmonean kingdom it was destroyed by simon maccabeus during this struggle the exact location of the acra critical to understanding hellenistic jerusalem had been a matter of lengthy discussions historians and archaeologists had proposed various sites around jerusalem relying mainly on conclusions drawn from literary evidence this approach began to change in the light of excavations which commenced in the late 1960s new discoveries had prompted reassessments of the ancient literary sources jerusalems geography and previously discovered artifacts yoram tsafrir had interpreted a masonry joint in the southeastern corner of the temple mount platform as a clue to the acras possible position during benjamin mazar s 1968 and 1978 excavations adjacent to the south wall of the mount features were uncovered which may have been connected with the acra including barracklike rooms and a huge cistern in november 2015 the israel antiquities authority announced the likely discovery of the acra in a different location southwest of the temple mount and northwest of the city of david the ancient greek term acra was used to describe other fortified structures during the hellenistic period the acra is often called the seleucid acra to distinguish it from references to the ptolemaic baris as an acra

contested between the ptolemaic kingdom in egypt and the seleucid empire based in syria and mesopotamia seleucid emperor antiochus iii s victory over egypt in the battle of panium brought judea under seleucid control the jewish population of jerusalem had aided antiochus during his siege of the baris the fortified base of jerusalems egyptian garrison 1 their support was rewarded with a charter affirming jewish religious autonomy including barring foreigners and impure animals from the temples precincts and an allocation of official funds for the maintenance of certain religious rituals in the temple 2 despite being allowed religious freedom many jews were enticed by and adopted elements of the prestigious and influential greek lifestyle the imperial culture offered a route to political and material advancement and this led to the formation of hellenistic elites among the jewish population hellenization produced tensions between observant jews and their brethren who had assimilated greek culture 3antonio ciseri s martyrdom of the maccabees 1863 depicting an episode from antiochus ivs seated persecution of the jews antiochus iv epiphanes ascended the seleucid throne in 175 bce shortly afterward epiphanes was petitioned by jason for appointment to the position of high priest of israel —an office occupied by his brother onias iii jason himself thoroughly hellenized furthermore promised to increase the tribute paid by the city and to establish within it the infrastructure of a greek polis including a gymnasium and an ephebion 4 jasons petition was granted yet after a 42month rule he was ousted by antiochus and forced to flee to ammon 5 6 in the meantime antiochus iv had launched two invasions of egypt in 170 bce and again in 169 bce and routed the ptolemaic armies 7 8 9 antiochus victories were shortlived his intent to unify the seleucid and ptolemaic kingdoms alarmed the rapidly expanding roman state which demanded that he withdraw his forces from egypt 9 10 with antiochus engaged in egypt a false rumor spread in jerusalem that he had been killed in the ensuing uncertainty jason gathered a force of 1000 followers and attempted to take jerusalem by storm although the attack was repulsed when word of the fighting reached antiochus in egypt he suspected his judean subjects of exploiting his setback as an opportunity to revolt in 168 bce antiochus iv epiphanes marched on and sacked jerusalem looting the temple treasury and killing thousands of its residents 11 12 13 reversing his fathers policy antiochus iv issued decrees outlawing traditional jewish rites and persecuting observant jews temple rituals were discontinued jewish observance of sabbath prohibited and circumcision outlawed 14 15construction  editto consolidate his hold on the city monitor events on the temple mount and safeguard the hellenized faction in jerusalem antiochus stationed a seleucid garrison in the city 16 17and they built the city of david with a great and strong wall and with strong towers and made it a fortress greek acra for them and they placed there a sinful nation wicked men and they fortified themselves therein and they stored up armour and victuals and gathered together the spoils of jerusalem and laid them up there and they became a great snare and this was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary and an evil devil in israel— 1 maccabees 135–38 18the name acra derived from the greek acropolis and signified a lofty fortified place overlooking a town in jerusalem the word came to symbolize antijewish paganism a fortress of the impious and wicked 17 dominating both the city and the surrounding countryside it was occupied not only by a greek garrison but by their jewish confederates as well 19the seleucid suppression of jewish religious life met with considerable resistance among the native population while antiochus was occupied in the east during 167 bce a rural priest mattathias of modiin raised a rebellion against the empire 20 both the seleucid administration and the local hellenized faction failed to grasp the magnitude of the revolt in 164 bce judas maccabaeus liberated jerusalem and reconsecrated the temple although the surrounding city had fallen the acra and its inhabitants held out maccabaeus besieged the fortress whose inhabitants sent an appeal to the seleucid king now antiochus v for assistance a seleucid army was dispatched to put down the revolt when it laid siege to bethzur maccabaeus was forced to abandon his siege of the acra and face antiochus in battle in the subsequent battle of bethzechariah the seleucids won their first victory over the maccabees and maccabaeus was forced to withdraw 21 spared from capitulation the acra persisted as a seleucid stronghold for 20 more years during which it weathered several hasmonean attempts to oust the greek garrison 17 22destruction  editjudas besieging the acra  alba bible 1430judas was killed in 160 bce and succeeded by his brother jonathan who attempted to build a barrier to cut off the acras supply line 23 jonathan had already assembled the manpower required for the task when he was forced to confront the invading army of seleucid general diodotus tryphon at beth shan scythopolis 24 25 having invited jonathan to a friendly conference tryphon had him seized and murdered 26 jonathan was succeeded by another brother simon who besieged and finally captured the acra in 141 bce 27two sources provide information about the ultimate fate of the acra although their accounts are contradictory in places according to josephus simon razed the acra after ousting its inhabitants and then quarried the hill on which it had stood to render it lower than the temple purge the city of its evil memory and deny it to any future occupier of jerusalem 28 the account appearing in 1 maccabees paints a different picture and simon decreed that every year they should celebrate this day with rejoicing he strengthened the fortifications of the temple hill alongside the citadel greek acra  and he and his men dwelt there— 1 maccabees 1352 29thus in this version simon did not immediately demolish the acra but instead had it occupied and may even have resided within it himself 1 maccabees does not mention its ultimate fate the fortress had been built as an internal checkpoint to monitor and control jerusalem and its population if situated in the city of david as most scholars agree its location would have added very little to jerusalems defenses against external threats it may have fallen out of use and been dismantled around the end of the 2nd century bce following the construction of the hasmonean baris and hasmonean palace in jerusalems upper city 23bezalel barkochva  he offers a different theory the acra was still standing in 139 bce when antiochus vii sidetes demanded it back from simon along with jaffa and gezer two hellenized cities simon had captured 30 31 simon was willing to discuss the two cities but made no mention of the acra 32 it was at this point that he must have sealed its fate as a way to deny the seleucids any future claim or hold on jerusalem thus when antiochus vii subdued the city during hyrcanus i s reign each and every one of his demands were met—except the one demanding the stationing of a seleucid garrison in the city 33 hyrcanus may have been able to reject and antiochus to drop this demand because there was nowhere to billet the garrison as the acra would no longer have been standing this explanation places the razing of the acra somewhere in the 130s bce 34 35location  edit1903 map of jerusalem identifying the acra with the entire south eastern hill the location of the acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in jerusalem during the struggle between maccabean and seleucid forces 16 23 this has been the subject of debate among modern scholars 36 the most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the acra is found in josephus  antiquities of the jews where it is described as residing in the lower city upon a hill overlooking the temple enclosureand when he had overthrown the city walls he built a citadel greek acra in the lower part of the city for the place was high and overlooked the temple on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers and put into it a garrison of macedonians however in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities— flavius josephus antiquities of the jews 12252–253 37the location of the lower part of the city elsewhere referred to as the lower city at the time of josephus 1st century ce is accepted to be jerusalems southeastern hill the original urban center traditionally known as the city of david lying to the south of the temple mount however the area exposed today is significantly lower than the mount itself the top of the mount is approximately 30 metres 98 ft above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later herodianera expansion of the temple enclosure the elevation decreases to the south of this point 17 josephus a native of jerusalem 38 would have been well aware of this discrepancy yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how simon had razed both the acra and the hill on which it had stood archaeological research south of the temple mount however has failed to locate any evidence for such large scale quarrying 17 on the contrary excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium bce down to roman times 39 casting doubt on the suggestion that during hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the time of josephus or that a large hill had been cleared away 34 this had led many researchers to disregard josephus account and his placing of the acra and suggest several alternate locations 19 since 1841 when edward robinson proposed the area near the church of the holy sepulchre as the site of the acra at least nine different locations in and around the old city of jerusalem have been put forward 40 41western hill  editseveral researchers have attempted to place the acra in the upper city on jerusalems western hill within the area currently occupied by the old citys jewish quarter 34 40 42 these propositions seek to locate the acra within antiochia the hellenistic polis established in jerusalem according to 2 maccabees this conjectural new city would have been hippodamic in plan and therefore would have required a flat expanse of land which only the western hill could have provided 40 furthermore the eastern edge of the hill is adjacent to the temple mount and higher in altitude—two characteristics attributed to the seleucid citadel 42opponents of this proposed location point out that there is very little archaeological or historical evidence supporting the establishment of a hellenistic polis within jerusalem let alone sited on the western hill which appears to have been only sparsely populated during the hellenistic period excavations in todays jewish quarter display evidence of habitation from the first temple period as well as renewed hasmonean and herodian settlement but scant evidence of hellenistic occupation 16 40 research into the dispersal of stamped rhodian amphorae handles has revealed that over 95 of these handles found in jerusalem were excavated from the city of david indicating the city had not yet expanded to the western hill during seleucid rule 43 furthermore the western hill is separated from the temple mount and the city of david by the steep tyropoeon valley —a distinct tactical disadvantage for any force that may have been required to intervene in events within the temple precincts or heavily populated eastern sectors of jerusalem 42north of the temple  editthe acra was not the first hellenistic stronghold in jerusalem sources indicate that an earlier citadel the ptolemaic baris had also occupied a location overlooking the temples precincts although the exact location of the baris is still debated it is generally accepted to have stood north of the temple mount on the site later occupied by the antonia fortress 17 the baris fell to antiochus iii at the turn of the 2nd century bce and is absent from all accounts of the maccabean revolt 34 despite the narratives which have the acra constructed within a very short timespan it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege these factors coupled with references in which the baris was itself called an acra 1 have led some to suggest that the baris and the acra were in fact the same structure although both 1 maccabees and josephus seem to describe the acra as a new construction this may not have been the case antiquities of the jews 12253 may be translated to give the sense that the impious or wicked had remained rather than dwelt in the citadel which could be taken to mean that the acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the macedonian garrison was new 41 44koen decoster proposes that josephus wrote of a citadel in the lower part of the city to an audience that would have been familiar with the jerusalem of the 1st century ce—a city that did feature two citadels the antonia fortress and the herodian palace as josephus roman jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill a citadel in the lower city could have referred to anything located east of the tyropoeon valley including the antonia which stood north of the temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it in his view this is the place josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the acra 45opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources and that this would place the acra away from jerusalems population center unlike its predecessor and successor citadels it was not meant as a defence against external threat but rather to oversee the inhabited jewish parts of the city a role incompatible with a proposed northern location 34a fortified compound in the city of david  editthe available sources do indicate the acra stood south of the temple and because 1 maccabees is a contemporaneous account of the maccabean revolt its account of the acra 135–38 is considered the most reliable 17 josephus provides an unlikely account of the razing of a hill on which the acra had stood yet his description of the end of the great revolt 70 ce provides additional evidence for it being located south of the temple mountbut on the next day they set fire to the repository of the archives to acra to the councilhouse and to the place called ophlas at which time the fire proceeded as far as the palace of queen helena which was in the middle of acra— flavius josephus the wars of the jews 6354 46as the other buildings mentioned in the account all stood to the south in the lower city this also places the acra there this account attests to the persistence of the name acra in this part of jerusalem many years after hellenistic rule ended and its citadels had been overthrown and it can also be seen as referring not to a distinct building but rather to an entire region of the city indeed several clauses in 1 maccabees may be read as making a similar point 47about five hundred men of the army of nicanor fell and the rest fled into the city of david— 1 maccabees 732 48and in his days things prospered in his hands so that the gentiles were put out of the country as were also the men in the city of david in jerusalem who had built themselves a citadel greek acra from which they used to sally forth and defile the environs of the sanctuary and do great damage to its purity— 1 maccabees 1436 49these suggest that after the sacking of jerusalem by antiochus iv in 168 bce at least part of the city of david to the south of the temple mount was rebuilt as a fortified hellenistic quarter of jerusalem 17 more than a citadel it was a macedonian colony where jewish renegades and supporters of the new regime lived 23 this is also supported by archaeological evidence including rhodian amphorae handles and 18 box graves found on the eastern slope of the city of david the latter are dated to the early 2nd century ce and are uncharacteristic of second temple era jewish burial practices yet similar to other known hellenistic graveyards such as the one in acre ptolemais 41 50 51a citadel nevertheless  editseam along eastern wall of temple mount separating hellenistic right from herodian left construction southern wall of the temple mount and remains of a building excavated by mazar and identified it as part of the acra ophel cistern possible remnant of the acra the glacis associated with the acra unearthed in 2015 in the givaty parking lot dig even if the name acra were applied to an entire hellenistic quarter rather than to just a fortress it is likely that a citadel would have stood within that compound to billet the macedonian garrison which occupied it 34 it was normal for a hellenistic city to have a fortified stronghold at or near the highest point of its walled area 19 thus whether a part of a larger enclave or independent of its surroundings a citadel probably did stand at the northern tip of the city of david just south of the temple mount archaeologists have tried to use finds from excavations conducted in the area to pinpoint this citadels precise location yoram tsafrir has attempted to place the acra underneath the southeastern corner of the temple mount enclosure 40 41 52 tsafrir points to a straight vertical seam in the enclosures eastern masonry wall as evidence of different periods of construction north of the seam is an early section of the wall built of large ashlar blocks these blocks have faces with drafted margins 16 around a prominent boss and are laid in homogeneous header and stretcher courses one above the other 53 this style of construction is hellenistic and distinct from the herodian construction apparent south of the seam although the exact dating of this construction in uncertain tsafrir believes it is a remnant of the acras foundations which were later incorporated into herod the great s extension of the temple platform 23 40 53 as further proof tzafrir also points to significant similarity between construction methods evident north of the seam including the use of trapezoidshaped stones with the methods employed in the seleucid city of perga in asia minor 1 macabees 130 attributes construction of the acra to apollonius antiochus iiis chief collector  hebrew שרהמיסים  sar hamissim  which appears to be an ancient mistranslation or his original title as chief  hebrew שר  sar of the mysians a people of asia minor 40 53meir bendov believed that the acra stood just south of the huldah gates of the southern wall of the herodian temple mount platform benjamin mazars excavations of the ophel the area adjoining the southern portion of the platform have unearthed the foundations of a massive structure and a large cistern both possibly dating to the hellenistic period these have been tentatively identified as remnants of the acra with the structure featuring rows of small interconnected rooms believed to be the remains of a barracks these had been demolished and built over during the hasmonean period matching the descriptions in josephus the hasmonean constructions were in turn flattened to create a public square fronting the main gates to the temple platform during the herodian renovations 54 55several cisterns under the temple mount itself have also been proposed as possible remnants of the seleucid citadel these include a 700000 imperial gallons 3200000 l 840000 us gal cistern shaped like an e the northern edge of which is adjacent to the proposed southern line of the temple mount precinct before its herodian expansion 56 this has been identified as the beer haqar or bor heqer mentioned in the mishnah erubin tract 1014 57 and commonly translated perhaps incorrectly as the cold well 58additional evidence for the existence of the acra may come from the chance discovery published by shimon appelbaum  he of a fragmentary greek inscription in the old city of jerusalem the inscription is a fragment from the top of a sandstone stele and contains what may be an oath taken by soldiers stationed in the acra although the reading of the name acra in the text has been contested 16 592015 discovery  editin november 2015 the israel antiquities authority announced the probable discovery of the acra according to archaeologists doron benami yana tchekhanovets and salome cohen excavating the givati parking lot adjacent to the city of david they had unearthed a complex of rooms and fortified walls they identified as the acra this places it slightly south of previous suggested locations on the ophel finds include fortification walls a watchtower measuring 4 by 20 meters and a glacis bronze arrowheads lead slingstones and ballista stones were unearthed at the site stamped with a trident the emblem of antiochus iv epiphanes these are indicative of the military nature of the site and the efforts to take it the excavation also yielded coins from the reigns of antiochus iv through antiochus vii as well as a multitude of stamped rhodian amphora handles 60 61the givati location has been questioned due to its being too low on the hill to overlook the temple mount as
