types of term loan payment schedules file c593 written may 2013pdf format many loans are repaid by using a series of payments over a period of time these payments usually include an interest amount computed on the unpaid balance of the loan plus a portion of the unpaid balance of the loan this payment of a portion of the unpaid balance of the loan is called a payment of principal there are generally two types of loan repayment schedules  even principal payments and even total payments even principal payments with the even principal payment schedule the size of the principal payment is the same for every payment it is computed by dividing the amount of the original loan by the number of payments for example the 10000 loan shown in table 1 is divided by the 20 payment periods of one year each resulting in a principal payment of 500 per loan payment interest is computed on the amount of the unpaid balance of the loan at each payment period because the unpaid balance of the loan decreases with each principal payment the size of the interest payment of each loan payment also decreases this results in a decrease in the total payment principal plus interest as shown in figure 1 as shown in table 1 the total payment decreases from 1200 500 principal and 700 interest in year one to 535 500 principal and 35 interest in year 20 the total amount paid over the 20 year period is 17350 which consists of the 10000 loan plus 7350 of interest even total payments the even total payment schedule is comprised of a decreasing interest payment and an increasing principal payment the decrease in the size of the interest payment is matched by an increase in the size of the principal payment so that the size of the total loan payment remains constant over the life of the loan figure 2 as shown in table 2 the interest payment decreases as the unpaid balance decreases the remainder of the loan payment is principal payment the large unpaid balance early in the life of the loan means that most of the total payment is interest with only a small principal payment because the principal payment is small during the early periods the unpaid balance of the loan decreases slowly however as the payments progress over the life of the loan the unpaid balance declines resulting in a smaller interest payment and allowing for a larger principal payment the larger principal payment in turn increases the rate of decline in the unpaid balance for example the interest payment is 700 and the principal payment is 244 during the first year as shown in table 2 the interest payment is 62 and principal payment is 882 during the last loan payment in year 20 this is in contrast to the even principal payment schedule where the principal payment is constant over the repayment period and the unpaid balance declines by the same amount each period 500 principal payment resulting in a fixed reduction in the interest payment each period of 35 7 x 500  35 the total amount paid over the 20 year period is 18879 which consists of the 10000 loan plus 8879 of interest unpaid balance the unpaid balance of the loan using the even principal payment schedule decreases by a fixed amount with each payment as shown in table 1 the unpaid balance is reduced by 500 each year after 10 years half way through the repayment period the unpaid balance of the loan is 5000 half of the original 10000 loan by contrast the size of the unpaid balance of the even total payment schedule declines slowly during the early term of the loan eg 244 the first year and declines quickly towards the end of the loan term eg 822 in year 20 as shown in table 2 the unpaid balance in year 10 half way through the term of the loan is 6630 over half of the loan is yet to be repaid this difference in the rate of decline of the unpaid balance of the two repayment schedules is shown in figure 3 because the unpaid balance of the loan using the even total payment repayment schedule declines more slowly than the even principal payment repayment schedule the total amount of interest paid over 20 years is greater with the even total payment schedule for example in tables 1 and 2 the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan is 7350 using the even principal payment schedule and 8878 using the even total payment schedule for an increase of 1528 correspondingly the total cost of repaying the loan is greater by the same amount for the even total payment schedule balloon payments some term loans include a balloon payment with this structure the remaining balance of the loan comes due after a portion of the annual payments have been made table 3 shows an even total payment schedule that is amortized spread over forty years however at the tenth annual payment the remaining balance of the loan comes due this is the balloon payment of 10058 which is comprised of 9400 remaining balance on the loan and 658 of annual interest due in year ten as shown in the table the balloon provision may be used when a business has limited repayment capacity in the early years but is able to repay or refinance the loan after several years of operation 10 years in this case the length of the amortization schedule and the timing of the balloon payments can be designed to fit the individual situation the loan may be amortized over a long period of time eg 40 years in the example to keep the payments small in the early years in some cases the early payments may be not be paid but compounded into the balloon payment even loan payment computation a financial calculator or an electronic spreadsheet on a personal computer is a useful tool for computing loan payments using the even total payment schedule“pv” represents the amount borrowed“rate” or “i” represents the interest rate per payment period“n” or “nper” represents the number of payment periods“pmt” represents the loan payment per payment period you can compute any of the four loan values above as long as you know the other three values you can compute the loan payment if you know the amount borrowed the interest rate and the length of the loan number of payment periods for example if you borrow 10000 at 7 over 20 years your annual payment is 94393 amount borrowed pv  10000interest rate per period rate  7 per year number of periods borrowed nper  20 years loan payments pmt   loan payments pmt  94393you can compute the interest rate if you know the amount borrowed the loan payment and the length of the loan number of payment periods for example if you borrow 10000 over 20 years and your loan payment is 94393 your interest payment is 7 amount borrowed pv 10000loan payments pmt 94393number of period borrowed nper  20 years interest rate rate   interest rate rate  7you can compute the number of loan payments if you know the amount borrowed the loan payment and the interest rate for example if you borrow 10000 at 7 interest and your payment is 94393 it will take 20 years to repay the loan amount borrowed
