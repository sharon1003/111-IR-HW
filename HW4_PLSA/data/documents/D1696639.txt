tila and sections 4 and 5 of respa as a result regulation z now houses the integrated forms timing and related disclosure requirements for most closedend consumer mortgage loans purpose  editit was created because various companies associated with the buying and selling of real estate such as lenders real estate agents construction companies and title insurance companies were often engaging in providing undisclosed kickbacks to each other inflating the costs of real estate transactions and obscuring price competition by facilitating baitandswitch tactics for example a lender advertising a home loan might have advertised the loan with a 5 interest rate but then when one applies for the loan one is told that one must use the lenders affiliated title insurance company and pay 5000 for the service whereas the normal rate is 1000 the title company would then have paid 4000 to the lender this was made illegal in order to make prices for the services clear so as to allow price competition by consumer demand and to thereby drive down prices on july 21 2011 administration and enforcement of the real estate settlement procedures act respa was transferred from the department of housing and urban development to the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb general requirements  editrespa outlines requirements that lenders must follow when providing mortgages that are secured by federally

days the servicer then has 30 business days from the request to take action on the request the servicer has to either provide a written notification that the error has been corrected or provide a written explanation as to why the servicer believes the account is correct either way the servicer has to provide the name and telephone number of a person with whom the borrower can discuss the matter the servicer cannot provide information to any credit agency regarding any overdue payment during the 60day period if the servicer fails to comply with the qualified written request the borrower is entitled to actual damages up to 2000 of additional damages if there is a pattern of noncompliance costs and attorneys fees 3criticisms  edithowever critics say that kickbacks still occur for example lenders often provide captive insurance to the title insurance companies they work with which critics say is essentially a kickback mechanism others counter that economically the transaction is a zero sum game where if the kickback were forbidden a lender would simply charge higher prices to which others counter that the intended goal of the legislation is transparency which it would provide if the lender must absorb the cost of the hidden kickback into the fee they charge one of the core elements of the debate is the fact that customers overwhelmingly go with the default service providers associated with a lender or a real estate agent even though they sign documents explicitly stating that they can choose to use any service provider there have been various proposals to modify the real estate settlement procedures act one proposal is to change the open architecture system currently in place where a customer can choose to use any service provider for each service to one where the services are bundled but where the real estate agent or lender must pay directly for all other costs under this system lenders who have more buying power would more aggressively seek the lowest price for real estate settlement services while both the hud1 and hud1a serve to disclose all fees costs and charges to both the buyer and seller involved in a real estate transaction it is not uncommon to find mistakes on the hud both buyer and seller should know how to properly read a hud before closing a transaction and at settlement is not the ideal time to discover unnecessary charges andor exorbitant fees as the transaction is about to be closed buyers or sellers can hire an experienced professional such as a real estate agent or an attorney to protect their interests at
