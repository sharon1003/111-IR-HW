from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search this article is about the direction finding instrument used in navigation for other uses see compass disambiguation a simple dry magnetic portable compass a smartphone that can be used as a compass because of the magnetometer inside a compass is an instrument used for navigation and orientation that shows direction relative to the geographic cardinal directions or points usually a diagram called a compass rose shows the directions north south east and west on the compass face as abbreviated initials when the compass is used the rose can be aligned with the corresponding geographic directions for example the n mark on the rose points northward compasses often display markings for angles in degrees in addition to or sometimes instead of the rose north corresponds to 0° and the angles increase clockwise so east is 90° degrees south is 180° and west is 270° these numbers allow the compass to show azimuths or bearings which are commonly stated in this notation among the four great inventions the magnetic compass was first invented as a device for divination as early as the chinese han dynasty since c 206 bc 1 2 and later adopted for navigation by the song dynasty chinese during the 11th century 3 4 5 the first usage of a compass recorded in western europe and the islamic world occurred around 1190 6 7contents  hide 1

see also7 notes8 references9 external links magnetic compass  edita military compass that was used during world war ithe magnetic compass is the most familiar compass type it functions as a pointer to  magnetic north  the local magnetic meridian because the magnetized needle at its heart aligns itself with the horizontal component of the earths magnetic field the magnetic field exerts a torque on the needle pulling the north end or pole of the needle approximately toward the earths north magnetic pole and pulling the other toward the earths south magnetic pole 8 the needle is mounted on a lowfriction pivot point in better compasses a jewel bearing so it can turn easily when the compass is held level the needle turns until after a few seconds to allow oscillations to die out it settles into its equilibrium orientation in navigation directions on maps are usually expressed with reference to geographical or true north the direction toward the geographical north pole the rotation axis of the earth depending on where the compass is located on the surface of the earth the angle between true north and magnetic north called magnetic declination can vary widely with geographic location the local magnetic declination is given on most maps to allow the map to be oriented with a compass parallel to true north the location of the earths magnetic poles slowly change with time which is referred to as geomagnetic secular variation the effect of this means a map with the latest declination information should be used 9 some magnetic compasses include means to manually compensate for the magnetic declination so that the compass shows true directions history  editmain article history of the compass the first compasses in ancient han dynasty china were made of lodestone a naturally magnetized ore of iron 2 10 the compass was later used for navigation during the song dynasty of the 11th century 11 later compasses were made of iron needles magnetized by striking them with a lodestone dry compasses began to appear around 1300 in medieval europe and the islamic world 12 7 this was supplanted in the early 20th century by the liquidfilled magnetic compass 13modern compasses  edita liquidfilled protractor or orienteering compass with lanyard magnetic compass  editmodern compasses usually use a magnetized needle or dial inside a capsule completely filled with a liquid lamp oil mineral oil white spirits purified kerosene or ethyl alcohol are common while older designs commonly incorporated a flexible rubber diaphragm or airspace inside the capsule to allow for volume changes caused by temperature or altitude some modern liquid compasses utilize smaller housings andor flexible capsule materials to accomplish the same result 14 the liquid inside the capsule serves to damp the movement of the needle reducing oscillation time and increasing stability key points on the compass including the north end of the needle are often marked with phosphorescent photoluminescent or selfluminous materials 15 to enable the compass to be read at night or in poor light as the compass fill liquid is noncompressible under pressure many ordinary liquidfilled compasses will operate accurately underwater to considerable depths many modern compasses incorporate a baseplate and protractor tool and are referred to variously as  orienteering  baseplate map compass or protractor designs this type of compass uses a separate magnetized needle inside a rotating capsule an orienting box or gate for aligning the needle with magnetic north a transparent base containing map orienting lines and a bezel outer dial marked in degrees or other units of angular measurement 16 the capsule is mounted in a transparent baseplate containing a directionoftravel dot indicator for use in taking bearings directly from a map 16cammenga air filled lensatic compass other features found on modern orienteering compasses are map and romer scales for measuring distances and plotting positions on maps luminous markings on the face or bezels various sighting mechanisms mirror prism etc for taking bearings of distant objects with greater precision gimbalmounted global needles for use in differing hemispheres special rareearth magnets to stabilize compass needles adjustable declination for obtaining instant true bearings without resorting to arithmetic and devices such as inclinometers for measuring gradients 17 the sport of orienteering has also resulted in the development of models with extremely fastsettling and stable needles utilizing rareearth magnets for optimal use with a topographic map a land navigation technique known as terrain association 18the military forces of a few nations notably the united states army continue to issue field compasses with magnetized compass dials or cards instead of needles a magnetic card compass is usually equipped with an optical lensatic or prismatic sight which allows the user to read the bearing or azimuth off the compass card while simultaneously aligning the compass with the objective see photo magnetic card compass designs normally require a separate protractor tool in order to take bearings directly from a map 19 20the u s m1950 military lensatic compass does not use a liquidfilled capsule as a damping mechanism but rather electromagnetic induction to control oscillation of it magnetized card a deepwell design is used to allow the compass to be used globally with a card tilt of up to 8 degrees without impairing accuracy 21 as induction forces provide less damping than fluidfilled designs a needle lock is fitted to the compass to reduce wear operated by the folding action of the rear sightlens holder the use of airfilled induction compasses has declined over the years as they may become inoperative or inaccurate in freezing temperatures or extremely humid environments due to condensation or water ingress 22some military compasses like the u s m1950  cammenga 3h military lensatic compass the silva 4b militaire and the suunto m5n t contain the radioactive material tritium  1 h 3 and a combination of phosphors 23 the u s m1950 equipped with selfluminous lighting contains 120 m ci millicuries of tritium the purpose of the tritium and phosphors is to provide illumination for the compass via radioluminescent tritium illumination which does not require the compass to be recharged by sunlight or artificial light 24 however tritium has a halflife of only about 12 years 25 so a compass that contains 120 m ci of tritium when new will contain only 60 when it is 12 years old 30 when it is 24 years old and so on consequently the illumination of the display will fade mariners compasses can have two or more magnets permanently attached to a compass card which moves freely on a pivot a lubber line which can be a marking on the compass bowl or a small fixed needle indicates the ships heading on the compass card traditionally the card is divided into thirtytwo points known as rhumbs  although modern compasses are marked in degrees rather than cardinal points the glasscovered box or bowl contains a suspended gimbal within a binnacle this preserves the horizontal position thumb compass  editmain article thumb compass thumb compass on left a thumb compass is a type of compass commonly used in orienteering a sport in which map reading and terrain association are paramount consequently most thumb compasses have minimal or no degree markings at all and are normally used only to orient the map to magnetic north an oversized rectangular needle or north indicator aids visibility thumb compasses are also often transparent so that an orienteer can hold a map in the hand with the compass and see the map through the compass the best models use rareearth magnets to reduce needle settling time to 1 second or less gyrocompass  editmain article gyrocompass a gyrocompass is similar to a gyroscope it is a nonmagnetic compass that finds true north by using an electrically powered fastspinning wheel and friction forces in order to exploit the rotation of the earth gyrocompasses are widely used on ships they have two main advantages over magnetic compassesthey find true north ie the direction of earth s rotational axis as opposed to magnetic norththey are not affected by ferromagnetic metal including iron steel cobalt nickel and various alloys in a ships hull no compass is affected by nonferromagnetic metal although a magnetic compass will be affected by any kind of wires with electric current passing through them large ships typically rely on a gyrocompass using the magnetic compass only as a backup increasingly electronic fluxgate compasses are used on smaller vessels however magnetic compasses are still widely in use as they can be small use simple reliable technology are comparatively cheap are often easier to use than gps require no energy supply and unlike gps are not affected by objects eg trees that can block the reception of electronic signals solid state compasses  editmain article magnetometer3axis electronic magnetometer akm8975 by akm semiconductor small compasses found in clocks mobile phones and other electronic devices are solidstate microelectromechanical systems mems compasses usually built out of two or three magnetic field sensors that provide data for a microprocessor often the device is a discrete component which outputs either a digital or analog signal proportional to its orientation this signal is interpreted by a controller or microprocessor and either used internally or sent to a display unit the sensor uses highly calibrated internal electronics to measure the response of the device to the earths magnetic field gps receivers used as compasses  editgps receivers using two or more antennae mounted separately and blending the data with an inertial motion unit imu can now achieve 002° in heading accuracy and have startup times in seconds rather than hours for gyrocompass systems the devices accurately determine the positions latitudes longitudes and altitude of the antennae on the earth from which the cardinal directions can be calculated manufactured primarily for maritime and aviation applications they can also detect pitch and roll of ships small portable gps receivers with only a single antenna can also determine directions if they are being moved even if only at walking pace by accurately determining its position on the earth at times a few seconds apart the device can calculate its speed and the true bearing relative to true north of its direction of motion frequently it is preferable to measure the direction in which a vehicle is actually moving rather than its heading ie the direction in which its nose is pointing these directions may be different if there is a crosswind or tidal current gps compasses share the main advantages of gyrocompasses they determine true north  citation needed as opposed to magnetic north and they are unaffected by perturbations of the earths magnetic field additionally compared with gyrocompasses they are much cheaper they work better in polar regions they are less prone to be affected by mechanical vibration and they can be initialized far more quickly however they depend on the functioning of and communication with the gps satellites which might be disrupted by an electronic attack or by the effects of a severe solar storm gyrocompasses remain in use for military purposes especially in submarines where magnetic and gps compasses are useless but have been largely superseded by gps compasses with magnetic backups in civilian contexts specialty compasses  edita standard brunton geo used commonly by geologists apart from navigational compasses other specialty compasses have also been designed to accommodate specific uses these include qibla compass which is used by muslims to show the direction to mecca for prayers optical or prismatic handbearing compass most often used by surveyors but also by cave explorers foresters and geologists these compasses generally use a liquiddamped capsule 26 and magnetized floating compass dial with an integral optical sight often fitted with builtin photoluminescent or batterypowered illumination 27 using the optical sight such compasses can be read with extreme accuracy when taking bearings to an object often to fractions of a degree most of these compasses are designed for heavyduty use with highquality needles and jeweled bearings and many are fitted for tripod mounting for additional accuracy 27trough compasses mounted in a rectangular box whose length was often several times its width date back several centuries they were used for land surveying particularly with plane tables limitations of the magnetic compass  edita close up photo of a geological compass the magnetic compass is very reliable at moderate latitudes but in geographic regions near the earths magnetic poles it becomes unusable as the compass is moved closer to one of the magnetic poles the magnetic declination the difference between the direction to geographical north and magnetic north becomes greater and greater at some point close to the magnetic pole the compass will not indicate any particular direction but will begin to drift also the needle starts to point up or down when getting closer to the poles because of the socalled magnetic inclination cheap compasses with bad bearings may get stuck because of this and therefore indicate a wrong direction magnetic compasses are influenced by any fields other than earths local environments may contain magnetic mineral deposits and artificial sources such as mris large iron or steel bodies electrical engines or strong permanent magnets any electrically conductive body produces its own magnetic field when it is carrying an electric current magnetic compasses are prone to errors in the neighborhood of such bodies some compasses include magnets which can be adjusted to compensate for external magnetic fields making the compass more reliable and accurate a compass is also subject to errors when the compass is accelerated or decelerated in an airplane or automobile depending on which of the earths hemispheres the compass is located and if the force is acceleration or deceleration the compass will increase or decrease the indicated heading compasses that include compensating magnets are especially prone to these errors since accelerations tilt the needle bringing it closer or further from the magnets another error of the mechanical compass is turning error when one turns from a heading of east or west the compass will lag behind the turn or lead ahead of the turn magnetometers and substitutes such as gyrocompasses are more stable in such situations construction of a magnetic compass  editmagnetic needle  edita magnetic rod is required when constructing a compass this can be created by aligning an iron or steel rod with earths magnetic field and then tempering or striking it however this method produces only a weak magnet so other methods are preferred for example a magnetised rod can be created by repeatedly rubbing an iron rod with a magnetic lodestone this magnetised rod or magnetic needle is then placed on a low friction surface to allow it to freely pivot to align itself with the magnetic field it is then labeled so the user can distinguish the northpointing from the southpointing end in modern convention the north end is typically marked in some way needleandbowl device  editif a needle is rubbed on a lodestone or other magnet the needle becomes magnetized when it is inserted in a cork or piece of wood and placed in a bowl of water it becomes a compass such devices were universally used as compass until the invention of the boxlike compass with a dry pivoting needle sometime around 1300 points of the compass  editmain article points of the compass wrist compass of the soviet army with counterclockwise double graduation 60° like a watch and 360°originally many compasses were marked only as to the direction of magnetic north or to the four cardinal points north south east west later these were divided in china into 24 and in europe into 32 equally spaced points around the compass card for a table of the thirtytwo points see compass points in the modern era the 360degree system took hold this system is still in use today for civilian navigators the degree system spaces 360 equidistant points located clockwise around the compass dial in the 19th century some european nations adopted the  grad  also called grade or gon system instead where a right angle is 100 grads to give a circle of 400 grads dividing grads into tenths to give a circle of 4000 decigrades has also been used in armies most military forces have adopted the french  millieme  system this is an approximation of a milliradian 6283 per circle in which the compass dial is spaced into 6400 units or mils for additional precision when measuring angles laying artillery etc the value to the military is that one angular mil subtends approximately one metre at a distance of one kilometer imperial russia used a system derived by dividing the circumference of a circle into chords of the same length as the radius each of these was divided into 100 spaces giving a circle of 600 the soviet union divided these into tenths to give a circle of 6000 units usually translated as mils this system was adopted by the former warsaw pact countries eg soviet union east germany  often counterclockwise see picture of wrist compass this is still in use in russia compass balancing magnetic dip  editbecause the earths magnetic fields inclination and intensity vary at different latitudes compasses are often balanced during manufacture so that the dial or needle will be level eliminating needle drag which can give inaccurate readings most manufacturers balance their compass needles for one of five zones ranging from zone 1 covering most of the northern hemisphere to zone 5 covering australia and the southern oceans this individual zone balancing prevents excessive dipping of one end of the needle which can cause the compass card to stick and give false readings 28some compasses feature a special needle balancing system that will accurately indicate magnetic north regardless of the particular magnetic zone other magnetic compasses have a small sliding counterweight installed on the needle itself this sliding counterweight called a rider can be used for counterbalancing the needle against the dip caused by inclination if the compass is taken to a zone with a higher or lower dip 28compass correction  editmain article magnetic deviation a binnacle containing a ships standard compass with the two iron balls which correct the effects of ferromagnetic materials this unit is on display in a museum like any magnetic device compasses are affected by nearby ferrous materials as well as by strong local electromagnetic forces compasses used for wilderness land navigation should not be used in proximity to ferrous metal objects or electromagnetic fields car electrical systems automobile engines steel pitons etc as that can affect their accuracy 29 compasses are particularly difficult to use accurately in or near trucks cars or other mechanized vehicles even when corrected for deviation by the use of builtin magnets or other devices large amounts of ferrous metal combined with the onandoff electrical fields caused by the vehicles ignition and charging systems generally result in significant compass errors at sea a ships compass must also be corrected for errors called deviation caused by iron and steel in its structure and equipment the ship is swung that is rotated about a fixed point while its heading is noted by alignment with fixed points on the shore a compass deviation card is prepared so that the navigator can convert between compass and magnetic headings the compass can be corrected in three ways first the lubber line can be adjusted so that it is aligned with the direction in which the ship travels then the effects of permanent magnets can be corrected for by small magnets fitted within the case of the compass the effect of ferromagnetic materials in the compasss environment can be corrected by two iron balls mounted on either side of the compass binnacle the coefficient representing the error in the lubber line while the ferromagnetic effects and the nonferromagnetic component 30a similar process is used to calibrate the compass in light general aviation aircraft with the compass deviation card often mounted permanently just above or below the magnetic compass on the instrument panel fluxgate electronic compasses can be calibrated automatically and can also be programmed with the correct local compass variation so as to indicate the true heading using a magnetic compass  editturning the compass scale on the map d – the local magnetic declinationwhen the needle is aligned with and superimposed over the outlined orienting arrow on the bottom of the capsule the degree figure on the compass ring at the directionoftravel dot indicator gives the magnetic bearing to the target mountain a magnetic compass points to magnetic north pole which is approximately 1000 miles from the true geographic north pole a magnetic compasss user can determine true north by finding the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation variation is defined as the angle between the direction of true geographic north and the direction of the meridian between the magnetic poles variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914 31 deviation refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself mariners have long known that these measures do not completely cancel deviation hence they performed an additional step by measuring the compass bearing of a landmark with a known magnetic bearing they then pointed their ship to the next compass point and measured again graphing their results in this way correction tables could be created which would be consulted when compasses were used when traveling in those locations mariners are concerned about very accurate measurements however casual users need not be concerned with differences between magnetic and true north except in areas of extreme magnetic declination variance 20 degrees or more this is enough to protect from walking in a substantially different direction than expected over short distances provided the terrain is fairly flat and visibility is not impaired by carefully recording distances time or paces and magnetic bearings traveled one can plot a course and return to ones starting point using the compass alone 32soldier using a prismatic compass to get an azimuth compass navigation in conjunction with a map  terrain association requires a different method to take a map bearing or true bearing a bearing taken in reference to true not magnetic north to a destination with a protractor compass the edge of the compass is placed on the map so that it connects the current location with the desired destination some sources recommend physically drawing a line the orienting lines in the base of the compass dial are then rotated to align with actual or true north by aligning them with a marked line of longitude or the vertical margin of the map ignoring the compass needle entirely 33 the resulting true bearing or map bearing may then be read at the degree indicator or directionoftravel dot line which may be followed as an azimuth course to the destination if a magnetic north bearing or compass bearing is desired the compass must be adjusted by the amount of magnetic declination before using the bearing so that both map and compass are in agreement 33 in the given example the large mountain in the second photo was selected as the target destination on the map some compasses allow the scale to be adjusted to compensate for the local magnetic declination if adjusted correctly the compass will give the true bearing instead of the magnetic bearing the modern handheld protractor compass always has an additional directionoftravel dot arrow or indicator inscribed on the baseplate to check ones progress along a course or azimuth or to ensure that the object in view is indeed the destination a new compass reading may be taken to the target if visible here the large mountain after pointing the dot arrow on the baseplate at the target the compass is oriented so that the needle is superimposed over the orienting arrow in the capsule the resulting bearing indicated is the magnetic bearing to the target again if one is using true or map bearings and the compass does not have preset preadjusted declination one must additionally add or subtract magnetic declination to convert the magnetic bearing into a true bearing the exact value of the magnetic declination is placedependent and varies over time though declination is frequently given on the map itself or obtainable online from various sites if the hiker has been following the correct path the compass corrected true indicated bearing should closely correspond to the true bearing previously obtained from the map a compass should be laid down on a level surface so that the needle only rests or hangs on the bearing fused to the compass casing – if used at a tilt the needle might touch the casing on the compass and not move freely hence not pointing to the magnetic north accurately giving a faulty reading to see if the needle is well leveled look closely at the needle and tilt it slightly to see if the needle is swaying side to side freely and the needle is not contacting the casing of the compass if the needle tilts to one direction tilt the compass slightly and gently to the opposing direction until the compass needle is horizontal lengthwise items to avoid around compasses are magnets of any kind and any electronics magnetic fields from electronics can easily disrupt the needle preventing it from aligning with the earths magnetic fields causing inaccurate readings the earths natural magnetic forces are considerably weak measuring at 05 gauss and magnetic fields from household electronics can easily exceed it overpowering the compass needle exposure to strong magnets or magnetic interference can sometimes cause the magnetic poles of the compass needle to differ or even reverse avoid iron rich deposits when using a compass for example certain rocks which contain magnetic minerals like magnetite this is often indicated by a rock with a surface which is dark and has a metallic luster not all magnetic mineral bearing rocks have this indication to see if a rock or an area is causing interference on a compass get out of the area and see if the needle on the compass moves if it does it means that the area or rock the compass was previously at is causing interference and should be avoided see also  editabsolute bearing aircraft
