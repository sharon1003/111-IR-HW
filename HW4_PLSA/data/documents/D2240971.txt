will have to incur costs but i set my own budget and let the bride know in advance what i am able to do and what i am not i am in control of my own party as it should be i let her know here is what i can do and she either agrees or not if she does not then i can bow out however we do not have to be extravagant to enjoy each others company with some flowers from the market at 5 per bouquet and good
