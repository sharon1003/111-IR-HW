gremlins roger ebert june 8 1984  3print page tweetgremlins is a confrontation between norman rockwells vision of christmas and hollywoods vision of the bloodsucking monkeys of voodoo island its fun on the one hand you have an idyllic american small town with burger kings and sears stores clustered merrily around the village square and on the other hand you have a plague of reprehensible little beasties who behave like a rodent road company of marlon brandos motorcycle gang in the wild one the whole movie is a sly series of sendups inspired by movie scenes so basic they reside permanently in our subconscious the opening scene for example involves a visit to your basic mysterious little shop in chinatown where as we all know the ordinary rules of the visible universe cease to operate and magic is a reality later on after a kids father buys him a cute little gremlin in chinatown we have a new version of your basic puppy for christmas scene then there are such basic movie characters as the zany inventor the blustering sheriff the cleancut kid the cute girlfriend and of course the old bag advertisement the first half of the movie is the best thats when we meet the little gremlins which are unbearably cute and look like a cross between a pekingese yoda from  the empire strikes back  the ewoks from  return of the jedi  and kittens they have impossibly big eyes theyre cuddly and friendly and they would make ideal pets except for the fact that they hate bright lights should not be allowed to get wet and must never be fed after midnight well of course its always after midnight thats the tipoff that this isnt a retread of  e t the extraterrestrial  but comes from an older tradition the fairy tale or magic story and in the second half of the movie after the gremlins have gotten wet been fed after midnight etc they turn into truly hateful creatures that look like the monster in  alien  the movie exploits every trick in the monstermovie book we have scenes where monsters pop up in the foreground and others where they stalk us in the background and others when they drop into the frame and scare the shinola out of everybody and the movie itself turns nasty especially in a scene involving a monster that gets slammed in a microwave oven and another one where a wideeyed teenage girl  phoebe cates explains why she hates christmas her story is in the great tradition of 1950s sick jokes and as for the microwave scene i had a queasy feeling that before long wed be reading newspaper stories about kids who went home and tried the same thing with the family cat gremlins was hailed as another e t its not its in a different tradition at the level of serious film criticism its a meditation on the myths in our movies christmas families monsters retail stores movies boogeymen at the level of pop moviegoing its a sophisticated witty b movie in which the monsters are devouring not only the defenseless town but decades of defenseless clichés but dont go if
