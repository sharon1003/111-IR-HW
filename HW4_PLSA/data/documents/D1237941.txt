chris dea 5 contributions what characteristics do solid ionic compounds share in general they are hard brittle crystals that have high melting points when they are dissolved they can conduct electricity what are the five characteristics of ionic compounds typical ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points little to no conductivity when solid and good solubility in polar solvents eg water quirkyquantummechanic 136139 contributions why are solid ionic compounds nonconductors because in solid form the ions that comprise the compound are localised stuck in ionic bonds and cannot move freely when they are molten or are in solution the ions are …doctorwhofanx d 8 contributions what are the characteristic of most ionic compounds high boilingmelting points very hard they can conduct electricity when molten or dissolved explanation high boilingmelting points  they form lattices held together by …cmcnaught 3070 contributions what is a characteristic of most ionic compounds the form positive and negative ions when they dissolve in water  they conduct electricity in their molten state  they conduct electricity when dissolved in water  they a …characteristic property of ionic compounds1 ionic compounds are neutral as a whole although they are formed by the oppositely charged ions 2 they have very high melting and boiling points 3 in …wxyz9357 97 contributions what is the characteristic property of ionic compoundsthey are metals not pure metals like copper or iron like salt they are a crystalline structure wasifbullo 22 contributions why ionic compound are hard solid because the bonding of the molecules is strongso thats why they are hard solids regards wasif waliullah bullo what characteristics do solids ionic compounds share in general they are hard brittle crystals that have high melting points when they are dissolved they can conduct electricity gamerfantasy 240 contributions why ionic compounds are in solid state they are held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction is ionic compound a solid an ionic compound is any compound in which some of the atoms gain or lose electrons to form ions and it has no specific state solid liquid gas so the short answer is no …are all ionic compounds solidyes
