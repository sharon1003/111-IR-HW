radioactivity well log that records natural radioactivity around the wellbore shales generally produce higher levels of gamma radiation and can be detected and studied with the gamma ray tool see radioactivity well logginggas anchorn a tubular perforated device attached to the bottom of a suckerrod pump that helps to prevent gas lock the device works on the principle that gas being lighter than oil rises as well fluids enter the anchor gas breaks out of the fluid and exits from the anchor through perforations near the top remaining fluids enter the pump through a mosquito bill a tube within the anchor which has an opening near the bottom in this way all or most of the gas escapes before the fluids enter the pumpgas capn a freegas phase overlying an oil zone and occurring within the same producing formation as the oil see reservoirgascap driven drive energy supplied naturally as a reservoir is produced by the expansion of the gas cap in such a drive the gas cap expands to force oil into the well and to the surface see reservoir drive mechanismgascut mudn a drilling mud that contains entrained formation gas giving the mud a characteristically fluffy texture gas cut mud may cause a lowering of mud weightgas driven the use of the energy that arises from the expansion of compressed gas in a reservoir to move crude oil to a wellbore also called depletion drive see dissolvedgas drive gascap drive reservoir drive mechanismgas injectionn the injection of gas into a reservoir to maintain formation pressure by gas drive and to reduce the rate of decline of the original reservoir drive one type of gas injection uses gas that does not mix is not miscible with the oil examples of these gases include natural gas nitrogen and flue gas another type uses gas that does mix is miscible with the oil the gas may be naturally miscible or become miscible under high pressure examples of miscible gases include propane methane enriched with other light hydrocarbons methane under high pressure and carbon dioxide under pressure frequently water is also injected in alternating steps with the gasgas injection welln a well into which gas is injected for the purpose of maintaining or supplementing pressure in an oil reservoirgasketn any material such as paper cork asbestos stainless steel or other types of metal or rubber used to seal two essentially stationary surfacesgas liftn the process of raising or lifting fluid from a well by injecting gas down the well through tubing or through the tubingcasing annulus injected gas aerates the fluid to make it exert less pressure than the formation does the resulting higher formation pressure forces the fluid out of the wellbore gas may be injected continuously or intermittently depending on the producing characteristics of the well and the arrangement of the gaslift equipmentgaslift mandreln a device installed in the tubing string of a gaslift well onto which or into which a gaslift valve is fitted there are two common types of mandrel in the conventional gaslift mandrel the gaslift valve is installed as the tubing is placed in the well thus to replace or repair the valve the tubing string must be pulled in the sidepocket mandrel however the valve is installed and removed by wireline while the mandrel is still in the well eliminating the need to pull the tubing to repair or replace the valvegaslift valven a device installed on a gaslift mandrel which in turn is put on the tubing string of a gaslift well tubing and casing pressures cause the valve to open and close thus allowing gas to be injected into the fluid in the tubing to cause the fluid to rise to the surface see gaslift mandrelgaslift welln a well in which reservoir fluids are artificially lifted by the injection of gasgas lockn 1 a condition sometimes encountered in a pumping well when dissolved gas released from solution during the upstroke of the plunger appears as free gas between the valves if the gas pressure is sufficient the standing valve is locked shut and no fluid enters the tubing 2 a device fitted to the gauging hatch on a pressure tank that enables manual dipping and sampling without loss of vapor 3 a condition that can occur when gascut mud is circulated by the mud pump the gas breaks out of the mud expands and works against the operation of the piston and valvesgas welln a well that primarily produces gas legal definitions vary among the statesgear reducern see speed reducergeln a semisolid jellylike state assumed by some colloidal dispersions at restgeologistn a scientist who gathers and interprets data pertaining to the formations of the earth’s crust geronimon see safety slidego in the holev to lower the drill stem the tubing the casing or the sucker rods into the wellboregone to wateradj pertaining to a well in which production of oil has decreased and production of water has increased for example “the well has gone to water”gooseneckn the curved connection between the rotary hose and the swivel see swivelgraveln sand or glass beads of uniform size and roundness used in gravel packinggravel packingn a method of well completion in which a slotted or perforated liner often wirewrapped is placed in the well and surrounded by gravel if open hole the well is sometimes enlarged by underreaming at the point where the gravel is packed the mass of gravel excludes sand from the wellbore but allows continued productionguide shoen 1 a short heavy cylindrical section of steel filled with concrete and rounded at the bottom which is placed at the end of the casing string it prevents the casing from snagging on irregularities in the borehole as it is loweredguy line anchorn a buried weight or anchor to which a guy line is attachedguy wiren a rope or cable
