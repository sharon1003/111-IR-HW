developing a monitoring  evaluation plan a monitoring and evaluation me plan is a guide as to what you should evaluate what information you need and who you are evaluating for the plan outlines the key evaluation questions and the detailed monitoring questions that help answer the evaluation questions this allows you to identify the information you need to collect and how you can collect it depending on the detail of the me plan you can identify the people responsible for different tasks as well as timelines the plan should be able to be picked up by anyone involved in the project at anytime and be clear as to what is happening in terms of monitoring and evaluation it is also important to remember that there are many types of evaluation an evaluation plan should ideally be done at the planning stage of a project before you commence implementation this will allow you to plan ahead of time and data collection activities that you may need to undertake such as preintervention surveys however it is never too late to develop an me plan retrofitting an me plan to an existing project may just mean that you may be constrained in some of the data that you can collect how to develop a monitoring and evaluation plan a short tutorial on how to develop a me plan  opens up in power point step 1 identify your evaluation audience identify who the evaluation audience or stakeholders are the evaluation audience include the people or organisations that require an evaluation to be conducted there may be multiple audiences each with their own requirements typically this includes the funding agency and may also include partner organisations the council or councillors the project team and the project’s participants or target group remember that evaluation is generally undertaken for accountability or learning and preferably both together if you have limited funds for evaluation you may have to prioritise your evaluation by identifying who are the most important people to report to download me audience and evaluation questions template step 2 define the evaluation questions evaluation questions should be developed upfront and in collaboration with the primary audience s and other stakeholders who you intend to report to evaluation questions go beyond measurements to ask the higher order questions such as whether the intervention is worth it or could if have been achieved in another way see examples below overall evaluation questions should lead to further action such as project improvement project mainstreaming or project redesign you should also identify at this stage whether the evaluation audience has specific timelines by which it requires an evaluation report this will be a major factor in deciding what you can and cannot collect when framing your outcomefocussed evaluation questions keep them openended eg  to what extent did broad types of evaluation questions by focus area adapted from davidson  wehipeihana 2010focus of evaluation evaluation question process how well was the project designed and implemented ie its qualityoutcome to what extent did the project meet the overall needs was there any significant change and to what extent was it attributable to the project how valuable are the outcomes to the organisation other stakeholders and participants learnings what worked and what did not what were unintended consequences what were emergent properties investment was the project cost effective was there another alternative that may have represented a better investment what next can the project be scaled up can the project be replicated elsewhere is the change selfsustaining or does it require continued intervention theory of change does the project have a theory of change is the theory of change reflected in the program logic how can the program logic inform the research questions another way of classifying broad evaluation questions is presented below adapted from europe aid cooperation office focus of evaluation evaluation question relevance does the workshop topic and contents meet the information needs of the target group to what extent is the intervention goal in line with the needs and priorities of the community efficiency did the engagement method used in this project lead to similar numbers of participants as previous or other programs at a comparable or lesser cost have the more expensive engagement approaches led to better results than the less expensive engagement approaches effectiveness to what extent did the workshops lead to increased community support for action to tackle climate change to what extent was did the engagement method encourage the target group to take part in the project outcome to what extent has the project led to more sustainable behaviours in the target group were there any other unintended positive or negative outcomes from the project sustainability to what extent has the project led to the longterm behaviour change step 3 identify the monitoring questions in order to answer evaluation questions monitoring questions must be developed that will inform what data will be collected through the monitoring process monitoring questions are quite specific in what they ask compared to evaluation questions for example for an evaluation question of  what worked and what did not  you may have several specific questions such as  did the workshops lead to increased knowledge on energy efficiency in the home or did participants install water efficient showerheads  the monitoring questions will ideally be answered through the collection of quantitative and qualitative data it is important to not leap straight into the collection of data without thinking about the evaluation questions jumping straight in may lead to collecting data that provides no useful information which is a waste of time and money download the me plan template to input the information or download a partically completed me plan template that includes sample evaluation questions monitoring questions indicators and sources for a kerbside recyclling education project if you have developed a program logic you can use this to start identifying relevant monitoring questions and indicators click here to see how once you have identified monitoring question in your program logic you can transfer them into your me plan template click here to see how a short tutorial on how to extract information from your program logic to develop your me plan  opens up in power point step 4 identify the indicators and data sources the next step is to identify what information you need to answer your monitoring questions indicators and where this information will come from data sources it is important to consider data collection in terms of the type of data and any types of research design data sources could be participant themselves or people’s homes eg audit of lighting types or metering or even literature you can then decide on the most appropriate method to collect the data from the data source the evaluation tool selector is there to assist you in selecting an appropriate method for your needs it is important to ensure that your evaluation framework is culturally appropriate when working with culturall and linguistically diverse cald communities consider involving community representatives or cultural experts in the evaluation framework to ensure that data collection methods are appropriate sensitive and understood to the target group for further reading look at the genuine evaluation blog step 5 identify who is responsible for data collection and timelines it is advisable to assign responsibility for the data collection so that everyone is clear of their roles and responsibilities this also allows new staff to come onto the project and get a sense of who is responsible for what and what they may have to take on and when collection of monitoring data may occur regularly over short intervals or less regularly such as halfyearly or annually again assigning timelines limits the excuse of ‘not knowing’ you may also want to note any requirements that are needed to collect the data staff budget etc it is advisable to have some idea of the cost associated with monitoring as you may have great ideas to collect a lot of information only to find out that you cannot afford it all in such a case you will have to either prioritise or find some money elsewhere sorry but we have no special tool for that step 6 identify who will evaluate the data how it will be reported and when this step is optional but highly recommended as it will round off the me plan as a complete document remembering that evaluation is the subjective assessment of a project’s worth it is important to identify who will be making this ‘subjective assessment’ in most cases it will be the project team but in some cases you may involve other stakeholders including the target group or participants you may also consider outsourcing a particular part of the evaluation to an external or independent party for an evaluation to be used and therefore useful it is important to present the findings in a format that is appropriate to the audience this may mean a short report or a memo or even a poster or newsletter as such it is recommended that you consider how you will present your evaluation from the start so that you can tailor the way to present your findings to the presentation format such as graphs tables text images step 7 review the me plan once you have completed your me plan highlight data sources that appear frequently for example you may be able to develop surveys that fulfil the data collection requirements for many questions also consider reordering the me plan in several ways for example by data source or by data collection timeframe finally go through this checklist does your me plan focus on the key evaluation questions and the evaluation audience capture all that you need to know in order to make a meaningful evaluation of the project only asks relevant monitoring questions and avoids the collection of unnecessary data know how data will be analysed used and reported work within your budget and other resources identify the skills required to conduct the data collection and analysis links  further resources department of planning and community development vic evaluation stepbystep
