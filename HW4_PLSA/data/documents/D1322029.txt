sewer photo via craftsy member schlosser designs sewing tables are an individual preference what works for one person might not work for another and it’s largely dependent on your height ideally you will have two sewing tables one set up for using your sewing machine and another set up for cutting fabric here are 5 tips to keep in mind when searching for a sewing table1 your sewing machine table should keep your work at elbow height and your wrists straight if the table is too low it will cause you to hunch forward straining your back neck and shoulders if the table is too high you’ll have to raise your shoulders to work which will tire your neck shoulders and upper back the work surface should be large enough to comfortably fit your machine as well as any task lighting you need the table should also have enough room over your thighs for you to comfortably work the foot pedal without the table pressing on your legs2 be sure to also consider the chair you use at your sewing table your feet should rest flat on the floor and the work surface should still be at elbow height an adjustable height chair can help you get the perfect fit the same principles apply for a cutting table — your work should be at elbow height when you are standing3 consider the type of work you usually do to find a good width for your table since you don’t want to be bending over to make your cuts a sewist who sews a lot of fulllength ball gowns will want a wider sewing table than one who sticks to children’s clothes4 find a sewing table that best suits your height since everyone’s elbow height is a bit different it’s a great idea to have your sewing tables custommade this is especially true if you are particularly tall or short if that’s not an option see what’s available at your nearest craft store but don’t stop there many regular tables can make great sewing or cutting tables even if they weren’t originally intended for that purpose my sewing machine sits on a small square kitchen table scour garage sales and thrift stores if you’re looking to furnish your sewing room on a budget be sure to take a tape measure with you when shopping to make sure everything will fit5 if a table is almost perfect but not quite see if a simple adjustment would make it work for you can you cut the legs down to make it an appropriate height use wooden or cinder blocks to raise the table height a little bit these are easy solutions that can result in proper ergonomics now that you have your sewing table properly set up why not make a cute sewing machine apron like the one featured above to keep your tools close at hand looking for further suggestions on outfitting your sewing room take a look at our article sewing room tips come back to the craftsy blog tomorrow for tips on how to drape fabric on a dress form do you have a sewing table you love tell me about it in the comments10 comments sue ramsden september 12th 2013my cutting out table is an old office desk – it was too low but is now the right height after i put it on bedchair risers bought from a disability website reply barbara september 12th 2013my cutting table is two folding tables placed together with inexpensive bed risers under the legs it is the perfect height for me my sewing room is very small and i do not keep the cutting tables up at all times and the tables are used for many other things such as buffets as well i find that a adjustable quality ergonomic chair for the machine is just as important as the height of the sewing table if i am doing close work i raise the seat so i can have a closer view and the reverse for long straight sewing such as drapery or soft furnishing reply angela fassett september 15th 2013i bought a folding table that was adjustable but it was still either to tall or to short had my husband drill new holes in the metal leg to the correct height works great this is for my sewing machine reply rose september 30th 2013i don’t understand what you mean regarding elbow height for a sewing table is elbow height when you are sitting in a chair or standing to cut fabric i am just beginning to set up a sewing room and to purchase a table for the room thanksreply ritz october 18th

awarenessso i would like to aware that how to apply these ergonomics applications to sewing industry with heavy working rush reply jonathan february 26th 2016great info yes the height could be a problem if not at the best position for ergonomics however even tables with flexible height would help but not completely eliminate the problems you face i saw a sewing table list and recommendation on the link below very nice options and suggestion httpbestsewingmachinereviewspotcombestsewingmachinetablescabinet i personally like the tdm sewing  craft center – foldable because its like a normal table and has some cabinate with it after use everything goes… you can have a lamp on it and totally transformed to another home table nice color i am looking at buying one julia do you have any suggestion if you buy a sewing table you need to measure your height and distance to your elbow and choose the one with approximately this height for adjustable ones you hardly get a really perfect ones most are usually not very good at least i have not seen much also to get into the job you really need to get used to a particular height for sewing table used by more than one person then i will recommend adjustable tablebut as julia said if you get non adjustable one it could still be worked onto your desired height replysewing machines march 30th 2016this is great for a beginner i will refer this to my students as well thanks reply madison finch july 27th 2017thank for giving these advanced awarenessso i would like to aware that how to apply these ergonomics applications to sewing industry with heavy working rush what you think about brother xm2701  reply pain in the neck march 22nd 2018my table is at about elbow height but my machine is not floating below the top so my hands are not at elbow height when sewing i always assumed it was me hunching down to see what i am doing at such a low position that was causing my problems…as your head puts about 60 lbs of pressure on the shoulders and back when tipped forward according to my physical therapist however if your point is that where your hands are positioned when sewing or cutting should be at elbow height then my table needs to be lowered by the distance between the tabletop and the height of my needle plate doesn’t it i’m looking at my keyboard tray at elbow height…and if i were sewing on it my shoulders would definitely be liftedreply leave a reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website leave a reply
