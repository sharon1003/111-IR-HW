home about evangelical how did jesus pray according to the bible june 23 2014 by jack wellman 21 comments how did jesus pray what was his customary style when he did pray what can we learn from jesus’ example of praying a man of prayer jesus was a man of prayer and often prayed all night and did so in privacy usually going up a mountain and in privacy instead of my telling you how jesus prayed why not let the scriptures themselves reveal how jesus prayed because i am human and am highly prone and subject to error if it’s in the bible we know its right therefore here are some scriptures about how jesus prayed with commentary about how we can apply this to our own prayer life jesus prayed on the ground matthew 2639 “and going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed saying “my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as you will”here is the lord god who is both man and god yet “he fell on his face and prayed” before the father in a great sign of humility and reverent submission i believe that is the best of all possible positions to pray because it is a form of reverence respect honor and fear in falling before our god in prayer if jesus did so how much more do we need to do the same jesus prayed for god’s will matthew 2642 “my father if this cannot pass unless i drink it your will be done”when we pray we must pray according to the will of god and that is what jesus taught the disciples how to pray when they asked him how they were to pray saying “your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” matt 610 is god’s will being done in heaven no doubt it is because can you imagine if god wills something in heaven and it is not immediately done of course not that is why we should pray for his will to be done “on earth as it is already being being done in heaven” jesus prayed for god’s will even if it meant drinking the cup with which jesus drank for our sake jesus hallowed god’s name matthew 69 “our father in heaven hallowed be your name”when jesus prayed “hallowed be your name” he was essentially saying “let your name be kept holy let your name be treated with reverence” because his name is holy and that is why god takes it so seriously when his righteous name is blasphemed jesus prayed in privacy and solitary places mark 135 “and rising very early in the morning while it was still dark he departed and went out to a desolate place and there he prayed”jesus’ custom was to rise early while it was still dark and then go to a solitary place that was both isolated and private luke 516 we ought to pray in a similar fashion and go into our “prayer closet” or any other place where we can find privacy because it’s harder to pray to impress people if it is just us and god jesus prayed first thing in the morning mark 135a “and rising very early in the morning while it was still dark”i realize that i am referencing the same verse but i didn’t want to miss out on the fact that jesus’ custom was to rise early and it was so early that it was still dark this too would ensure that it was private but i want to point out the fact that jesus started his day off with prayer and so should we i can remember the days that i skipped my morning prayers and lived to regret it jesus prayed for others john 179 11b “i am praying for them i am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me for they are yours holy father keep them in your name which you have given me that they may be one even as we are one”jesus was consistently praying for his disciples and so we should be praying for others too that means we should pray for the other members of the body of christ the church and praying for the lost that they might be saved i try to make it my pattern to pray for god’s glory first for others next and then me last god loves the humility of those who put others first above their own interests or needs jesus says pray for our enemies matthew 54445 “i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust”this might be the hardest thing to pray for that there is jesus commands us in the beatitudes to pray for our enemies and for those who persecute us “so that or in order that we may be sons of our father” why because god “makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust” and remember that we too were once his enemies rom 510 conclusion jesus tells us that we should pray in privacy that we should pray first thing in the morning that we should pray for god’s will above our own that we should pray in a position of humility that we should pray for others first and that we should pray even for those who hate us because we were all once godhaters before we repented confessed our sins and put our trust in the savior my prayer as i am writing this is that you will know jesus christ and that you might be saved another reading on patheos to check out what did jesus really look like a look at the bible facts article by jack wellman jack wellman is

it out in islam his actual message can not be found in any of christian denominations  all of them in conflict with one an other jesus was nothing but a humble a servant and messenger a human being and a creation of god is it not hypocritical to teach that jesus prayed to god and at the same time say jesus was godexplore islam and find the correct answer you will not find real jesus in any of denominations  catholic protestant baptist methodist pentecostal eastern orthodoxy anglican jehovah witness mormon evangelical 7th day presbyterian greek orthodox african zionist reformed

me  prayed for help from a being greater than himself3 nevertheless not as i will but as you will  as the muslims say  inshaallah one single passage completely destroying the false concept of jesus being god or even a part of god jack wellman • 10 months ago it actually reaffirms his part in the trinity matt 281820 guest • 3 years ago jesus christ peace be upon him prayed like a muslim  muslims bow down and pray and they pray early morning which also known as dawn jesus christ pbuh never ate pork he ate kosher which food is similar to halal food jesus was circumcised like muslims jesus lifestyle was a like muslim muslim means submitting your will to almighty god which jesus christ pbuh did and he said to follow to last messenger muhammed pbuh john chapter 12 verses 13 14 “i still have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now when the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth for he will not speak on his own authority but whatever he hears he will speak and he will declare to you the things that are to come jesus is talking about the coming of muhammed pbuh why did jesus say this because he didnt finish his message thats why he said this john chapter 15 verse 26 “but when the helper comes whom i will send to you from the father the spirit of truth who proceeds from the father he will bear witness about me so if you believe in jesus christ pbuh then you have to follow the last and final messenger from almighty god sent muhammed pbuh and the last testament which is the holy quran which is the last revelation from almighty god which we call allah  means one true god in arabic quran hasnt been changed since it was revealed over 1400 years ago there is not a single statement that contridicts modern established science quran says why where we created purpose of life so please read the quran just read it inshallah if god wills in arabic guest • 3 years ago islam is blasphemy jack wellman • 3 years ago i agree guestthe muslim jesus is not the one of the bible for he is only a prophet to them instead of god who died for them the helper that is to come was the holy spirit and the spirit came to glorify and point lost men and women

years ago also “but when the helper comes whom i will send to you from the father the spirit of truth who proceeds from the father he will bear witness about me   muhammed did not bear witness about me he didnt speak about jesus muslims do not even believe that jesus died and was resurrected so there is no way that jesus was talking about muhammed why would jesus speak of someone who denied his biggest mission john 1426 says the helper the holy spirit that my father will sendjack wellman • 3 years ago amenthey have the wrong jesus and they need the right jesus to have their sins forgiven and covered thanks debsmhmmd123 • 3 years ago debs here is your answer4 how the ‘gospel of barnabas’ contradicts the teachings of islam though the ‘gospel of barnabas’ supports the teachings of islam in many ways there are a few rare occasions when it does nota the messiah  jesus or muhammad in john 120 injil john the baptist denies that he is the messiah the ‘gospel of barnabas’ however makes jesus deny the same thing in much the same words jesus confessed and said the truth “i am not the messiah i am indeed sent to the house of israel as a prophet of salvation but after me shall come the messiah” paras42 82 then said the priest “how shall the messiah be called”  jesus answered « muhammad is his blessed name » para97mhmmd123 • 3 years ago jack wellman how do you explain this4 how the
