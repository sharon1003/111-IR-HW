exclusive lost city discovered in the honduran rain forest in search for the legendary “city of the monkey god” explorers find the untouched ruins of a vanished culture a “werejaguar” effigy likely representing a combination of a human and spirit animal is part of a stillburied ceremonial seat or metate one of many artifacts discovered in a cache in ruins deep in the honduran jungle by douglas preston photographs by dave yoder published march 2 2015an expedition to honduras has emerged from the jungle with dramatic news of the discovery of a mysterious culture’s lost city never before explored the team was led to the remote uninhabited region by longstanding rumors that it was the site of a storied “white city” also referred to in legend as the “city of the monkey god”archaeologists surveyed and mapped extensive plazas earthworks mounds and an earthen pyramid belonging to a culture that thrived a thousand years ago and then vanished the team which returned from the site last wednesday also discovered a remarkable cache of stone sculptures that had lain untouched since the city was abandoned1  3honduran troops lead a convoy through a town that served as the base for helicopters ferrying members of the expedition to a location in the mosquitia rain forest where they examined ruins of an ancient city photograph by dave yoder national geographic former

rumored to contain a legendary “white city” also called the city of the monkey god photograph by dave yoder national geographic in contrast to the nearby maya this vanished culture has been scarcely studied and it remains virtually unknown archaeologists don’t even have a name for it christopher fisher a mesoamerican archaeologist on the team from colorado state university said the pristine unlooted condition of the site was “incredibly rare” he speculated that the cache found at the base of the pyramid may have been an offering“the undisturbed context is unique” fisher said “this is a powerful ritual display to take wealth objects like this out of circulation”the tops of 52 artifacts were peeking from the earth many more evidently lie below ground with possible burials they include stone ceremonial seats called metates and finely carved vessels decorated with snakes zoomorphic figures and vultures related content archaeologists stumble across a hoard of gold embracing stone age couple found in greek cave see photos of a mayan city unearthed in 2009the most striking object emerging from the ground is the head of what fisher speculated might be “a werejaguar” possibly depicting a shaman in a transformed spirit state alternatively the artifact might be related to ritualized ball games that were a feature of precolumbian life in mesoamerica“the figure seems to be wearing a helmet” said fisher team member oscar neil cruz head archaeologist at the honduran institute of anthropology and history ihah believes the artifacts date to a d 1000 to 1400 the objects were documented but left unexcavated to protect the site from looters its location is not being revealed stories of “casa blanca” and a monkey god the ruins were first identified in may 2012 during an aerial survey of a remote valley in la mosquitia a vast region of swamps rivers and mountains containing some of the last scientifically unexplored places on earth for a hundred years explorers and prospectors told tales of the white ramparts of a lost city glimpsed above the jungle foliage indigenous stories speak of a “white house” or a “place of cacao” where indians took refuge from spanish conquistadores—a mystical edenlike paradise from which no one ever returned1  4former british sas soldier andrew wood hacks through thick foliage to clear a way for scientists to investigate an archaeological site first identified using an aerial imaging technology called lidar photograph by dave yoder national geographic archaeologist oscar neil cruz of the honduran institute of anthropology and history examines a building stone discovered during a foray to a location identified by lidar as a place of interest several such construction stones apparently shaped by hand were found in a row at the top of what appears to be an ancient plaza photograph by dave yoder national geographic former british sas commando steve “sully” sullivan right waits while the scientific team puzzles over a construction stone that they believe was carved by members of a vanished civilization yet to be identified photograph by dave yoder national geographic frequent rains turned the expedition camp into a sea of mud photograph by dave yoder national geographic since the 1920s several expeditions had searched for the white city or ciudad blanca the eccentric explorer theodore morde mounted the most famous of these in 1940 under the aegis of the museum of the american indian now part of the smithsonian institution  morde returned from mosquitia with thousands of artifacts claiming to have entered the city according to morde the indigenous people there said it contained a giant buried statue of a monkey god he refused to divulge the location out of fear he said that the site would be looted he later committed suicide and his site—if it existed at all—was never identified more recently documentary filmmakers steve elkins and bill benenson launched a search for the lost city they identified a cratershaped valley encircled by steep mountains as a possible location to survey it in 2012 they enlisted the help of the center for airborne laser mapping at the university of houston a cessna skymaster carrying a milliondollar lidar scanner flew over the valley probing the jungle canopy with laser light lidar is able to map the ground even through dense rain forest delineating any archaeological features that might be present when the images were processed they revealed unnatural features stretching for more than a mile through the valley when fisher analyzed the images he found that the terrain along the river had been almost entirely reshaped by human hands the evidence of public and ceremonial architecture giant earthworks and house mounds possible irrigation canals and reservoirs all led fisher to conclude that the settlement was indeed a precolumbian city threatened by deforestation an archaeological discovery isn’t confirmed until it has been “groundtruthed” the ground exploration team consisted of american and honduran archaeologists a lidar engineer an anthropologist an ethnobotanist documentary filmmakers and support personnel sixteen honduran special forces soldiers provided security the national geographic society sent a photographer and a writer the expedition confirmed on the ground all the features seen in the lidar images along with much more it was indeed an ancient city archaeologists however no longer believe in the existence of a single “lost city” or ciudad blanca as described in the legends they believe mosquitia harbors many such “lost cities” which taken together represent something far more important—a lost civilization left anna cohen a university of washington anthropology grad student documents a cache of more than 50 artifacts discovered in the jungle following scientific protocol no objects were removed from the site the scientists hope to mount an expedition soon to further document and excavate the site before it can be found by looters right in addition to looting another threat to the newly discovered ruins is deforestation for cattle ranching seen here on a hillside on the way to the site at its present pace deforestation could reach the site within a few years photograph by dave yoder national geographic the valley is densely carpeted in a rain forest so primeval that the animals appear never to have seen humans before an advance team clearing a landing zone for helicopters supplying the expedition noted spider monkeys peering down curiously from the trees above and guinea hen and a tapir wandering into camp unafraid of the human visitors“this is clearly the most undisturbed rain forest in central america” said the expedition’s ethnobotanist mark plotkin who spent 30 years in amazonia “the importance of this place can’t be overestimated”the region also is gravely threatened deforestation for ranching has checkerboarded the jungle to within a dozen miles of the valley huge swaths of virgin rain forest are being cut illegally and burned to make way for cattle the region has become one of the biggest beefproducing areas in central america supplying meat to fastfood franchises in the united states this is clearly the most undisturbed rain forest in central america the importance of this place can’t be overestimated mark plotkin ethnobotanist virgilio paredes trapero the director of the ihah under whose auspices the expedition operated spent several days at the site he concluded “if we don’t do something right away most of this forest and valley will be gone in eight years” he spread his hands “the honduran government is committed to protecting this area but doesn’t have the money we urgently need international support”the expedition was made possible with the permission partnership and support of the government of honduras honduran president juan orlando hernández avarado virgilio paredes trapero director of the honduran institute for
