upliftingthe geologic history of the ozarks is so complex and vast that geologists explain the forces that gave rise to the uplift in terms of theories rather than facts it is widely accepted however that the formation of the ozark mountains began during the latter part of the precambrian period between 165 and 1 billion years ago in the 19th century geologists were unable to locate fossils earlier than those found in cambria wales which dated to 600 million years ago anything older than the fossils in wales were described as precambrian thanks to softbodied fossils found in australia and canada evidence is conclusive that life began almost three billion years earlier than the cambrian period formation of the ozarks began when north america was still located south of the equator in the precambrian period a combination of outpourings of lava from volcanoes layers of ash and cinders piled up eventually forming the base of the ozarks over the course of 500 million years volcanic eruptions below the surface caused blisterlike projections to rise up out of the sea the lava floes created a small chain of islands in the primordial sea these ancient igneous rocks formed the st francois mountains the core of the modern ozarks after millions of years of volcanic activity the molten rocks of the st francois mountains may have been as tall as 10000 feet above the ocean floor although no more than a mile or so above the water level the strong forces of continental drift had not yet formed the supercontinent pangaea but the drifting was directly impacting the formation of the rest of the ozarks causing a bending of the ocean floor raising the seafloor almost above the water by the end of the cambrian period the st francois mountains were balmy desert islands much like the galapagos the rest of the ozarks were still forming under the sea about 520 million years ago the earths crust warped causing successive rising and falling sea levels during this period several layers of sediments were deposited and quickly eroded leaving behind carbonate and sandstone deposits on the ocean floor finally by the beginning of the ordovician period a major uplift related to previous volcanic activity and continental shifting brought the ozarks out of the sea at the same time the northern and central appalachians were forming some geologists link the burgeoning mountain ranges to the same continental collisions nevertheless and regardless of similarities today the ozarks were still in the tropics during the ordovician period the fossil record shows snails crustaceans and other marine life from this period all creatures of limestonebased mud in its infancy based on geologic records and careful speculation the ozark mountains may have been as tall as the himalayas the erosive forces that began in the silurian period 440410 million years ago formed rivers and streams many cutting deeply through the ordovician bedrock sea levels changed once again as early as 360 million years ago during the mississippian period placing the ozarks underwater so on top of the ordovician layers limestonebased muds and sandstone layers were deposited meanwhile the appalachians continued to grow as plates collided back east the ozarks on the other hand grew thanks to the addition of new sediment layers finally fast forward to the cretaceous period 14665 million years ago shifting plates caused the ozarks to uplift one last time sending torrents of recent sediments and gravels into southeast missouri since the last major uplift the erosive forces of wind and rain have weathered this ancient mountain range leaving behind an easily accessible stunning timeline of missouris geologic history the ozarks are separated into four distinct ecoregions the salem plateau dominated by sedimentary rocks like limestone dolomite and sandstone the springfield plateau represented best by rolling hills and vast stretches of prairie the boston mountains of arkansas and the st francois mountains composed of rhyolite granite and basalt posted by allison vaughn at 920 pmno comments post a comment
