instructor darla reed darla has taught undergraduate enzyme kinetics and has a doctorate in basic medical science in this lesson you will discover what carbon fixation means when it occurs and what enzyme is involved the lesson will discuss where the process of carbon fixation falls in photosynthesis as well as give a brief idea of a process by which carbon can be freed from fixation what is carbon fixation what does it mean to fix something it can mean to repair something thats broken like fixing a car or a bike but thats not the only meaning you can fix something in place if you take a thumb tack or push pin and put a piece of paper on a bulletin board it fixes the piece of paper so that it wont fall off carbon fixation is a process that involves fixing a carbon into place just like you take that piece of paper and tack it to the bulletin board so that it wont float around or end up on the floor plants want to take carbon dioxide co2 out of the air and tack it to carbohydrates so its not floating around all over the place the process of taking inorganic carbon usually co2 and tacking it to an organic molecule usually a carbohydrate is known as carbon fixation carbon fixation the calvin cycle so how exactly do plants go about taking the inorganic co2 and tacking it onto a carbohydrate this process of carbon fixation is actually the first step in the calvin cycle also known as the carbon fixation cycle or c3 cycle the first thing the cell needs is a molecule called ribulose15bisphosphate or ru bp for short ru bp structure the next thing the cell needs is a special enzyme enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions the enzyme the cell needs for carbon fixation is called ribulose15bisphosphate carboxylase ribulose15bisphosphate carboxylase is quite a mouthful so its often shortened to ru bis co ru bis co is an enzyme ru bis co is responsible for fixing the carbon rather like you are responsible for tacking the paper onto the bulletin board however this enzyme works so slowly in cellular terms that plants need a whole lot of it in order to fix enough carbon for its needs because plants contain so much of this enzyme it could be in the guinness book of world records as earths most abundant enzymewith ru bp co2 and ru bis co the plant cell is ready to fix carbon ru bis co takes the co2 and adds it to the ru bp creating a temporary intermediate molecule ru bis co takes ru bp and co2 and forms an intermediate after the intermediate is formed the whole molecule is separated into two 3carbon molecules hence the name c3 cycle called 3phosphoglycerate 3pg an equation for the reaction might look something like this ru bp  co2  2 3pg carbon fixation forms 2 3pg molecules the 3pg is made into glyceraldehyde 3phosphate ga3p which is used by the plant to produce sugar or starch or to be cycled back to make ru bp which again allows for carbon fixation3pg can form ga3pphotosynthesis so where does photosynthesis fit into all of this photosynthesis takes place inside organelles called chloroplasts and is the process whereby plants convert sunlight into energy and oxygen the inside of the chloroplast is called the stroma photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplast and has two phases a light reaction and a lightindependent reaction lir during the light reaction water is used in conjunction with a very excited electron to make atp the molecule animals and plants use for energy with the waste product oxygen yes oxygen is a waste product to plants like co2 is our waste product when breathing another molecule nadp is converted to nadph because it ultimately accepts excited electrons to unlock this lesson you must be a studycom member create your account register for a free trial are you a student or a teacher i am a student i am a teacher
