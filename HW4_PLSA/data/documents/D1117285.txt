in this episode church architecture conversion part 2lauren winner extended interview madeleine l’engle madeleine l’engle extended interview madeleine l’engle february 10 2012 — originally published november 17 2000bob abernethy anchor now a profile of a bestselling writer of fantasy and adventure long before j k rowling created harry potter she is madeleine l’engle whose science fiction beginning with a wrinkle in time like the harry potter books has been both widely read by young people and strongly criticized by some religious conservatives i spoke with madeleine l’engle a year ago about christianity censorship science suffering and love madeleine l’engle broke her hip last year and that has slowed her down but on this evening as an episcopal lay woman she was saying vespers with the nine episcopal nuns at new york’s community of the holy spirit l’engle prays and reads the bible and the book of common prayer every morning and evening for many years she did her writing at the cathedral of saint john the divine where she is still librarian and writerinresidence so does all that christian practice make her a christian writer madeleine l’engle no i am a writer that’s it no adjectives the first thing is writing christian is secondary abernethy at occasional workshops for other writers madeleine passes on her unsentimental uncomplaining approach to life and her craft l’engle basically one word write so who would like to be the first to read a young poet went to colette and complained that he was unhappy and she said “who asked you to be happy write” and i think that is very good advice abernethy madeleine is working now on a book about aging and an article about hate she has written more than 50 books of which the most famous is a wrinkle in time published in 1961 after more than 30 rejections the heroine is a teenager named meg who expresses l’engle’s own deepest belief l’engle meg finally realizes that love is stronger than hate hate may seem to win for a while but love is stronger than hate abernethy a wrinkle in time is a sciencefiction fantasy that has sold more than six million copies and is now in its 66th printing readers still send madeleine copies of that book and others to autograph and she says she never tires of signing them l’engle never because anybody who has received as many rejection slips as i have is not going to complain about autographs abernethy many christians have found in madeleine l’engle’s books a profound religious message others have seen her witches and dark forces as essentially unchristian and their complaints to schools and libraries have made l’engle one of the ten most banned writers in the country ms l’engle we have always liked banning and hitler and his cohorts started banning books and then to killing people you have got to be very careful of banning what you ban is not going to hurt anybody usually but the act of banning is abernethy l’engle’s view of the universe has been shaped by both christianity and science often at night she reads both the bible and books about particle physics and she sees no conflict between them l’engle religion and science one and the same i don’t have any trouble with it a lot of people do they have to put one here and one there and i think they’re much more like that each one informing the other abernethy but isn’t the skeptical scientific attitude a challenge to faith l’engle religion is less accepting than science science knows things move and change and religion doesn’t want that so i am more comfortable with science at the same time i am not throwing god out the window abernethy but you’re making a distinction between religion and god l’engle temple the archbishop in the 19th century said “god is not chiefly interested in religion” i like that abernethy l’engle has experienced a lot of loss in her life the death of her husband hugh franklin an actor wellknown for his role as a doctor in the tv series all my children she wrote about their marriage and his death in her book twopart invention she wrote about her mother’s death in the summer of the great grandmother many of madeleine’s close friends have died and last christmastime so did her son bion ms l’engle reading from her journal it’s late at night on christmas eve we went to the cathedral for the midnight mass bion died a week ago today i still don’t believe it bion’s death has ripped the fabric of the universe abernethy madeleine has kept journals almost all her life and she says writing in them about grief makes it easier to bear l’engle i am very grateful that i have a journal and that i can write because that helps me to objectify things that might just mess me around emotionally otherwise i can no longer look at this and weep and feel sorry for myself i see it more clearly and it sends me back to work abernethy eventually madeleine says she will write about her son madeleine sees suffering as a normal part of life and she also says she feels closest to god when she suffers l’engle in times when we are not particularly suffering we do not have enough time for god we are too busy with other things and then the intense suffering comes and we can’t be busy with other things and then god comes into the equation “help” and we should never be afraid of crying out “help”abernethy madeleine also sees suffering as necessary for a full life l’engle where there is no suffering nothing happens one time my godmother went to visit my mother who was her best friend and something awful had happened i don’t know what and she burst into tears instead of offering comfort and said “i envy you i envy you you had a terrible life but you have lived”abernethy l’engle insists that in the end life and the universe are good she remembers singing a sad ballad to one of her two granddaughters when she was a child l’engle and she said “gran you know that is a bad one” and i said “what” “gran you know that’s a bad one” and i said “why charlotte because everybody dies” and she said “no gran nobody loved anybody” and then it was the next night putting them to bed that lena just looked at me cosmically and said “gran is it all right” she didn’t mean any thing … she meant the whole thing “is it all right” and i swallowed my heart and my everything and said “yes lena it’s all right”abernethy madeleine grew up an only and she says a lonely child so she loves family gatherings such as this one with four generations she says she expects to keep enjoying good company good food good talk and work for another twenty years l’engle i was writing in my journal yesterday and ended a paragraph with “i think it smells like hope” and we have to hang on to that related reading suncatcher a study of madeleine lengle and her
