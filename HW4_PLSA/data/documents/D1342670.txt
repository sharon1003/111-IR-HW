families in search of opportunity there’s no shortage of economic activity in the state for one california’s gdp of 25 trillion in 2015 exceeded those of all but five countries that’s due in part to

first state to offer that incentive to american families and remains one of only a handful of states to implement such a policy add to that list of priorities an abundance of fun and entertainment

experts in fields such as family studies and public health to share their insight regarding the process of evaluating prospective california cities on a family’s shortlist click on the experts’ profiles below to read their bios and their thoughts on the following key questions what are some tips for young families looking for quality public schools and affordable housing in california how can local officials in california make their cities more attractive to young families looking just within california to what degree is child development and a family’s quality of life influenced by the city they live in back to all experts susan j paik associate professor of education at claremont graduate university what are some tips for young families looking for quality public schools and affordable housing in california california has the largest u s population consisting of almost 40 million people in nearly 500 cities so it’s hard to answer this question housing and schooling options can vary significantly across californian cities and counties the answer actually hinges on what area of california is of most interest and value to the parents further because the u s educational system is decentralized californian decisionmaking power regarding educational resources eg curriculum finances etc occurs at local levels this means that one school district can be teaching something entirely different from another in a neighboring municipality so both content and quality can differ greatly from city to city and school to school from a practical standpoint everybody also knows some of the worst traffic in the u s can be found on a ca freeway why it’s because affordable housing is usually not found near one’s workplace and people have to commute from a chosen bedroom community but not all cities are equal some of these communities do have access to better schools and housing options than others with that said any good consumer will do their research first here are some practical tips to consider do some online research based on your region of interest or within your commuting radius there are a number of organizations that provide helpful online information on schools for example here are a few educational websites national center for education statistics school digger and great schools you can find school information on test scores grades rankings ratings submitted by parents others and students themselves programs studentteacher ratios demographics and other resources consider alternative options to public schools there are many types of schools that offer competitive curricula and program offerings alternative public schools eg charter schools magnet schools private schools eg religious schools prep schools and other options charter schools in particular are independent public schools which have gained more popularity offering competitive academics and enrichment charter schools appear to have more performance accountability and more freedom than traditional public schools magnet schools are also public schools but with specialized programs and curriculum parents may be less restricted to certain neighborhoods or districts when choosing these options other alternative options may cost more but are generally less restricted than public schools visit the schools and learn about the school community students teachers school leadership curricula and other specialized or extracurricular programs academic offerings are key however school communities matter good schools and teachers can also enhance students’ educational experiences through language programs vocational options music arts sports and other enrichment activities and finally do your research on housing options after you’ve located quality schools a good real estate agent and online research these days can help provide more options than what was available ten years ago however in some respects we know that quality schools and affordable housing don’t always pair up nicely while most searches will involve some compromise in one or the other careful and persistent searches can reveal opportunities for young families in the end young families should look for schools and communities where children can thrive and be successful how can local officials in california make their cities more attractive to young families in general california is considered highly attractive due its weather landscape coastal location tourist attractions diversity and demographics these are just a few reasons why travelers or new residents come to visit or live in california however for any city not just in california local officials should focus first and foremost on their educational initiatives quality schooling and program offerings in school and out of school are key to attracting young families and growing communities stakeholders should work together to build effective pre k and other early childhood education programseffective k12 schoolsafterschool and weekend programs for children and youthsafe and healthy neighborhoods communities and learning environments libraries museums parks etc for children to play learn and growfamilyfriendly and communitybuilding events and programs for all ages looking just within california to what degree is child development and a family’s quality of life influenced by the city they live in different environments will have varying outcomes on human development in short context matters urban suburban rural or anything in between has different effects across individuals in california or elsewhere wellknown researcher urie bronfenbrenner conducted research in the 1970’s his research is still wellcited today because of his broad encompassing approach to explaining human behavior and development his work involved the importance of external environments in this case how the location of your residence neighborhood and community impacts human development his ecological model 1979 showed the path of development from micro to macro levels including factors such as the home school peers communities societies and cultures depending on the regional area or town in california research shows that these factors will have direct and indirect impact on children’s resources and overall development as well as the quality of life for all families kelly campbell associate professor of psychology and associate director of the institute for child development and family relations at california state university san bernardino jennifer

school of education alicia d bonaparte associate professor of sociology at pitzer college susan j paik associate professor of education at claremont graduate university back to all experts kelly campbell associate professor of psychology and associate director of the institute for child development and family relations at california state university san bernardino what are some tips for young families looking for quality public schools and affordable housing in california look into the gifted programs in public schools read up on school reviews look up reviews to find a good realtor there are some who specialize in rental properties as well get a realtor who knows about the low income program qualifications how can local officials in california make their cities more attractive to young families work on improving the public transit have parks don’t let the city go bankrupt as it happened in san bernardino because important resources that contribute to safety are affected eg the number of police officers went way down work on getting trader joe’s and fresh produce stores in all communities work on having affordable and quality child care good ratio of care providers to children and have workers who are trained in child development and know how to use developmentally appropriate practices have bike lanes provide train service to the beach communities require workplaces to have family friendly policies like family sick leave good parental leave policies and offer high quality childcare on site ensure that schools are not overcrowded have enough schools have after school programs stop building factories and distribution centers in communities have policies about the number of chain restaurants that are allowed to be opened in each community because nonchains are way better and healthier pay teachers more and invest in education looking just within california to what degree is child development and a family’s quality of life influenced by the
