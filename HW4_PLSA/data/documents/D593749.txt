edit article how to get a good grade on a math test many students find that math is the hardest subject in school probably because you learn a lot of things in a small amount of time math is also difficult due to the fact that numbers are another language and your horizons on this language are constantly expanding it is possible to overcome this hurdle and enjoy math though steps1 go to class while you can get away with skipping class in some subjects math is like a ladder if a rung is missing or if you dont get a good grip on it youll struggle to reach the next rung if too many rungs are missing it will be impossible to climb higher in addition teachers often emphasize the most important topics in class so youll know exactly what to study by test time2 sit in the front row and participate in class by sitting in the front row youll be able to minimize distractions and heighten your performance asking questions or providing answers helps the student to stay engaged in the learning process this improving attentiveness and retention of materials learned3 do your homework homework may seem like torture but its truly designed to help you learn as with any other subject the key to learning math is repetition you have to do enough problems with the quadratic formula or any formula really if you do youll eventually be able to recite these formulas in your sleep plus as you do your homework youll be able to identify concepts you dont understand it also doesnt hurt that test questions are often based on the homework assignments4 ask questions you may have done your

cramming however youre better prepared than that anyway go over your notes take practice tests and make sure you have important formulas memorized of course you could watch the simpsons instead of studying but dont be surprised if your grades turn out more like barts than like lisas bart failed his test because he watched tv instead of studying while lisa passed and moved on to the next grade
