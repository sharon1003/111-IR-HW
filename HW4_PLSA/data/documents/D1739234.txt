counter big pharmacies includes those counters at super markets will not sell those over the counter some small pharmacies may give it on the sly it will depend on your appearance if they suspect if you are from law enforcement or a decoy they wont  if they see no danger  for them not to the buyer they will just give it advice  bring over sufficient medicine with you along with a prescription in an emergency talk to your hotel ppl or driver  tuk tuk and try to buy through them coz any pharmacy big or small will sell it to known ppl btw may be benzos will not be available in trade name it would be diazepam or host of other brands  be prepared to substitute take care reply report inappropriate content dennis c1 post1 review save reply6 re over the counter benzos oct 21 2017 334 amreally
