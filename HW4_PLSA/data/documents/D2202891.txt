number 0820policy aetna considers implantable carotid sinus stimulators eg the barostim neo ™ system and the rheos baroreflex hypertension therapy system experimental and investigational for the treatment of hypertension and for all other indications eg heart failure because its effectiveness has not been established aetna considers magnetic stimulation of carotid sinus experimental and investigational for the treatment of hypertension because its effectiveness has not been established background hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the united states despite the availability of potent antihypertensive medications many patients remain hypertensive thus nonpharmacological therapies have been attracting more interest electrical stimulation es of the carotid sinus has been shown to lowers blood pressure bp by activating the baroreflex and thereby reducing sympathetic tone the arterial baroreflex regulates mean arterial pressure by responding automatically to changes in cardiac output and vessel tone via baroreceptors which monitor arterial pressure by gauging the degree of stretch in vessel walls baroreceptors are located in the walls of the aorta and carotid arteries with a concentration of receptors located within the carotid sinus activation of baroreceptors produces immediate responses in cardiovascular sympathetic and cardiac parasympathetic nerves to adjust heart rate hr stroke volume vasoconstriction as well as fluid excretion these actions raise or lower bp as needed the rheos baroreflex hypertension therapy system cvrx inc minneapolis mn is an implantable device for the treatment of patients with drugresistant hypertension ie the hypertensive state characterized by the inability of multiple antihypertensive drug interventions to lower bp to goal levels who have a systolic bp sbp of greater than or equal to 160 mm hg it is reported to reduce bp by activating the baroreflex through es of baroreceptors in the carotid sinus the rheos baroreflex hypertension therapy system has 3 major components an implantable pulse generator ipgcarotid sinus leads cslsa programmer system the pulse generator is implanted subcutaneously near the collarbone the csls are placed on the carotid arteries and run subcutaneously to the pulse generator  note the procedure does not involve carotid dissection the operation usually takes about 2 to 3 hours after implantation a continuous mild electrical pulsation stimulates baroreceptors to produce a reflexive reduction in bp the ipg provides control and delivery of activation energy through the csls the leads conduct activation energy from the ipg to target receptors in the left and right carotid arteries the programmer system provides the ability to communicate noninvasively with the ipg after implantation to modulate the frequency and intensity of es in a phase ii clinical trial illig et al 2006 evaluated the response of patients with multidrugresistant hypertension to es of the carotid sinus via an implantable device the system consists of an ipg with bilateral perivascular csls implantation was performed bilaterally with patients under narcotic anesthesia doseresponse testing at 0 to 6 v was assessed before discharge and at monthly intervals thereafter the device was activated after 1 months recovery time this was a food and drug administrationmonitored phase ii trial performed at 5 centers in the united states a total of 10 patients with resistant hypertension taking a median of 6 antihypertensive medications underwent implantation all 10 were successful with no significant morbidity the mean procedure time was 198 minutes there were no adverse events attributable to the device predischarge doseresponse testing revealed consistent r  088 reductions in sbp of 41 mm hg mean fall is from 180 to 139 mm hg with a peak response at 48 v p  0001 and without significant bradycardia or bothersome symptoms the authors concluded that a surgically implantable device for es of the carotid baroreflex system can be placed safely and produces a significant acute decrease in bp without significant side effects tordoir et al 2007 examined perioperative outcomes and bp responses to an implantable carotid sinus baroreflex activating system being investigated for the treatment of drugresistant hypertension these investigators reported on the first 17 patients enrolled in a multicenter study bilateral perivascular csls and a ipg are permanently implanted optimal placement of the csl is determined by intraoperative bp responses to test activations acute bp responses were tested postoperatively and during the first 4 months of followup prior to implant bp was 1896  275 sbp1107  153 diastolic bp dbp mm hg despite stable therapy 52  18 antihypertensive drugs the mean procedure time was 202  43 minutes no perioperative strokes or deaths occurred system tests performed 1 or up to 3 days postoperatively resulted in significant all p  or  00001 mean maximum reduction with standard deviations and 95  confidence limits for sbp dbp and hr of 28  22 17 39 mm hg 16  11 10 22 mm hg and 8  4 6 11 beatsmin respectively repeated testing during 3 months of therapeutic electrical activation demonstrated a durable response the authors concluded that these preliminary data suggest an acceptable safety of the procedure with a low rate of adverse events and support further clinical development of baroreflex activation as a new concept to treat resistant hypertension heusser et al 2010 tested the hypothesis that es of carotid baroreceptors acutely reduces sympathetic vasomotor tone and bp in patients with drugresistant arterial hypertension furthermore these researchers tested whether es impairs the physiological baroreflex regulation they studied 7 men and 5 women aged 43 to 69 years with drugresistant arterial hypertension a bilateral electric baroreflex stimulator at the level of the carotid sinus rheos was implanted greater than or equal to 1 month before the study intraarterial bp hr muscle sympathetic nerve activity microneurography cardiac baroreflex sensitivity crossspectral analysis and sequence method sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity threshold technique plasma renin and norepinephrine concentrations were measured measurements were performed under resting conditions with and without electric baroreflex stimulation for greater than or equal to 6 minutes during the same experiment intraarterial bp was 193  994  5 mm hg on medications acute electric baroreflex stimulation decreased sbp by 32  10 mm hg range of 7 to 108 mm hg p  001 the depressor response was correlated with a muscle sympathetic nerve activity reduction r 2  042 p  005 in responders muscle sympathetic nerve activity decreased sharply when es started then muscle sympathetic nerve activity increased but remained below the baseline level throughout the stimulation period heart rate decreased 45  15 beatsmin with es p  005 plasma renin concentration decreased 20  8  p  005 electrical stimulation of carotid sinus baroreflex afferents acutely decreased arterial bp in hypertensive patients without negative effects on physiological baroreflex regulation the depressor response was mediated through sympathetic inhibition sanchez et al 2010 evaluated carotid artery structural integrity after implantation of the csls a total of 29 csls were implanted on the common carotid arteries of 8 sheep the studies were terminated at 3 and 6 months postimplantation to assess anatomical and histological changes additionally 10 patients with resistant hypertension were enrolled in the rheos multicenter feasibility trial duplex ultrasound dus was performed before device implantation and at 1 and 4 months postimplantation in this patient cohort an independent core laboratory assessed all duss ovine carotid angiography revealed no significant stenoses while anatomical and histological evaluations demonstrated electrode encapsulation in a thin layer of connective tissue with no evidence of stenosis erosion or inflammation duplex ultrasound evaluation revealed no significant increase in peak systolic velocities of the common and internal carotid arteries 1 and 4 months after initial implantation indicating a lack of injury remodeling or stenosis the authors concluded that the current data suggested that the csls used with the rheos system are not associated with the development of carotid stenosis or injury these shortterm data support the concept of csl placement and merit longterm investigation in a larger multicenter prospective trial in a prospective nonrandomized feasibility study scheffers et al 2010 examined the safety and efficacy of rheos therapy in drugresistant hypertension patients a total of 45 subjects with sbp greater than or equal to 160 mm hg or dbp greater than or equal to 90 mm hg despite at least 3 antihypertensive drugs were enrolled in this study subjects were followedup for as long as 2 years an external programmer was used to optimize and individualize efficacy baseline mean bp was 179105 mm hg and hr was 80 beatsmin with a median of 5 antihypertensive drugs after 3 months of device therapy mean bp was reduced by 2112 mm hg this result was sustained in 17 subjects who completed 2 years of followup with a mean reduction of 3322 mm hg the device exhibited a favorable safety profile the authors concluded that the rheos device sustainably reduces bp in drugresistant hypertensive subjects with multiple comorbidities receiving numerous medications they stated that this novel approach holds promise for patients with drugresistant hypertension and is currently under evaluation in a prospective placebocontrolled clinical trial doumas et al 2009 stated that the role of the carotid baroreflex in bp regulation has been known for a long time but its effects were thought to be shortlived recent data indicate that stimulation of carotid baroreceptors may lower bp not only for short periods of time but also in the long run recent advances in technology permitted the development of a new device rheos that addresses problems with older devices several questions remain to be addressed before rheos can be used widely and several potential clinical applications remain to be clarified the authors stated that the carotid baroreceptor reflex is probably not completely in control of bp baroreflexes are one of many control systems acting in concert joshi and associates 2009 stated that es of the carotid sinus baroreceptor through a surgically implanted device is currently under clinical investigation and is showing some encouraging early results furthermore lovett et al 2009 noted that chronic results from feasibility studies indicated that rheos therapy has an acceptable safety profile and may lead to longterm control of bp in drugresistant hypertensive patients other effects include significant reductions in left ventricular mass and left atrial size the spectrum of therapeutic impact suggests that rheos therapy may improve longterm outcomes in drugresistant hypertension and possibly benefit related populations they noted that larger randomized controlled trials are ongoing to verify chronic benefits grassi et al 2010 stated that drugresistant hypertension represents a condition frequently detected in clinical practice its main features are represented by its heterogeneous etiology as well as its very high cardiovascular risk this latter peculiarity has implemented the research for new approaches to the treatment of the disease these researchers discussed 2 of these approachescarotid baroreceptor es and the renal denervation procedure they stated that clinical studies and largescale clinical trials are presently ongoing with the aim of defining the longterm safety and effectiveness of the 2 interventions taylor and bisognano 2010 stated that chronic baroreceptor es of the carotid sinus has been shown to reduce bp by inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system especially the renal sympathetic tone this finding has led to the development of implantable carotid sinus stimulators which have now been studied in both animals and humans as a means for treating chronic hypertension the enthusiasm for this modality has led to ongoing studies which will provide more information on its safety and effectiveness in patients with drugresistant hypertension the early study results using baroreflex es therapy are promising and suggest that it may play a significant role in controlling bp in the future kougias et al 2010 stated that a model of es of the carotid sinus has been developed and successfully tested in animals following these encouraging results human trials to evaluate the clinical application of electrical carotid sinus manipulation in the treatment of systemic hypertension have commenced and results so far indicated that this represents an exciting potential tool in the clinicians armament against chronic arterial hypertension lohmeier and iliescu 2011 summarized the preclinical studies that have provided insight into the mechanisms that account for the chronic bplowering effects of carotid baroreflex activation some of the mechanisms identified were predictable and confirmed by experimentation others have been surprising and controversial and resolution will require further investigation they stated that although feasibility studies have been promising firm conclusions regarding the value of this devicebased therapy for the treatment of drugresistant hypertension awaits the results of current multicenter trials ng and colleagues 2011 noted that the rheos baroreflex hypertension therapy system is a new implantable device that can treat patients with hypertension resistant to multidrug therapy by activating the carotid baroreflex through es of the carotid sinus wall recent studies in both normotensive and hypertensive canine models have reported sustained and clinically relevant reductions in arterial pressure and sympathetic activity with prolonged baroreflex activation clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this therapy in patients with drugresistant hypertension are now ongoing in both europe and the united states bisognano et al 2011 examined the effect of baroreflex activation therapy bat on sbp in patients with resistant hypertension this was a doubleblind randomized trial of 265 subjects with resistant hypertension implanted and subsequently randomized 21 1 month after implantation subjects received either bat group a for the first 6 months or delayed bat initiation following the 6month visit group b the 5 coprimary endpoints wereacute sbp responder rate at 6 months sustained responder rate at 12 months procedure safety bat safety anddevice safety the trial showed significant benefit for the endpoints of sustained efficacy bat safety and device safety however it did not meet the endpoints for acute responders or procedural safety a protocolspecified ancillary analysis showed 42  group a versus 24  group b achieving sbp less than or equal to 140 mm hg at 6 months p  0005 with both groups achieving over 50  at 12 months at which point group b had received 6 months of bat the authors concluded that a clinically meaningful measure those achieving a sbp of less than or equal to 140 mm hg yielded a significant difference between the groups the weight of the overall evidence suggested that over the longterm bat can safely reduce sbp in patients with resistant hypertension they stated that future clinical trials will address the limitations of this study and further define the therapeutic benefit of bat in a singlearm openlabel study hoppe and associates 2012 evaluated the effectiveness of the barostim neo ™ system a 2ndgeneration system for delivering bat subjects were patients with resistant hypertension sbp greater than or equal to 140 mm hg despite treatment with 3 or more medications including 1 ore more diuretic stable medical therapy was required for 4 or more weeks before establishing pretreatment baseline by averaging 2 sbp readings taken 24 or more hours apart a total of 30 patients enrolled from 7 medical centers in europe and canada from a baseline of 1717  202995  139 mm hg arterial bp decreased by 260  44124  25 mm hg at 6 months in a subset n  6 of patients with prior renal nerve ablation arterial bp decreased by 223  98 mm hg background medical therapy for hypertension was unchanged during followup three minor procedurerelated complications occurred within 30 days of implant all complications resolved without sequelae the authors concluded that bat delivered with the 2ndgeneration system significantly lowers bp in resistant hypertension with stable intensive background medical therapy consistent with studies of the 1stgeneration system for electrical activation of the baroreflex and provides a safety profile comparable to a pacemaker the findings of this small openlabel study need to be validated by welldesigned studies jordan et al 2012 noted that recently a novel implantable device was developed that produces an electrical field stimulation of the carotid sinus wall carefully conducted experiments in dogs provided important insight in mechanisms mediating the depressor response to electrical carotid sinus stimulation moreover these studies showed that the treatment success may depend on the underlying pathophysiology of the hypertension the authors stated that clinical studies suggested that electrical carotid sinus stimulation attenuates sympathetic activation of vasculature heart and kidney while augmenting cardiac vagal regulation thus lowering bp however not all patients respond to treatment they concluded that additional clinical trials are needed to ascertain the effectiveness of electrical carotid sinus stimulation in treatment resistant arterial hypertension jordan et al 2013 stated that hypertension is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular and renaldisease endpoints medications help many patients but not all recently 2 devicerelated treatments have been introduced catheterbased renal denervation and electrical carotid sinus stimulation remuneration for these treatments is guaranteed in many countries even though basic information is missing these investigators drew attention to deficiencies in the database for catheterbased renal denervation few largeanimal data are available to investigate the effect of the intervention on the histology of the arterial wall no functional data are available regarding reinnervation for carotid sinus stimulation the situation is similar the authors concluded that acute activation of either treatment seems to reduce sympathetic tone dramatically however whether or not the effects are sustained over time is unknown they stated that no “endpoint” data are available for either treatment and devices should be subjected to evidencebased standards before widespread introduction chobanyanjurgens et al 2015 stated that treatmentresistant arterial hypertension is associated with excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality electrical carotid sinus stimulators engaging baroreflex afferent activity have been developed for such patients indeed baroreflex mechanisms contribute to longterm bp control by governing efferent sympathetic and parasympathetic activity the firstgeneration carotid sinus stimulator applying bilateral bipolar stimulation reduced bp in a controlled clinical trial but nevertheless failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoint the secondgeneration device utilizes smaller unilateral unipolar electrodes thus decreasing invasiveness of the implantation while saving battery an uncontrolled clinical study suggested improvement in bp with the secondgeneration device the authors hoped that these findings as well as preliminary observations suggesting cardiovascular and renal organ protection with electrical carotid sinus stimulation will be confirmed in properly controlled clinical trials moreover these researchers noted that it is important to find ways to better identify patients who are most likely to benefit from electrical carotid sinus stimulation victor 2015 noted that arterial baroreceptors are mechanosensitive sensory nerve endings in the walls of the carotid sinuses and aortic arch that buffer the increases and decreases in arterial bp electrical field stimulation of the carotid sinus known as carotid baroreflex activation therapy holds promise as a novel devicebased intervention to supplement but not replace drug therapy for patients with resistant hypertension acute electrical field stimulation of even 1 carotid sinus can cause a sufficiently large reflex decrease in bp to overcome offsetting reflexes from the contralateral carotid baroreceptors and aortic baroreceptors that are not paced however the initial phase iii rheos pivotal trial on continuous carotid baroreceptor pacing for resistant hypertension with the firstgeneration baroreceptor pacemaker yielded equivocal data on efficacy and adverse effects due to facial nerve injury during surgical implantation a miniaturized secondgeneration pacing electrode has seemingly overcome the safety issue and early results with the new device suggested efficacy of unilateral carotid sinus stimulation in heart failure hf the authors stated that a phase iii clinical trial of this new device for resistant hypertension has been registered heusser and colleagues 2016 stated that bilateral bipolar electric carotid sinus stimulation acutely reduced muscle sympathetic nerve activity msna and bp in patients with resistant arterial hypertension but is no longer available the 2ndgeneration device uses a smaller unilateral unipolar disk electrode to reduce invasiveness while saving battery life these researchers hypothesized that the 2ndgeneration device acutely lowers bp and msna in treatmentresistant hypertensive patients in this study a total of 18 treatmentresistant hypertensive patients 9 women9 men 53 ± 11 years 33 ± 5 kgm 2 on stable medications have been included in the study these investigators monitored finger and brachial bp hr and msna without stimulation bp was 165 ± 3191 ± 18 mm hg hr was 75 ± 17 bpm and msna was 48 ± 14 burstsmin acute stimulation with intensities producing side effects that were tolerable in the shortterm elicited interindividually variable changes in systolic bp 169 ± 150 mm hg range of 00 to 408 mm hg p  0002 hr 36 ± 36 bpm p  0004 and msna 20 ± 58 burstsmin p  0375 stimulation intensities had to be lowered in 12 patients to avoid side effects at the expense of efficacy systolic bp 63 ± 70 mm hg range of 28 to 145 mm hg p  0028 and hr 15 ± 23 bpm p  0078 comparison against responses with side effects reductions in diastolic bp and msna total activity were correlated r 2  0329 p  0025 the authors concluded that in this patient cohort unilateral unipolar electric baroreflex stimulation acutely lowered bp however side effects may limit efficacy they stated that this approach should be tested in a controlled comparative study wallbach and associates 2016 noted that bat has been demonstrated to decrease office bp in the randomized doubleblind rheos trial there are limited data on 24hour bp changes measured by ambulatory bp measurements abpms using the 1st generation rheos bat system suggesting a significant reduction but there are no information about the effect of the currently used unilateral bat neo device on abpm in an observational study abpm was performed before bat implantation and 6 months after initiation of bat in patients treated with the bat neo device for uncontrolled resistant hypertension a total of 51 patients were included in this study 7 droppedout from analysis because of missing or insufficient followup after 6 months 24hour ambulatory systolic from 148 ± 17 mm hg to 140 ± 23 mm hg p  001 diastolic from 82 ± 13 mm hg to 77 ± 15 mm hg p  001 day and nighttime systolic and diastolic bp all p ≤ 001 significantly decreased while the number of prescribed antihypertensive classes could be reduced from 65 ± 15 to 60 ± 18 p  003 hr and pulse pressure remained unchanged baroreflex activation therapy was equally effective in reducing ambulatory bp in all subgroups of patients the authors concluded that this was the first study demonstrating a significant bp reduction in abpm in patients undergoing chronically stimulation of the carotid sinus using the bat neo device about that batreduced office bp and improved relevant aspects of abpm bat might be considered as a new therapeutic option to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with resistant hypertension moreover they stated that randomized controlled trials rcts are needed to evaluate bat effects on abpm in patients with resistant hypertension accurately ng and colleagues 2016 discussed 7 novel devices for the treatment of resistant hypertension rhtnrenal nerve denervation bat carotid sinus stimulation carotid body ablation central iliac arteriovenous anastomosisdeep brain stimulation median nerve stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation the authors noted that the barostim hypertension pivotal trial clinicaltrialsgov nct01679132 is currently in progress and aims to enroll 310 patients with rhtn randomized to receiving optimal medical management alone or in combination with the bat which may also have a role outside of bp management and is currently being evaluated as an adjunctive therapy in hf jordan 2017 stated that devicebased antihypertensive treatments have primarily been developed and clinically tested for patients with hypertension refractory to pharmacological treatment most but not all devicebased treatments target the sympathetic nervous system and provided important new insight in the mechanisms of human hypertension this investigator provided an overview on the scientific rational and clinical data on recent devicebased antihypertensive treatment approaches devicebased treatments targeting the sympathetic nervous system include catheterbased renal nerve ablation electrical carotid sinus stimulation modulation of baroreflex transduction through a dedicated carotid stent carotid body denervation and deep brain stimulation creation of a defined arteriovenous stent with a coupler device and removal of stimulatory antibodies against alpha adrenoreceptors have also been tested the author concluded that the clinical evidence differed from therapy to therapy with the largest dataset for renal nerve ablation followed by electrical carotid sinus stimulation however none has been proven effective in shamcontrolled clinical trials and none has been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality the author stated that before effectiveness is proven these treatments should not be part of routine medical care and only be applied in the setting of clinical studies magnetic stimulation of carotid sinus zhang and colleagues 2017 evaluated the effectiveness of magnetic stimulation of carotid sinus mscs a noninvasive strategy for lowering bp in rabbits mscs with graded intensities and frequencies were systematically attempted in normotensive rabbits bp was recorded dynamically sinoaortic denervation and plasma hormone level analyses were performed when the right carotid sinus was stimulated at 1hz frequency a doseeffect relationship was observed between stimulation intensity 100 to 250  motor threshold and mean arterial pressure map decrement 36 ± 10 to 104 ± 23 mm hg when stimulation intensity was fixed at 200  motor threshold the median reduction of map in 1hz group 108 86 to 149 mm hg was significantly higher than that in other frequency groups all p  005 heart rates declined transiently after the initiation of mscs compared with baseline plasma epinephrine level increased during mscs from 339 ± 55 pgml to 881 ± 96 p  0002 after ipsilateral sinoaortic denervation map decrement was remarkably blunted compared with that in sham animals 70 ± 08 mm hg versus 130 ± 11 mm hg p  0001 the authors concluded that the findings of the current study demonstrated that mscs treatment can lower the arterial pressure in normotensive rabbits they stated that is preliminarily finding warrants further studies to establish the effectiveness of mscs in treating refractory hypertension other indications georgakopoulos et al 2011 stated that heart failure with preserved ejection fraction hfp ef is a substantial public health issue equal in magnitude to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction clinical outcomes of hfp ef patients are generally poor and no therapy has been shown to be effective in randomized clinical trials baroreflex activation therapy bat produced by stimulating the carotid sinuses using the rheos device is being studied for the treatment of hypertension the primary comorbidity of hfp ef other potential benefits include regression of left ventricular hypertrophy normalization of the sympathovagal balance inhibition of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system arterio and venodilation and preservation of renal function the authors concluded that bat may be a promising therapy for hfp ef and introduced the hope4hf trial a randomized outcomes trial designed to evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness of bat in the hfp ef population the institute for clinical systems improvements clinical practice guideline on heart failure in adults icsi 2011 did not mention the use of bat an european heart rhythm association’s report on “new devices in heart failure” kuck et al 2014 stated that several new devices for the treatment of hf patients have been introduced and are increasingly used in clinical practice or are under clinical evaluation in either observational andor randomized clinical trials these devices include cardiac contractility modulation spinal cord stimulation carotid sinus nerve stimulation cervical vagal stimulation intracardiac atrioventricular nodal vagal stimulation and implantable hemodynamic monitoring
