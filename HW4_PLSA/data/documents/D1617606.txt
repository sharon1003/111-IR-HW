fields in chapter 6 we studied propagating electromagnetic fields of which light is a special case electric and magnetic fields are inextricably linked to each other and as mentioned earlier a changing electric field automatically creates a changing magnetic field and visa versa recall that an electric charge undergoing acceleration radiates off electromagnetic fields if the electric charge is stationary in some frame then it only generates an electric field an electric charge moving at some constant velocity generates both electric and magnetic fields changing time varying and fields generate a and respectively and lastly if the electric or magnetic field is static constant in time it exists by itself in this chapter we focus on the static and stationary cases and study in some detail the individual properties of the and fields the electric field by itself is of enormous importance our contemporary civilization cannot even be imagined without the presence of electric power not only does electric power provide energy to run an almost endless list of modern devices electricity powers modern industries and cities as well electric fields permeate natural phenomena a study of atoms and molecules shows that it is primarily due to electrical forces that atoms and molecules are bound together into stable objects hence in a real sense all the varied materials around us exist due to the workings of the electric field more close to home the workings of the biological nervous system is based on the movement of charges and the brain can sense feel think and so on largely due to electrical currents stationary magnetic fields are interesting in their own right and we will briefly study a few examples of these an understanding of electric and magnetic fields is the key to unlocking the inner workings of nature of the four fundamental forces in nature listed in figure 21 except for gravity all the other forces of nature are direct generalizations of the electromagnetic fields electric and magnetic fields are a prototype of the yangmills fields that form the substratum of natures laws we now examine the individual properties of electric and magnetic fields always keeping in mind that these two fields are two facets of a single electromagnetic field electric charges and force the concept of electric charge is the key to understanding the phenomena of electricity and magnetism electric charge denoted by is a property of matter similar to mass recall from section 311 that the si unit of electric charge is coulomb that is  unlike mass charge is more difficult to directly experience since most of matter is neutral lightning is a case of electric charge moving from the clouds to the earth with light being emitted due to its motion an effect similar to lightning is the mild shock one sometimes gets in a dry climate when touching a metal object  the shock being due to the movement of electric charge from the human body to the metallic object recall in our discussion on the gravitational and electrostatic potential energy in section 311 we had listed the similarities and differences in physical effects of mass and charge there are two properties of charge which make it very different from mass firstly charge comes in two varieties namely negative and positive and secondly as derived in eq  3100  the strength of electrical attraction is more than times greater than the strength of gravitational attraction figure 71 force between like and opposite charges we state a few remarkable and farreaching experimental facts about electric charge like charges repel each other and opposite charges attract as shown in figure 71  electric charge is absolutely conserved electric charge cannot be created or destroyed the total electric charge in the universe is a constant however since electric charge comes with opposite signs one can create equal number of positive and negative charges without violating charge conservation and this is precisely what happens in the phenomenon of pair creation where an electron with charge and an antielectron with charge are simultaneously created electric charge is discrete comes in units of the irreducible charge of the electron which is denoted by all observed charges in nature is of the form 71this quantization of electric charge is an experimental truth and was known before the advent of quantum mechanics if the charges are separated by a distance the coulomb force between them is given by 72 73and from eq  397 we have 74note that like all other forces the coulomb force is a vector and points along the line joining two charges which is the radial vector the coulomb force has to be radial due to symmetry considerations since the only vector in the problem is the radial vector  figure 72 electric field of a positive point charge electric fields recall from our earlier discussion that the force exerted on a charged particle say is due to the electric field created by the charge that is from eq  636  we have 75the presence of an electrical force is the manifestation of an electric field since the force due to a point charge is radial we conclude that the electric field is radial and is given by 76as shown in figure 72 we represent the electric field by lines emanating from positive charge with the arrows on the lines indicating that the direction of the electric field points radially outwards conversely the electric field due to a negative charge points inwards as shown in figure 73 indicating the inward force on a positive test charge brought close to  the analogy for electric charge is the idea of a source and sink for fluid flow the tap serves as a source for water and when we open a tap water flows out with a certain velocity the electric charge is the source of the electric field with the electric field flowing out of the charge like the velocity of the water flowing out of the tap a negative charge is similarly analogous to a water sink with electric field flowing into the negative charge as water flows into a sink figure 73 electric field of a negative point charge figures 74 and 75 show respectively the electric field of two like and unlike charges from the graphical representation of the electric field we can reach the following interesting conclusions figure 74 electric fields for like charges recall from eq  626 that the energy of the electromagnetic field at the volume element around point is given by the strength of the electric and magnetic fields namely since we are studying the case where there in only an electric field we have the energy per unit volume of the electric field in empty space is given by 77the conservation of charge implies that electric field lines must start from sources positive charges and end on sinks negative charges as shown in figures 74 and 75  the electric field lines in empty space cannot be terminated as this would imply the presence of a negative charge the conservation of charge also implies that the electric field lines cannot cross in empty space the intensity of the electric field is proportional to the amount of charge that is generating the field note from eq  77 that for every volume in space the energy of the electromagnetic field is proportional to the square of the electric field hence the energy of the electric field is proportional to its intensity at some point as well as to the extent it is spread out in space if two positive charges are brought close to each other they will repel each other hence the fields lines repel each other as shown in figure 74 consequently the field has a lower energy if the charges are moved further apart and is an expression of the repulsion of like charges if a positive and negative charge are brought close to each other we know they will attract this phenomenon is realized by electric field lines emerging from the positive charge and converging on the negative charge as shown in figure 75 since some of the electric field lines start and end on the positive and negative charges the fields energy is reduced by bringing the charges close to each other in other words the force between oppositely charged particles is attractive  figure 75 electric fields for opposite charges electric fields obey the principle of superposition we have already seen this in our discussion on interference in eq  641  if there are a number of charges namely and so on that generate electric fields and so on respectively then the net electric field due to all the charges is given by 78the full three dimensional structure of the electric field of a positive charge is shown in figure 76  figure 76 electric field due to positive charge electrostatic potential in general if charges are in the presence of an electric field they will acquire a potential energy recall that if the force is conservative then as discussed in section 37 force can be replaced by potential energy denoted by in the case of the coulomb force a direct demonstration can be made to show that it is a conservative force since force is proportional to the electric field it follows that the stationary electric field can be expressed as the gradient of the  electrostatic potential  denoted by  the force on a charge due to an electric field is given by 79and hence 710in other words the potential energy is proportional to the electrostatic potential  consider the two points with electrostatic potential the electric field is then given by 711 712the field is the negative of the gradient of the electrostatic potential so that it points from a higher value of to a lower value in keeping with the force pointing in the direction of decreasing potential figure 77 electric field from electrostatic potential since the dimensions of the electrostatic potential is given by the units for in the si system is called volts v and is given by 713in terms of volts we have a simpler expression for the units of electric field recall that in term of volts we have 714note that the electrostatic potential is not a vector rather at every point in space only a single number completely specifies the a field such as is called a scalar field clearly it is much easier to analyze a scalar field such as compared to a vector field like and this is one of the main reasons for working with potentials the contours of constant lines are plotted in figure 77 since the electrostatic force is conservative the energy of a particle at some point is independent of the path it took to get there as shown in figure 77 the difference in the energy of a charged particle is the same whether it takes path 1 or path 2 in going from the surface to the surface figure 78 shows the lines of equipotential in three dimensions the lines with a high value of are analogous to a point of high elevation for a body moving under the influence of gravity just as in gravity a mass can gain potential energy in going from a lower to a higher height a positively charged particle also gains potential energy in moving from a point with a lower to a point with a higher electrostatic potential however and this is what makes electromagnetism so different from gravity negatively charged particle loses energy in moving from a point with a lower value of to one with a higher value figure 78 equipotential surface in three dimensions a charged particle will take the shortest path in going from a point at a higher to a point at a lower potential in effect the charge moves under the force created by the electric field derived from the potential the direction of the electric field at some point on a contour points in the direction of the shortest distance to closeby contour points as shown in figure 77  the magnitude of is determined by the steepness of the contours what is the rationale for separating out the electrostatic potential from the potential energy of two charges in contrast to say gravity for which mass is always a positive quantity electric charge can either be negative or positive hence by separating off the electrostatic potential from potential we can study the field generated by a given charge and then analyze how it affects other charges suppose is generated by a positive charge a negative charge will move towards increasing values of whereas a positive charge will move towards decreasing values of as shown in figure 79 a potential that looks like a mountain to a positively charged particle looks like a crater to a negatively charged particle  figure 79 positive and negative charge moving in the same vfield recall that the fundamental irreducible charge in nature is the electron charge by convention the charge of the electron is taken to be negative and is denoted by it is a natural constant with the numerical value of in the si units given by 715the value of the electron charge is extremely small in a typical light bulb every second over electron charges enter and leave the bulbs filament protons carry charge equal to and the proton seldom enters the processes that we will be interested in the electron charge is the basis of another unit for energy the energy gained by an electron in moving from say a point with volts in figure 77 to a point with volts such that the electrostatic potential difference between the two points is 1 volt is called an electronvolt and is denoted by  we consequently have 716 717 718the electronvolt e v is the appropriate unit of energy to measure energies involved in atomic chemical and molecular biological processes the energy of a single molecule of air at room temperature is about e v potential due to point charges the potential energy of charges and separated by a distance is given by coulomb potential 719from eq  717 the electrostatic potential of a point charge is given by 720 721figure 710 shows the coulomb potential note the striking difference in the potentials due to a positive and negative charge with the positive charge giving a mountain and the negative charge yielding a valley figure 710 coulomb potential for positive and negative charge electric current resistance we have seen that a positive charge will move from a higher to a lower electrostatic potential subjecting charges to appropriate potential configurations gives us the means to control their movement the movement of electric charge is called an electric current and is denoted by the electrostatic potential is the cause and the electric current is the effect  why are we interested in electrical currents one of the overriding considerations in our study of nature is to find new forms of energy such as the electrostatic potential energy the next question that naturally arises is whether we can transform electrical energy into other forms of energy in particular can we move objects and power our homes and industries with this new form of energy recall work adds to energy and is one way of transforming energy from one form to another to do work we must apply a force on an object over some distance with the resulting work done given by movement in space under the action of the electrical force is hence essential in converting electrical energy into mechanical energy only electrical charges can be moved by electrical forces or what is the same by electric fields an electrical current is an instance of such a movement of electric charges and is therefore a necessary step in doing electrical work consider a stream of charges flowing past a fixed point consider an imaginary surface placed orthogonal to the flow of charges the flow of charge is measured by the current which is the amount of charge that flows across the surface per unit area and in unit time interval  current is given by the charge flux in time hence 722the dimensions of current is and the si unit of current is amperes denoted by  that is 723electric current in general depends on the surface through which the flow of charge is taking place in onedimension has a sign with say signifying current flowing in one direction and for flow in the opposite one conservation of charge holds good for moving charges and is expressed by the laws of current conservation if a current flowing in a wire bifurcates into two wires with currents say and then charge conservation requires 724so how does one go about creating the flow of an electrical current since we first need to get our hands on some electrons we start with a conductor say a copper wire since it has a supply of free electrons we next need to create an electric field that will exert a force on electric charges and make them move to create a constant electric field all we need to do is to create an electrostatic potential difference between two points in the wire this will in turn exert force on the charges so as to create a current if the potential difference between two points in a wire separated by distance is the electric field along the wire is then given by 725an electrical battery is a device that creates such an electrostatic potential difference called the voltage between its two terminals the battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy figure 711 shows a copper wire connected in a closed circuit with a resistance and a battery with voltage the electrostatic potential say at the positive terminal  is taken to be higher than the electrostatic potential say at the negative terminals  the voltage of the battery is the potential difference given by due to the potential difference free charges in the conductor copper wire are set in motion and yield a current in the circuit the convention in labeling the terminals of a battery means that the positive charges flows from the higher potential at the positive terminal to the lower potential at the negative terminal consider piped water that is pumped to a height and flows back to the ground the electrical current can be compared to the kinetic energy of the water as it hits the ground the battery is the analogue of the pump the potential difference created by the battery is the analogue of the height to which the water is raised the resistance is analogous to the radius of the pipe and whether it is clean or whether there is accumulation of gravel and sand in the pipe that hinders or even blocks the flow of water figure 711 a circuit with resistance and voltage what is the relation between the current in the circuit the resistance and the voltage from the analogy of water flow we expect that the larger the voltage the higher the current and the higher the value of the resistance the lower the current we hence expect that 726ohms law states that if we create a potential difference of in a conductor having resistance then a current given by eq  733 will flow in the conductor the dimension of resistance is the si unit of resistance is ohms and 727 728electrical currents can flow in vacuum as well as in a medium the resistance measures the relative ease with which a currents flows in a medium let a material of length and area have resistance of the resistivity of the material is defined by 729note has units of ohmm table 71 shows the resistivity of different kinds of material resistance also depends on temperature and increases with increasing temperature table 71 resistivity at temperature cmaterialohmmeter conductors silver copper mercury semiconductors graphite carbongermanium silicon insulators glass rubber worthy to note is that superconductors are materials whose properties are explicable only by quantum theory and have zero resistance to the flow of electrical currents conductors and insulators allow and block the flow of currents respectively and can be understood based on principles of classical physics semiconductors lie inbetween conductors and insulators and their workings are based on quantum theory conductors have electrons that are not bound to the nuclei and can hence move in response to an external electric field or a potential difference all parts of a conductor at equilibrium are at the same potential since any potential difference would cause currents to flow one can have many resistors and which can be combined in series and in parallel with the value of the resultant resistance being derivable from ohms law energy is constantly lost due to the heating of the resistance called ohmic heating how much power is expended by the battery in keeping the current flowing in the circuit in time charge of amount flows from the high electrostatic potential to the lower potential hence losing potential energy the difference in the electrostatic potential is given by the voltage of the battery namely and hence 730power is rate of loss of energy in this case of potential energy hence 731 732 733 734note that the power loss in a circuit is proportional to in other words if we reverse the flow of current the sign of will change to but the loss due to ohmic heating will be the same no matter in which direction the current flows the loss of power of the battery due to heating is not a net loss but rather an example of the transformation of energy light bulbs that use a filament emanate light when the filament is heated by the flow of current and over 95 of the power is converted into light and similarly for electric ovens and so on hence electrical currents serve as a vehicle for converting the energy expended by the battery into other forms of energy the current we have considered so far is called a d c direct current since its direction does not change an a c alternating current is one in which the current changes direction and hence its sign with some fixed frequency capacitor  storing electrical energy a device that stores electrical energy based on opposite charges is called a capacitor  storing the various forms of energy is an essential link in transforming energy from one form into another the capacitor is a device for storing electrical energy the storage of energy has another even more vital function and that is in the amplification of energy if one stores energy in small amounts and accumulates a large amount over a long time then one can arrange to release the stored energy in a short burst and in effect generate an enormous amount of power the capacitor also plays an indispensable role in integrated circuits and together with semiconductors is one of the main devices for controlling and manipulating electrical energy and charge recall the energy per unit volume of the electric field in empty space is given by to obtain the total energy of the field one has to integrate sum over the contributions of the over all points of space if the electric field has a constant value say in a finite cube with volume then from eq  743  the total energy in the electric field is given by 735in other words the electric field contributes energy for every volume element of space where it is nonzero and the total energy of the field is found by adding together the contribution to the total energy from all the volume elements of space as can be seen from the above derivation a capacitor is a device that performs an integration of the electric field and in effect integrates the energy of the electrical field the term integrated circuit partly derives its terminology from this feature of a capacitor electric charge generates electric field and hence to store electrical energy we need to collect charges into a storage device since most objects found in nature are electrically neutral to obtain electrical energy it is logical to try and store positive and negative electric charge separately  however if we bring together a large collection of positively or negatively charged particles the force of electrical repulsion is very large the charges would all tend to fly apart and an enormous amount of energy would be expended to merely keep them in place hence a more efficient arrangement for generating electric field is to bring together equal amounts of positive and negative charges but separate them so that we are not back to an electrically neutral object and this in essence is the principle behind the design of all capacitors figure 712 capacitor a parallel plate capacitor is composed out of two conducting plates placed parallel to each other and separated by a distance filled with an insulator one can let air fill up the space between the conducting plates but as shown in figure 712 a dielectric material is usually placed instead of air in order to increase the capacitance of the capacitor by charging the conducting plates with opposite charges of amount and a potential difference of amount is created a measure of how much charge is stored in a capacitor is the change in the potential difference of the capacitor if charge is placed on the conducting plates the analog of a capacitor is a water storage tank if a certain volume of water is poured into the tank  the analog of electric charge  the increase in the height of the water is the analog of the increase in potential  and is a measure of the volume of the storage tank which is the analog of capacitance  clearly the simplest case for a capacitor is when the voltage difference is proportional to the charge the proportionality constant is the capacitance of the capacitor and is denoted by not to be confused with the si unit of charge namely the coulomb  we hence have 736the si unit of capacitance is the farad denoted by we have 737 738a capacitor is charged by connecting it in a circuit with a battery with voltage as shown in figure 713 note the capacitor is shown by two parallel lines with a gap to indicate that there is an insulator between the two conducting plates a insulator in a d c circuit breaks the closed circuit with no current flowing in the circuit the conducting plate connected to the  terminal of the battery will attain the potential by the flow of electrons to the battery leaving a net charge on the conducting plate and similarly for the conducting plate connected to the  terminal it will have the potential and charge the charged capacitor will therefore have a voltage difference equal to the battery namely equal to with charges and on the two respective conducting plates after the transient process of charging is over there is no more flow of charges and the current in the circuit is zero figure 713 charging a capacitor the energy stored in a capacitor can be found by determining the electric field that has been created due to charging up of the capacitor the capacitor has a potential difference of across a distance and for now let air be placed between the conducting plates hence the electric field is constant and points from the positively to the negatively charged conductors as shown in figure 712 from eq  718  the constant electric field is given by 739the energy stored in the capacitor is from eq  744  proportional to the volume of the capacitor for conducting plates with area the energy stored in the capacitor is consequently given by 740 741 742it is known from charging up the capacitor that the total energy stored is given by 743 744hence from the above equations we see that the capacitance of a parallel plate is given by 745note that capacitance depends only on the geometrical shape of the capacitor as well as the material serving as the insulator by changing the insulator from air to a dielectric material one simply changes in the permittivity of the vacuum to that of the medium namely  obtaining the general result 746as shown in table 72 a properly chosen dielectric can increase the capacitance by a few order of magnitude table 72 some dielectric materials material vacuum air paper 35silicon 12germanium water titania ceramic 130strontium titanate one can replace the insulating dielectric in a capacitor with a semiconductor and create a more complex device that stores and discharges electrical energy depending on the state of the semiconductor rc circuit the charging and discharging of a capacitor takes place in a finite time and we briefly discuss the salient aspects of these processes consider a circuit as shown in figure 714  when the switch is closed the circuit is completed and current flows until the capacitor is fully charged after which the current ceases to flow figure 714 circuit with a battery capacitor and resistor since a capacitor gets charged in a finite amount of time the first thing one does is to look for a constant which has the dimensions of time and within an order of magnitude this would be the time taken to charge the capacitor consider the following combination 747 748 749 750again the power of dimensional analysis there is an inherent time scale in the problem namely  suppose we have a battery of voltage the charging of the capacitor commences at let the current at time be and the charge on the capacitor be the potential drop across the resistor from ohms law is and the potential drop across the capacitance is  at time the total drop across the circuit elements must equal the voltage of the battery and is given by 751also 752 753the charge on the capacitor plates is zero when the charging starts and at final time of the charge reaches the equilibrium value of in other words 754by direct substitution one can verify that 755 756 757 758where in obtaining last equation above we have used  eqn  771 is a typical case of an exponential dependence on time for that is for time much larger than the characteristic time for a capacitor to a very good approximation the current is zero one can conclude that for all practical purposes the charging is over seconds after the the charging starts to discharge the capacitor the same circuit as the one for charging is used except that one removes the battery the capacitor is first charged and then at the switch is closed connecting the positive and negative plates of the capacitor through a resistor  it can be shown by an analysis similar to the one for charging the capacitor that the charge and current on the capacitor at time is given by 759 760similar to the discussion on the charging of a capacitor from the equation above we conclude that the capacitor is fully discharged in seconds after the start of the discharging process magnetic fields magnetic fields are ubiquitous in nature magnetic fields appear everywhere in astrophysics spinning black holes generate very strong magnetic fields that cause intense xray radiation from charged objects that fall into it magnetic fields determine the properties of quasars and neutron stars as well as erupting as magnetic storms during solar flares the earths mild magnetic field has been known since antiquity and magnetic fields manifest in more subtle forms as permanent magnets in electric motors and electric power generators in permanent magnetic information storage devices and down to the quantized magnetic fields that are trapped in superconducting material magnetism is one of the less known wonders of nature magnetic fields are more difficult to study than electric fields unlike the electric field that for the stationary case is reducible to the much simpler scalar electrostatic potential magnetic fields even for the simplest stationary cases can only be represented by vectors the ultimate reason for the asymmetry between electric and magnetic fields is that unlike electric charges nature chooses not to have any magnetic charges  otherwise known as magnetic monopoles instead of being generated by magnetic charges all magnetic fields in nature are generated by moving charges given the complexity of the magnetic field b we will study only two examples as these illustrate the intimate connection of the electric and magnetic fields recall from eq  632 that the units of the magnetic field b is given by newton per coulombmetersec which is abbreviated to tesla t we have 761 762table 73 gives the strengths of the magnetic fields typically encountered in nature table 73 some approximate magnetic fields phenomena magnetic field at neutron stars surface large electromagnet small bar magnet at earths surface quantum flux of magnetic field detectable magnetic field magnetic fields are most commonly experienced in the form of permanent magnets which have a south s and a north n pole lines of magnetic field emanate from the north pole and converge on the south pole similar to charge like poles repel and opposite poles attract since in the final analysis there are no magnetic monopoles the permanent bar magnets are the result of microscopic electric currents that generate the observed magnetic fields magnetic field due to a current a moving charge creates a magnetic field consider the example of a current flowing along an infinitely long wire lying along the axis from the symmetry of the problem the magnetic field can only point in two directions namely either radially outwards from the wire or in concentric circles girdling the wire since magnetic monopoles do not exist the field cannot emanate from the wire hence the magnetic field must form concentric circles about the wire if one has a current in a closed loop as shown in figure 715 the generated magnetic field looks like the magnetic field of a permanent magnet with one side the north pole and the other the south pole figure 715 curlooeps the direction of the magnetic field can either be clockwise or counterclockwise with respect to the direction of flow of the current amperes law determines the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field due to a current if one points ones right hand thumb along the direction of the current then points along the direction of the curled fingers what is the magnitude of again from the symmetry of the problem b can depend only on the orthogonal distance from the wire and should fall off to zero at a large distance from the wire let the orthogonal distance from the wire be denoted by  amperes law then yields 763 764 765we have obtained the field that is created by a current a magnetic field external to the current namely can exerts a force on a current suppose the particles in the current carry charge and are traveling at a velocity of then the force exerted on the charged particle by as indicated in eq  637  is given by 766if two currents are brought close to each other they will exert a magnetic force due to the operation of the above equation current due to a magnetic field we have seen that currents can generate magnetic fields by a relation of reciprocity we expect correctly that a changing magnetic fields in turn should also generate electric currents consider a closed circuit with an ammeter that measures electric current if one moves a magnet in and out of the circuit the ammeter registers an oscillating current which ceases the moment the magnet stops moving such a current is called an induced electric current to understand this phenomenon we need to first understand the idea of magnetic flux denoted by suppose we have a constant magnetic field pointing in the direction we draw a closed circuit or contour loop in say the plane of area the magnetic flux going through the area is then given by 767in other words magnetic flux measures the amount of field flowing through an area  faradays law of induction explains the phenomenon of an induced current the change of magnetic flux through a closed circuit induces an emf in the circuit the emf drives a current in a circuit and is the result of a changing magnetic field inducing an electric field the induced electric field does not arise from charges and hence the emf is not the same as the voltage for stationary electric fields discussed earlier suppose that in time interval the flux changes by if the circuit has  turns of the wire the induced emf is then given by 768we apply faradays law to a simple example consider a constant magnetic field say due to a permanent magnet pointing in the direction suppose for simplicity that the field in the direction and has been shown in figure 716 by crosses indicating that the field points into the paper the field extends from towards the positive axis as shown in figure 716  figure 716 emfeps insert a rectangular loop of wire having resistance a and width and with a distance inside the field we apply a force along the negative axis to pull the loop of wire out of the field at a constant velocity it is easy to show lenzs law that the current induced in the wire is such as to create a field that opposes the force since otherwise we could violate energy conservation the power being expended by the force in moving the wire loop is 769the flux at an instant is given by 770 771 772ignoring a minus sign we have from eq  781  773 774we have a circuit in which an emf is driving a current one should note that unlike the stationary case where a potential difference drove a current in the circuit in the case of induced emf we have time dependent electric and magnetic fields and hence the electric field can no longer be reduced to an electrostatic potential since we have a circuit with a current we can still apply ohms law to obtain 775the rate of heating gives the power being expended in keeping the current flowing and is given by 776 777from energy conservation the power expended in pulling the wire loop out of the magnetic field must exactly equal the energy appearing as ohmic heating and this can be proven if devices are placed in the circuit which are driven by the current energy conservation then requires that additional mechanical energy will be required to pull the wire out of the magnetic field the point of the exercise is to illustrate the essential principles of an electric power generator that transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy using the properties of magnetic fields we can transform mechanical work into electrical energy as embodied in the induced current the crucial point to note is that without any mechanical contact the magnetic field acts as an intermediate agency in transforming mechanical energy involved in pulling out the wire loop into an induced emf and a consequent electrical current this catalytic role of magnetic fields is a rich resource for the invention of new devices and technologies maxwells equations the discussion in chapters 7 and 6 all revolved around a piece meal exposition of maxwells equations we summarize our discussion here so as to unify our understanding of electromagnetism so what are the maxwells equations they can be enumerated in the following manner electric fields are generated by positively and negatively charged particles we discussed the relation of electric field to charge in sections 73 and 72  a changing magnetic field generates an induced electric field in section 79 this equation of maxwell was called faradays law of induction and we derived the emf and induced electric current from a time varying magnetic field there is no magnetic monopole this is an experimental fact that continues to hold an electric current or a changing electric field gives rise to an induced magnetic field in section 78 we studied the induced magnetic field due to a current note that the second and fourth of maxwells equations explain the phenomenon of electromagnetic radiation since as mentioned earlier in empty space a changing electric field induces a magnetic field which in turn induces an electric field and so on and provides the mechanism for the propagation of radiation over virtually infinitely large distances just to give a sense of how important are maxwells equations we quote richard feynman from a long view of the history of mankind  seen from say ten thousand years from now  there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as maxwells discovery of the laws of electrodynamics next entropy up laws of physics  previous electromagnetic radiation light contents marakani srikant 20000911
