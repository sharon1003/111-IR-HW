genetic fact sheets for parents amino acid disorders disorder name phenylketonuria acronym pkuwhat is pku what causes pku if pku is not treated what problems occur what is the treatment for pku what happens when pku is treated what causes the pah enzyme to be absent or not working correctly how is pku inherited is genetic testing available what other testing is available can you test during pregnancy can other members of the family have pku or be carriers can other family members be tested how many people have pku does pku happen more often in a certain ethnic group does pku go by any other names where can i find more information this fact sheet contains general information about pku every child is different and some of these facts may not apply to your child specifically certain treatments may be advised for some children but not others all children with pku should be followed by a metabolic doctor in addition to their primary care provider if your newborn has had a ‘presumptive positive screen for pku’ as a result of newborn screening it does not yet mean that he or she has pku there are other tests that need to be done to confirm whether your baby actually has pku some babies are found not to have pku and do not need treatment others are found to have a milder condition called “hyperphenylalaninemia”  also called ‘hyperphe’ or ‘nonpku hpa’ many children with nonpku hpa do not need treatment there is also another form of nonpku hpa that is treated with a medication called bh4 tetrahydrobiopterin this condition is rare less than 2 of cases blood and urine tests can be done to determine whether your child has this form of nonpku hyperphe this fact sheet contains information about classic pku only therefore the details below are relevant only to babies who have been confirmed to have classic pku it does not contain information on nonpku hpa or other variants what is pku pku stands for “phenylketonuria” it is one type of amino acid disorder people with pku have problems breaking down an amino acid called phenylalanine from the food they eat amino acid disorders amino acid disorders aas are a group of rare inherited conditions they are caused by enzymes that do not work properly protein is made up of smaller building blocks called amino acids a number of different enzymes are needed to process these amino acids for use by the body because of missing or nonworking enzymes people with amino acid disorders cannot process certain amino acids these amino acids along with other toxic substances then build up in the body and cause problems the symptoms and treatment vary between different amino acid disorders they can also vary from person to person with the same amino acid disorder see the fact sheets for each specific amino acid disorder amino acid disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and affect both males and females what causes pku in order for the body to use protein from the food we eat it is broken down into smaller parts called amino acids special enzymes then make changes to the amino acids so the body can use them pku occurs when an enzyme called “phenylalanine hydroxylase” pah is either missing or not working properly the job of this enzyme is to chemically change the amino acid phenylalanine phe – pronounced ‘fee’ into other substances when a child with pku eats food containing phe it builds up in the blood and causes problems phe is found in almost every food except pure fat and sugar if pku is not treated what problems occur babies with pku seem perfectly normal at birth the first effects are usually seen around 6 months of age untreated infants may be late in learning to sit crawl and stand they may pay less attention to things around them without treatment a child with pku will have intellectual disabilities some of the effects of untreated pku includeintellectual disabilitiesbehavior problemshyperactivityrestlessness or irritabilityseizuresa skin condition called eczemaa “musty” or “mousy” body odorfair hair and skin what is the treatment for pku your baby’s primary doctor will work with a metabolic doctor and a dietician experienced with pku to care for your child prompt treatment is needed to prevent intellectual disabilities newborns need to drink a special medical formula it is still possible to breastfeed your baby as long as you get help from your dietician babies who are breastfed usually need the medical formula as well most children need to eat a special diet made up of very lowprotein foods special medical foods and the special formula you must start the lowphe diet as soon as you know your child has pku your dietician will create a food plan that contains the right amount of protein nutrients and energy to keep your child healthy the diet should be continued throughout life the following are treatments often advised for children with pku1 medical formula even though they need less phe children with pku still need a certain amount of protein the medical formula gives babies and children with pku the nutrients and protein they need while helping keep their phe levels within a safe range your metabolic doctor and dietician will tell you what type of formula is best and how much to use some states offer help with payment or require private insurance coverage for the formula and other special medical foods2 lowphe food plan the lowphe food plan is made up of foods that are very low in phe this means your child must avoid or strictly limit the following foodsmilk and all dairy products including cheese yogurt ice creamregular formulameat and poultryfisheggsnuts and peanut butterdried beansregular flour it is very important that your child avoid the sugar substitute aspartame sold under the brand names “equal” nutrasweet” “sweetmate” “canderal” aspartame contains high amounts of phe it can quickly raise the blood levels of phe in people with pku your child must not have any diet foods or drinks that contain aspartame some medicines and vitamins also contain aspartame if you’re not sure ask your pharmacist metabolic doctor or dietician many vegetables and fruits have only small amounts of phe and can be eaten in carefully measured amounts in addition there are other medical foods such as lowphe flours baking mixes breads and pastas that are made especially for people with pku your child’s food plan will depend on many things such as his or her age weight general health and blood test results your dietician will finetune your child’s diet over time your child should follow this diet throughout life adults who do not stay on the diet and have high levels of phe in their blood may notice some of the followingtrouble paying attentionproblems making good decisionsslow thinkingirritabilityeczemabone loss osteopeniatremors women need to be on the lowphe diet before becoming pregnant they need to stay on the diet throughout pregnancy this will lessen the chance for serious health and learning problems in their babies3 tracking phe levels babies and young children with pku need to have regular blood tests to measure their phe levels if there is too much or too little phe in the blood the diet and formula may need to be adjusted4 bh4 supplements bh4 tetrahydrobiopterin is a substance made by the body it works to help the pah enzyme change phe into tyr some children with pku will benefit from taking bh4 supplements in pill form this treatment is helpful in reducing blood phe levels in some children with pku about 10 of children with classic pku respond to bh4 pills most children with mild pku are helped by bh4 pills your doctor can do blood tests to determine whether your child responds to bh4 supplements do not take this supplement unless advised by your metabolic doctor5 pregnancy in women with pku “maternal pku” women with pku who are not on the lowphe diet when they become pregnant have a high chance of having babies with birth defects and intellectual disabilities women who are not on the diet usually have high levels of phe in their blood the extra phe gets to the fetus and causes problems with brain and body growth babies of untreated mothers may have the followingsmall brainsintellectual disabilitiesbirth defects of the heartlow birth weight this condition is called “ maternal pku syndrome ” women with pku who want to have children need to have very low blood phe levels before they get pregnant during pregnancy they need tostay on the lowphe dietvisit their pku clinic on a regular basishave their blood phe levels checked often what happens when pku is treated children with pku who start treatment soon after birth and keep their phe levels within the suggested range usually have normal growth and intelligence some children even when treated have problems with school work and may need extra help if treatment is not started until several weeks after birth delays or learning problems may occur the level of delay varies from child to child children who start treatment after 6 months of age often have intellectual disabilities treatment is still important even if started late because it can help control behavior and mood problems and can prevent further damage to the brain what causes the pah enzyme to be absent or not working correctly genes tell the body to make various enzymes people with pku have a pair of genes that do not work correctly because of the changes in this pair of genes the pah enzyme either does not work properly or is not made at all how is pku inherited pku is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner it affects both boys and girls equally everyone has a pair of genes that make the pah enzyme in children with pku neither of these genes works correctly these children inherit one nonworking gene for the condition from each parent parents of children with pku rarely have the condition themselves instead each parent has a single nonworking gene for pku they are called carriers carriers do not have pku because the other gene of this pair is working correctly when both parents are carriers there is a 25 chance in each pregnancy for the child to have pku there is a 50 chance for the child to be a carrier just like the parents and there is a 25 chance for the child to have two working genes genetic counseling is available to families who have children with pku genetic counselors can answer your questions about how pku is inherited choices during future pregnancies and how to test other family members ask your doctor about a referral to a genetic counselor is genetic testing available genetic testing for pku can be done on a blood sample genetic testing also called dna testing looks for changes in the pair of genes that causes pku dna testing is not necessary to diagnose your child it is sometimes helpful to know the gene changes in a child with pku because it may help the doctors and dietician develop the best treatment plan it is sometimes of help in determining which children will respond to biopterin supplements it can also be helpful for carrier or prenatal testing discussed below what other testing is available pku is confirmed by measuring the amount of phe and tyr in a blood sample talk to your doctor or your genetic counselor if you have questions about testing for pku can you test during pregnancy if both gene changes have been found in your child with pku dna testing can be done during future pregnancies the sample needed for this test is obtained by either cvs or amniocentesis parents may choose to have testing during pregnancy or wait until birth to have the baby tested a genetic counselor can talk to you about your choices and answer questions about prenatal testing or testing your baby after birth can other members of the family have pku or be carriers having pku if they are healthy and developing normally older brothers and sisters of a baby with pku are unlikely to have pku talk to your doctor or genetic counselor if you have questions about your other children pku carriers brothers and sisters who do not have pku still have a 23rds chance to be carriers like their parents except in special cases carrier testing should only be done in people over 18 years of age each of the parents’ brothers and sisters has a 50 chance to be a carrier it is important for other family members to be told that they could be carriers there is a small chance they are also at risk to have children with pku all states offer newborn screening for pku however when both parents are carriers newborn screening results are not sufficient to rule out the condition in a newborn baby in this casespecial diagnostic testing should be done in addition to newborn screening it is very important that this testing be done immediatiately – ideally at 24 hours of age can other family members be tested diagnostic testing if there is concern about whether they have the condition your other children can be tested talk to your doctor or genetic counselor if you have questions about testing for pku carrier testing if both gene changes have been found in your child other family members can have dna testing to see if they are carriers if dna testing is not helpful other methods of carrier testing may be available if you have questions about carrier testing ask your genetic counselor or metabolic doctor how many people have pku about one in every 10000 caucasian babies in the united states is born with pku does pku happen more frequently in a certain ethnic group pku happens in people of all ethnic groups around the world it happens more often in people whose families come from ireland and other parts of northern europe it is also more common in people from turkey and those who are native americans pku is less common in people of african japanese or ashkenazi jewish backgrounds about 1 in every 50 caucasians is a pku carrier does pku go by any other names pku is sometimes also calledhyperphenylalaninemia – classic typephenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency pah deficiency some variants of hyperphenylalaniemia not discussed in this fact sheet arehyperphenylalanemia – mild type non pkuhpabiopterin deficiencydihydropteridine reductase dhpr deficiency guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase gtpch deficiency6pyruvoyl tetrahydrobiopterin synthase ptps deficiency pterin4
