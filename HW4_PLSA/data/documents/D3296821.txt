surfactants alkyl ether sulfates alkyl ether sulfates result from the sulfation of an ethoxylated fatty alcohol ethoxylation is the process by which ethylene oxide is added to a fatty acid alcohol to create detergent properties in a surfactant if you compare the molecule above to that of sls from yesterday youll see that little oxygen o atom is messing up the clean squiggliness of the carbon chain thats the ether part of the process  ethers are a type of organic molecule that contains an oxygen joining two alkyl groups you can see how the oxygen is in the middle implying it is connecting stuff alkyl ether sulfates  like sodium laureth sulfate sle s  have good foam stability in hard water good skin tolerance less irritation and are easily thickened by salt crothix or glycol distearate they are also thickened by adding cocamidopropyl betaine it is considered a mild cleanser definitely milder than sls you can find sle s in two forms  sle s 2 eo or sle s 2 mole and sle s 3 eo or sle s 3 mole this eo part is about the ethoxylation of the surfactant the higher the ethoxylation the less irritating it will be for your skin or eyes and the more soluble in water youll also find different concentrations of the amount of sle s in your bottle i use stepan steol cs230 c lick here for the data bulletin sheet for steol cs230  which contains 26 active sle s and is a 2 mole version it has a p h of 6 to 75 and a freezing point of 2Ëšc for sle s we find mild to moderate skin irritation at 10 active so if you used 40 sle s in your body wash youd get 104 active sle s in your product which could cause some mild skin irritation you wouldnt want to use that much of one surfactant in any product so its safe to say that this is a less irritating surfactant than sls and on par with most of the others well be investigatingwere also seeing ammonium laureth sulfate gaining in popularity it has all the qualities of sle s  good foaming and stability in hard water better skin tolerance good thickening with salts  with a little more mildness it is considered a gentle to mild cleanser stepans steol ca230 is 25 active with 15 required for mild to moderate skin irritation which means you need to use 60 before you get that to that amount it has a p h of 65 either of these surfactants would be suitable for most if not all skin types the more sensitive skin types might prefer ale s over sle s because of its increased mildness i enjoy using both sle s and ale s in my creations so here are a few ideas for formulating with alkyl ether sulfatesgardeners hand scrub moisturizing body wash with oils household surface cleanser with dlimonene body wash with honeyquat join me tomorrow for more fun with the sulfatesposted by susan barclaynichols at 63300 am email this blog this share to twitter share to facebook share to pinterest labels surfactants
