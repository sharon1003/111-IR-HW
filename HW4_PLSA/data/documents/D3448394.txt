how did sugar come to mean diabetes march 6 2010 832 am subscribe so what do you know about sugar sugar diabetes or the sugar being used as synonyms for diabetes and how did that meaning come to be exactly a friends facebook post has piqued my curiosity about people using sugar or phrases that include the word sugar as a synonym for diabetes mellitus this usage is pretty alien to me personally but according to this post on everything2 its used widely in eastern north america in canada as well as in the south however a preliminary google and wikipedia search yields little so im wondering if any of you have either firsthand knowledge of people using sugar in this way and whowhere or can point me to resources either online or offline such as books or articles by linguists that could elucidate the range origins andor evolution of this usage im especially interested in how diabetes evolved in folk usage to sugar and what the stages were along the way did it have multiple independent origins or did it start in one small area and spread everywhere else is there a class or ethnic dimension im also interested in the firsthand accounts as that could help build a picture albeit anecdotal of how widespread this usage really is or wasposted by skoosh to writing  language 32 answers total 4 users marked this as a favorite my grandmother used the terms sugar or sugar diabetes way back in eastern ky she was born in 1919 or 1920 we had varying stories people living out that way still do use that term from what i see at work in medical histories id think sugar might be an older usage than diabetes mellitus in english actually although its just a guess diabetics can have sugar in their urine and that used to be one of the main tests for the disease posted by dilettante at 843 am on march 6 2010my grandparents and their peers use this terminology in ohio posted by runningwithscissors at 846 am on march 6 2010my mother from new york city born in 1940 called it sugar diabetes posted by deadmessenger at 850 am on march 6 2010my mother used the phrase sugar diabetes she was from the midwest iowa to be more precise she also used the phrase salt diabetes which ive never heard anybody else use i have no idea what that meant to her or what she was trying to convey ive since read that it wasis a laypersons term for describing hypernatremia associated with uncontrolled diabetes so perhaps thats what she had in mind posted by arachnid at 851 am on march 6 2010my parents eastern ohionorthern wv who are in the late 60s and their siblings 70s all use this slang interchangeable with diabetes anecdotally they seem to use sugar more amongst themselves and use diabetes when talking to someone younger or to someone they dont know as well posted by mmascolino at 853 am on march 6 2010if it helps at all in armenian you say i have sugar to mean diabetic used to get out of pressure to eat sweets posted by k8t at 856 am on march 6 2010  1 favoriteim from sarajevo bosnia and in serbocroatian we say the equivalent of sugar diabetes colloquially additionally the word i learned for diabetes in hungarian is cukorbaj which breaks down as sugar trouble or sugar problem cukor  sugar and baj  trouble so id suspect this isnt a regionalism in english as much as a reflection of how diabetes was referred to in many languages posted by dee xtrovert at 858 am on march 6 2010my grandparents arkansasarmytexas caucasian born in the early 20s used sugar diabetes or the sugar diabetes and at least for my grandmother it was practically one word im not sure i ever heard her just say diabetes or use the term diabetic even when discussing my grandfathers condition with medical professionals or my dietician aunts work in dialysis centers i am fairly confident that i could use the phrase with at least anyone around my age late 30s or older who grew up southern or had lived in the south long enough and they would know what i meant and also recognize it as an oldfashioned terminology posted by lyn never at 906 am on march 6 2010i have sometimes spoke with patients that call dm some variant of sugars they are usually older occasionally either 1st or 2ndgeneration immigrants from the southern part of the us and almost always from lower ses or more commonly when doing a family history they will tell me of their parents of grandparents who had sugars posted by meehawl at 921 am on march 6 2010i grew up in queens ny have moved around the country a fair bit and now live in oakland ca ive only ever heard the term sugar used to refer to diabetes by my neighbors in the africanamerican community i suspect this may be related to the southern angle related in replies above posted by piratebartenderzombiemonkey at 921 am on march 6 2010in germany people call it zucker sugar or zuckerkrankheit sugar disease this is a layman expression mainly used by older people posted by the toad at 925 am on march 6 2010great answers so far okay so far weve established that the sugardiabetes usage is not limited to english or even indoeuropean languages so thats a pretty strong indication of multiple independent origins id say im thinking that since diabetes mellitus literally means something like excessive discharge of sweet urine in medical greek diabetesexcessive urination literally siphon and mellitussweet or honeyed in the midst of the transition from referring to the disease as diabetes mellitus to simply diabetes the word sugar got applied as a way of distinguishing diabetes mellitus from other kinds of diabetes not many people know what mellitus means so one could substitute the word sugar instead and apparently they did so in many different languages and then from sugar diabetes we could get the sugar trouble or the sugar or simply sugar in the meantime theres a parallel development from diabetes mellitus to diabetes – possibly with sugar diabetes as an intermediate term sorry for answering my own question but i definitely needed to get that input about usage in other languages before getting to this point and of course this is still just amateur speculation at this point if anyone knows of an actual study or research paper about it that would be awesome posted by skoosh at 938 am on march 6 2010it was also traditionally used in rural upstate new york and new england including by country doctors when talking to patients the actual incidence of diabetes where i grew up seems to me to be less common now that there is more migration posted by jgirl at 944 am on march 6 2010oh and it looks like the sugar usage is gradually getting edged out in rural lowerprestige dialects by the diabetes term from higherprestige standard dialects used more often by older more rural people understood by middleaged people but also recognized as an oldfashioned term not used very much by younger people just judging from the total lack of firstperson i say the sugar to mean diabetes responses whats fascinating to me is that according to the toads comment this is a crosslinguistic phenomenon – zuckerkrankheit is apparently being replaced by diabetes in german as well posted by skoosh at 953 am on march 6 2010i dont know for sure but i have always assumed and you know how they say to never assume that it went something like this doctor to newly diagnoses patient you are diabetic patient what does that mean doctor your blood glucose is too high patient whats glucose doctor its like sugar in your blood the patient then leaves the doctors office and says to anybody who cares to listen i have sugar diabetes if somewhere down the road that same patient loses his toes to diabetes he might then say i got sugar diabetes and the sugar settled in my toes and i had to get them cut off posted by uncle chaos at 1008 am on march 6 2010when i was growing up detroit area almost all the adults i knew called it sugar diabetes and a lot of them used the wilford brimley pronunciation diabeetus some of the africanamerican adults i knew called it sweet blood or the sugar my fatherinlaw rural georgia sometimes calls it sugar would you bring me my sugar medicine from the fridge posted by oriole adams at 1026 am on march 6 2010when asking elderly relatives 70s100s back in eastern canada nova scotia how family members from past generations died they would state they had had the sugars a few of their decedents still refer to it as that but i am unaware if that is used culturally there anymore posted by beautifulcheese at 1058 am on march 6 2010interesting addition to this question is the hybrid term sugarbetes heard on the 1132007 brian williamsfeist episode of saturday night live kenan thompson plays a nanny who is commenting on the costumes kids wear today on halloween the other night a girl came by my house dressed as a nurse with her blussums exposed i told her dont you be defaming nurses nurses are heroes i had one of them take good care of me when my sugarbetes flaired up and you know if it wasnt for nurses barbara birmingham might only have one foot so im guessing that kenan thompson heard people in his life using the phrase sugar diabetes and conflated the words posted by inturnaround at 1134 am on march 6 2010im not sure you should fix so strongly on the theory that this derives from the mellitus part of diabetes mellitus after all the condition is a problem with the metabolism of glucose and the term could simply be purely descriptive in origin just to confirm what other posters have indicated in the midatlantic south i would definitely associate the usage with older speakers of lowprestige sociolects especially rural people and aavespeakers posted by strangely stunted trees at 1147 am on march 6 2010my relatives in india call it sugar too they all know at least a bit of english most of them speak it fluently so they call it sugar in english i dont think ive ever heard anyone call it by the hindi word for sugar posted by asras at 1157 am on march 6 2010pretty much a slang term much like slim used in central africa to refer to aids posted by yclipse at 1228 pm on march 6 2010before the science was better older folks diabetes management avoided sweets instead of carbohydrates i remember my grandmother talking about her sugar middleclass new england white woman by way of newfoundland posted by fairytale of los angeles at 1230 pm on march 6 2010hi type ii diabetic here it really really really sounds like youre over thinking this the inability to properly deal with glucose ie sugar is the problem with diabetes so it doesnt seem like a stretch to see the term sugar used as a synonym glucose is a medical term unused by many sugar is a familiar word and term also what uncle chaos and fairytale of los angeles said the latter of which i think still applies a today most people dont really have the first clue about diabetes but always seem to get hooked on the sugar aspect ie omg you cant have cookies ever i would die interesting note was sitting in a room with other diabetics in savannah ga recently most of them were older than me say anywhere between 45 and 60 our health insurance copy was showing us various ad campaigns to get diabetics interested in several programs targeted towards health one of the campaigns used the term the sugar we universally hated that term the last thing we wanted to be reminded of is sugar posted by brandon blatcher at 1246 pm on march 6 2010datapoint sockersjuka sugar sickness in sweden diabetes has more or less replaced this phrase posted by iteki at 124 pm on march 6 2010so diabetes mellitus was named way back when by some greek guy but that doesnt mean everyone suddenly had that greek phrase added to their vocab im having a hard time formulating what i want to say partly because its more a gut feeling than anything but it sounds to me as if youre thinking these poor people out in the sticks were just not clever enough to use the proper terminology when they heard it from their doctors im just not sure thats how it worked at all i mean its possible that the sugars etc is the baseline not diabetes mellitus that is was thought up to describe personal observation just as dm was thought up look at all the other languages represented here that use the samesimilar phraseology it seems to me that people who maybe didnt go to the doctor a lot isolated poor rudimentary professional medicine available if any at all but who were clever enough to see a patternand were all pattern recognition monkeys noput two and two together and realized that those folks who have the sugary piss actually have a disease its the sugar disease sugar sickness sweet urine diabetes mellitus its all the same its descriptive now were in an era when languageusage is becoming more homogeneous and official medical terms more common so the correct term is supplanting the common one i have no concrete evidence to support this view though it would be interesting to know for certain its language though so    posted by miss patrish at 241 pm on march 6 2010now were in an era when languageusage is becoming more homogeneous and official medical terms more common so the correct term is supplanting the common one its already been demonstrated that variants of terms like the sugars and sugar trouble are the accepted words for diabetes in many languages and though i am sure many of them now also use the term diabetes this is probably simply because it sounds more medical and is in all fairness a bit more precise than sugar trouble but its kind of a shame that the old correct term has been replaced by a new correct term that makes less sense to laymen posted by dee xtrovert at 303 pm on march 6 2010here it is being used in 1884 in an ad for snake oil and in 1880 by a doctor posted by the corpse in the library at 351 pm on march 6 2010used more often by older more rural people understood by middleaged people but also recognized as an oldfashioned term its also used in spanish azúcar in the same way you describe posted by clearlydemon at 507 pm on march 6 2010the toad in germany people call it zucker sugar or zuckerkrankheit sugar disease this is a layman expression mainly used by older people the icelandic word for diabetes mellitus is sykursýki which is the same as the german formulation but this is also the technical medical term for it diabetes is not used in icelandic also sugar sickness is apparently well understood enough for the new york times to use that term in a headline though its also a play on words posted by kattullus at 617 pm on march 6 2010check out the wikipeida article on diabetes which goes over the history of the disease every culture seems to have named the disease based on it being related to sweetness from there its easy to see how the sugar name and all its variants would come about posted by brandon blatcher at 842 pm on march 6 2010one way of diagnosing diabetes back in the day was to take some of the patients urine and pour it on a relatively clean nonporous surface outside like a back porch if puddle drew ants andor flies  puddle had sugar in it  sugar diabetes no ants  no sugar in the urine on preview what the wikipedia article says posted by lambchop1 at 854 pm on march 6 2010my grandparents grew up in upstate ny and always said that people had the sugar also my fil had diabetes and grew up in new england  he always told people he had sugar both of these groups would now be in their 80s90s and most of them would say diabetes if they are talking to a medical professional but still
