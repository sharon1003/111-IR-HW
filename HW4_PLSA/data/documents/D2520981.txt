published the horse  equus ferus caballus 2 3 is one of two extant subspecies of equus ferus it is an oddtoed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family equidae the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multitoed creature eohippus into the large singletoed animal of today humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 bc and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 bc horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses these feral populations are not true wild horses as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated such as the endangered przewalskis horse a separate subspecies and the only remaining true wild horse there is an extensive specialized vocabulary used to describe equinerelated concepts covering everything from anatomy to life stages size colors markings breeds locomotion and behavior horses anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a welldeveloped sense of balance and a strong fightorflight response related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults 4 female horses called mares carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse called a foal can stand and run shortly following birth most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four they reach full adult development by age five and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament spirited hot bloods with speed and endurance cold bloods such as draft horses and some ponies suitable for slow heavy work and  warmbloods  developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes particularly in europe there are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today developed for many different uses horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and noncompetitive recreational pursuits as well as in working activities such as police work agriculture entertainment and therapy horses were historically used in warfare from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed using many different styles of equipment and methods of control many products are derived from horses including meat milk hide hair bone and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares humans provide domesticated horses with food water and shelter as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers

lifespan and life stages depending on breed management and environment the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years 7 uncommonly a few animals live into their 40s and occasionally beyond 8 the oldest verifiable record was  old billy  a 19thcentury horse that lived to the age of 62 7 in modern times sugar puff who had been listed in guinness world records as the worlds oldest living pony died in 2007 at age 56 9regardless of a horse or ponys actual birth date for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each january 1 of each year in the northern hemisphere 7 10 and each august 1 in the southern hemisphere 11 the exception is in endurance riding where the minimum age to compete is based on the animals actual calendar age 12the following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages foal a horse of either sex less than one year old a nursing foal is sometimes called a suckling and a foal that has been weaned is called a weanling 13 most domesticated foals are weaned at five to seven months of age although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects 14yearling a horse of either sex that is between one and two years old 15colt a male horse under the age of four 16 a common terminology error is to call any young horse a colt when the term actually only refers to young male horses 17filly a female horse under the age of four 13mare a female horse four years old and older 18stallion a noncastrated male horse four years old and older 19 the term horse is sometimes used colloquially to refer specifically to a stallion 20gelding a castrated male horse of any age 13in horse racing these definitions may differ for example in the british isles thoroughbred horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old 21 however australian thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less than four years old 22size and measurement the height of horses is usually measured at the highest point of the withers where the neck meets the back 23 this point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy unlike the head or neck which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse in englishspeaking countries the height of horses is often stated in units of hands and inches one hand is equal to 4 inches 1016 mm the height is expressed as the number of full hands followed by a point then the number of additional inches and ending with the abbreviation h or hh for hands high thus a horse described as 152 h is 15 hands plus 2 inches for a total of 62 inches 1575 cm in height 24size varies greatly among horse breeds as with this fullsized horse and small pony the size of horses varies by breed but also is influenced by nutrition light riding horses usually range in height from 14 to 16 hands 56 to 64 inches 142 to 163 cm and can weigh from 380 to 550 kilograms 840 to 1210 lb 25 larger riding horses usually start at about 152 hands 62 inches 157 cm and often are as tall as 17 hands 68 inches 173 cm weighing from 500 to 600 kilograms 1100 to 1320 lb 26 heavy or draft horses are usually at least 16 hands 64 inches 163 cm high and can be as tall as 18 hands 72 inches 183 cm high they can weigh from about 700 to 1000 kilograms 1540 to 2200 lb 27the largest horse in recorded history was probably a shire horse named mammoth who was born in 1848 he stood 212 1⁄ 4 hands 8625 inches 219 cm high and his peak weight was estimated at 1524 kilograms 3360 lb 28 the current record holder for the worlds smallest horse is thumbelina a fully mature miniature horse affected by dwarfism she is 17 in 43 cm tall and weighs 57 lb 26 kg 29ponies main article pony ponies are taxonomically the same animals as horses the distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height especially for competition purposes however height alone is not dispositive the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype including conformation and temperament the traditional standard for height of a horse or a pony at maturity is 142 hands 58 inches 147 cm an animal 142 h or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than 142 h a pony 30 but there are many exceptions to the traditional standard in australia ponies are considered to be those under 14 hands 56 inches 142 cm 31 for competition in the western division of the united states equestrian federation the cutoff is 141 hands 57 inches 145 cm 32 the international federation for equestrian sports the world governing body for horse sport uses metric measurements and defines a pony as being any horse measuring less than 148 centimetres 5827 in at the withers without shoes which is just over 142 h and 149 centimetres 5866 in or just over 142½ h with shoes 33height is not the sole criterion for distinguishing horses from ponies breed registries for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 142 h consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height 34 conversely some pony breeds may have features in common with horses and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 142 h but are still considered to be ponies 35ponies often exhibit thicker manes tails and overall coat they also have proportionally shorter legs wider barrels heavier bone shorter and thicker necks and short heads with broad foreheads they may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers 30 small size by itself is not an exclusive determinant for example the shetland pony which averages 10 hands 40 inches 102 cm is considered a pony 30 conversely breeds such as the falabella and other miniature horses which can be no taller than 30 inches 76 cm are classified by their registries as very small horses not ponies 36genetics horses have 64 chromosomes 37 the horse genome was sequenced in 2007 it contains 27 billion dna base pairs 38 which is larger than the dog genome but smaller than the human genome or the bovine genome 39 the map is available to researchers 40colors and markings bay left and chestnut sometimes called sorrel are two of the most common coat colors seen in almost all breeds main articles equine coat color equine coat color genetics and horse markings horses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings described by a specialized vocabulary often a horse is classified first by its coat color before breed or sex 41 horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings 42 which along with various spotting patterns are inherited separately from coat color 43many genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color 44 and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits the basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the melanocortin 1 receptor 45 also known as the extension gene or red factor 44 as its recessive form is red chestnut and its dominant form is black 46 additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard dilution genes such as palomino or dun as well as graying and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses 44horses that have a white coat color are often mislabeled a horse that looks white is usually a middleaged or older gray grays are born a darker shade get lighter as they age but usually keep black skin underneath their white hair coat with the exception of pink skin under white markings  the only horses properly called white are born with a predominantly white hair coat and pink skin a fairly rare occurrence 46 different and unrelated genetic factors can produce white coat colors in horses including several different alleles of dominant white and the sabino1 gene 47 however there are no  albino  horses defined as having both pink skin and red eyes 48reproduction and development main article horse breeding gestation lasts approximately 340 days with an average range 320–370 days 49 and usually results in one foal twins are rare 50 horses are a precocial species and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth 51 foals are usually born in the spring the estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period 52 foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age 53horses particularly colts sometimes are physically capable of reproduction at about 18 months but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three especially females 54 horses four years old are considered mature although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six maturation also depends on the horses size breed sex and quality of care larger horses have larger bones therefore not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone these plates convert after the other parts of the bones and are crucial to development 55depending on maturity breed and work expected horses are usually put under saddle and trained to be ridden between the ages of two and four 56 although thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries 57 horses specifically bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed 58 for endurance riding competition horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60 calendar months five years old 12anatomy main articles equine anatomy muscular system of the horse respiratory system of the horse and circulatory system of the horse skeletal system main article skeletal system of the horse the skeletal system of a modern horse the horse skeleton averages 205 bones 59 a significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a collarbone —the horses forelimbs are attached to the spinal column by a powerful set of muscles tendons and ligaments that attach the shoulder blade to the torso the horses legs and hooves are also unique structures their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human for example the body part that is called a horses knee is actually made up of the carpal bones that correspond to the human wrist similarly the hock contains bones equivalent to those in the human ankle and heel the lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot and the fetlock incorrectly called the ankle is actually the proximal sesamoid bones between the cannon bones a single equivalent to the human metacarpal or metatarsal bones and the proximal phalanges located where one finds the knuckles of a human a horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks only skin hair bone tendons ligaments cartilage and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the hoof 60hooves main articles horse hoof horseshoe and farrier the critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage no foot no horse 61 the horse hoof begins with the distal phalanges the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe surrounded by cartilage and other specialized bloodrich soft tissues such as the laminae the exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of keratin the same material as a human fingernail 62 the end result is that a horse weighing on average 500 kilograms 1100 lb 63 travels on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe 64 for the protection of the hoof under certain conditions some horses have horseshoes placed on their feet by a professional farrier the hoof continually grows and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed and horseshoes reset if used every five to eight weeks 65 though the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain teeth main article horse teeth horses are adapted to grazing in an adult horse there are 12 incisors at the front of the mouth adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation there are 24 teeth adapted for chewing the premolars and molars at the back of the mouth stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors a type of canine teeth called tushes some horses both male and female will also develop one to four very small vestigial teeth in front of the molars known as wolf teeth which are generally removed because they can interfere with the bit there is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the gums or bars of the horses mouth when the horse is bridled 66an estimate of a horses age can be made from looking at its teeth the teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing therefore the incisors show changes as the horse ages they develop a distinct wear pattern changes in tooth shape and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet this allows a very rough estimate of a horses age although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear 7digestion main articles equine digestive system and equine nutrition horses are herbivores with a digestive system adapted to a forage diet of grasses and other plant material consumed steadily throughout the day therefore compared to humans they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients a 450kilogram 990 lb horse will eat 7 to 11 kilograms 15 to 24 lb of food per day and under normal use drink 38 to 45 litres 84 to 99 imp gal 10 to 12 us gal of water horses are not ruminants they have only one stomach like humans but unlike humans they can utilize cellulose a major component of grass horses are hindgut fermenters cellulose fermentation by symbiotic bacteria occurs in the cecum or water gut which food goes through before reaching the large intestine horses cannot vomit so digestion problems can quickly cause colic a leading cause of death 67senses a horses eye see also equine vision the horses senses are based on their status as prey animals where they must be aware of their surroundings at all times 68 they have the largest eyes of any land mammal 69 and are lateraleyed meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads 70 this means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350° with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision 69 horses have excellent day and night vision but they have twocolor or dichromatic vision their color vision is somewhat like redgreen color blindness in humans where certain colors especially red and related colors appear as a shade of green 71their sense of smell while much better than that of humans is not quite as good as that of a dog it is believed to play a key role in the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment horses have two olfactory centers the first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity which analyze a wide range of odors the second located under the nasal cavity are the vomeronasal organs also called jacobsons organs these have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones 72a horses hearing is good 68 and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180° giving the potential for 360° hearing without having to move the head 73 noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress a 2013 study in the uk indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting or if listening to country or classical music but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music this study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels 74 an australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had a higher rate of gastric ulcers than horses listening to music and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing 75horses have a great sense of balance due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed proprioception —the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times 76 a horses sense of touch is well developed the most sensitive areas are around the eyes ears and nose 77 horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body 78horses have an advanced sense of taste which allows them to sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat 79 and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains horses generally will not eat poisonous plants however there are exceptions horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food 80movement walk 58 kmh trot 813 kmh pace 813 kmh canter 1627 kmh galop 2530 kmh record 7076 kmh 4397 mph 81main articles horse gait trot horse gait canter and ambling all horses move naturally with four basic gaits the fourbeat walk which averages 64 kilometres per hour 40 mph the twobeat trot or jog at 13 to 19 kilometres per hour 81 to 118 mph faster for harness racing horses the canter or lope a threebeat gait that is 19 to 24 kilometres per hour 12 to 15 mph and the gallop 82 the gallop averages 40 to 48 kilometres per hour 25 to 30 mph 83 but the world record for a horse galloping over a short sprint distance is 7076 kilometres per hour 4397 mph 81 besides these basic gaits some horses perform a twobeat pace instead of the trot 84 there also are several fourbeat  ambling  gaits that are approximately the speed of a trot or pace though smoother to ride these include the lateral rack running walk and tölt as well as the diagonal fox trot 85 ambling gaits are often genetic in some breeds known collectively as gaited horses 86 often gaited horses replace the trot with one of the ambling gaits 87behavior main articles horse behavior and stable vices horses are prey animals with a strong fightorflight response their first reaction to threat is to startle and usually flee although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened 88 they also tend to be curious when startled they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright and may not always flee from something that they perceive as nonthreatening most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed agility alertness and endurance natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors however through selective breeding some breeds of horses are quite docile particularly certain draft horses 89horses are herd animals with a clear hierarchy of rank led by a dominant individual usually a mare they are also social creatures that are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals including humans they communicate in various ways including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying mutual grooming and body language many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated but with training horses can learn to accept a human as a companion and thus be comfortable away from other horses 90 however when confined with insufficient companionship exercise or stimulation individuals may develop stable vices an assortment of bad habits mostly stereotypies of psychological origin that include wood chewing wall kicking weaving rocking back and forth and other problems 91intelligence and learning studies have indicated that horses perform a number of cognitive tasks on a daily basis meeting mental challenges that include food procurement and identification of individuals within a social system they also have good spatial discrimination abilities 92 they are naturally curious and apt to investigate things they have not seen before 93 studies have assessed equine intelligence in areas such as problem solving speed of learning and memory horses excel at simple learning but also are able to use more advanced cognitive abilities that involve categorization and concept learning they can learn using habituation desensitization classical conditioning and operant conditioning and positive and negative reinforcement 92 one study has indicated that horses can differentiate between more or less if the quantity involved is less than four 94domesticated horses may face greater mental challenges than wild horses because they live in artificial environments that prevent instinctive behavior whilst also learning tasks that are not natural 92 horses are animals of habit that respond well to regimentation and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently one trainer believes that intelligent horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that best fits with an individual animals natural inclinations 95temperament main articles draft horse warmblood and oriental horse horses are mammals and as such are warmblooded or endothermic creatures as opposed to coldblooded or poikilothermic animals however these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology used to describe temperament not body temperature for example the hotbloods such as many race horses exhibit more sensitivity and energy 96 while the coldbloods such as most draft breeds are quieter and calmer 97 sometimes hotbloods are classified as light horses or riding horses 98 with the coldbloods classified as draft horses or work horses 99illustration of assorted breeds slim light hotbloods mediumsized warmbloods and draft and ponytype coldblood breedshot blooded breeds include  oriental horses  such as the akhalteke arabian horse barb and nowextinct turkoman horse as well as the thoroughbred a breed developed in england from the older oriental breeds 96 hot bloods tend to be spirited bold and learn quickly they are bred for agility and speed 100 they tend to be physically refined—thinskinned slim and longlegged 101 the original oriental breeds were brought to europe from the middle east and north africa when european breeders wished to infuse these traits into racing and light cavalry horses 102 103muscular heavy draft horses are known as cold bloods as they are bred not only for strength but also to have the calm patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people 97 they are sometimes nicknamed gentle giants 104 wellknown draft breeds include the belgian and the clydesdale 104 some like the percheron are lighter and livelier developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates 105 others such as the shire are slower and more powerful bred to plow fields with heavy claybased soils 106 the coldblooded group also includes some pony breeds 107 warmblood  breeds such as the trakehner or hanoverian developed when european carriage and war horses were crossed with arabians or thoroughbreds producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed 108 certain pony breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders 109 warmbloods are considered a light horse or riding horse 98today the term warmblood refers to a specific subset of sport horse breeds that are used for competition in dressage and show jumping 110 strictly speaking the term  warm blood  refers to any cross between coldblooded and hotblooded breeds 111 examples include breeds such as the irish draught or the cleveland bay the term was once used to refer to breeds of light riding horse other than thoroughbreds or arabians such as the morgan horse 100sleep patterns see also horse sleep patterns and sleep in nonhumans when horses lie down to sleep others in the herd remain standing awake or in a light doze keeping watch horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down in an adaptation from life in the wild horses are able to enter light sleep by using a  stay apparatus  in their legs allowing them to doze without collapsing 112 horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators a horse kept alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger 113unlike humans horses do not sleep in a solid unbroken period of time but take many short periods of rest horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest and from a few minutes to several hours lying down total sleep time in a 24hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours 113 mostly in short intervals of about 15 minutes each 114 the average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 29 hours per day 115horses must lie down to reach rem sleep they only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum rem sleep requirements 113 however if a horse is never allowed to lie down after several days it will become sleepdeprived and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into rem sleep while still standing 116 this condition differs from narcolepsy although horses may also suffer from that disorder 117taxonomy and evolution from left to right size development biometrical changes in the cranium reduction of toes left forefootmain articles evolution of the horse equus genus and equidae the horse adapted to survive in areas of wideopen terrain with sparse vegetation surviving in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals especially ruminants could not 118 horses and other equids are oddtoed ungulates of the order perissodactyla a group of mammals that was dominant during the tertiary period in the past this order contained 14 families but only three— equidae the horse and related species tapiridae the tapir  and rhinocerotidae the rhinoceroses —have survived to the present day 119the earliest known member of the family equidae was the hyracotherium which lived between 45 and 55 million years ago during the eocene period it had 4 toes on each front foot and 3 toes on each back foot 120 the extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the mesohippus which lived 32 to 37 million years ago 121 over time the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished all that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee 122 known informally as splint bones 123 their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed 122 by about 5 million years ago the modern equus had evolved 124 equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material then to grazing of tougher plains grasses thus protohorses changed from leafeating forestdwellers to grasseating inhabitants of semiarid regions worldwide including the steppes of eurasia and the great plains of north america by about 15000 years ago equus ferus was a widespread holarctic species horse bones from this time period the late pleistocene are found in europe eurasia beringia and north america 125 yet between 10000 and 7600 years ago the horse became extinct in north america and rare elsewhere 126 127 128 the reasons for this extinction are not fully known but one theory notes that extinction in north america paralleled human arrival 129 another theory points to climate change noting that approximately 12500 years ago the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra which was covered with unpalatable plants 130wild species surviving into modern times a small herd of przewalskis horses main article wild horse a truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever domesticated therefore most wild horses today are actually feral horses animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals 131 only two neverdomesticated subspecies the tarpan and the przewalskis horse survived into recorded history and only the latter survives today the przewalskis horse  equus ferus przewalskii  named after the russian explorer nikolai przhevalsky is a rare asian animal it is also known as the mongolian wild horse mongolian people know it as the taki and the kyrgyz people call it a kirtag the subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992 while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world in 1992 it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos 132 today a small wild breeding population exists in mongolia 133 134 there are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world the tarpan or european wild horse  equus ferus ferus was found in europe and much of asia it survived into the historical era but became extinct in 1909 when the last captive died in a russian zoo 135 thus the genetic line was lost attempts have been made to recreate the tarpan 135 136 137 which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses periodically populations of horses in isolated areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses but generally have been proven to be feral or domestic for example the riwoche horse of tibet was proposed as such 134 but testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses 138 similarly the sorraia of portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the tarpan based on shared characteristics 139 140 but genetic studies have shown that the sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness 139 141other modern equids main article equus genusbesides the horse there are seven other species of genus equus in the equidae family these are the ass or donkey equus asinus the mountain zebra equus zebra plains zebra equus quagga grévys zebra equus grevyi the kiang equus kiang and the onager equus hemionus 142horses can crossbreed with other members of their genus the most common hybrid is the mule a cross between a jack male donkey and a mare a related hybrid a hinny is a cross between a stallion and a jenny female donkey 143 other hybrids include the zorse a cross between a zebra and a horse 144 with rare exceptions most hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce 145domestication main articles history of horse domestication theories and domestication of the horse bhimbetka rock painting showing man riding on horse india domestication of the horse most likely took place in central asia prior to 3500 bc two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world the first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries the second source is a comparison of dna obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains the earliest archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in ukraine and kazakhstan dating to approximately 3500–4000 bc 146 147 148 by 3000 bc the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 bc there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern europe indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent 149 the most recent but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the sintashta and petrovka cultures c 2100 bc 150domestication is also studied by using the genetic material of presentday horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations the variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse 151 152 while many mares were part of early domesticated herds 141 153 154 this is reflected in the difference in genetic variation between the dna that is passed on along the paternal or sire line  ychromosome versus that passed on along the maternal or dam line  mitochondrial dna  there are very low levels of ychromosome variability 151 152 but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial dna 141 153 154 there is also regional variation in mitochondrial dna due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds 141 153 154 155 another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation 156 in horses this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 bc 157before the availability of dna techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse various hypotheses were proposed one classification was based on body types and conformation suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication 107 another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication 158 however the lack of a detectable substructure in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses feral populations main article feral horse feral horses are born and live in the wild but are descended from domesticated animals 131 many populations of feral horses exist throughout the world 159 160 studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses 161 as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions 162there are also semiferal horses in many parts of the world such as dartmoor and the new forest in the uk where the animals are all privately owned but live for significant amounts of time in wild conditions on undeveloped often public lands owners of such animals often pay a fee for grazing rights 163 164breeds main articles horse breed list of horse breeds and horse breeding the concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled written breed registry has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called thoroughbreds thoroughbred is a specific breed of horse while a purebred is a horse or any other animal with a defined pedigree recognized by a breed registry 165 horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring such as conformation color performance ability or disposition these inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods horses have been selectively bred since their domestication an early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the bedouin who had a reputation for careful practices keeping extensive pedigrees of their arabian horses and placing great value upon pure bloodlines 166 these pedigrees were originally transmitted via an oral tradition 167 in the 14th century carthusian monks of southern spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the andalusian horse 168breeds developed due to a need for form to function the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work 169 thus a powerful but refined breed such as the andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for dressage 169 heavy draft horses developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons 170 other horse breeds developed specifically for light agricultural work carriage and road work various sport disciplines or simply as pets 171 some breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds while others descended from a single foundation sire or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock one of the earliest formal registries was general stud book for thoroughbreds which began in 1791 and traced back to the foundation bloodstock for the breed 172 there are more than 300 horse breeds in the world today 173interaction with humans equine hospital in the united kingdom worldwide horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia horses are used for leisure activities sports and working purposes the food and agriculture organization fao estimates that in 2008 there were almost 59000000 horses in the world with around 33500000 in the americas 13800000 in asia and 6300000 in europe and smaller portions in africa and oceania there are estimated to be 9500000 horses in the united states alone 174 the american horse council estimates that horserelated activities have a direct impact on the economy of the united states of over 39 billion and when indirect spending is considered the impact is over 102 billion 175 in a 2004 poll conducted by animal planet more than 50000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the worlds 4th favorite animal 176communication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity 177 to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control 178 sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle 179 and occasionally horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear 180 many horses are also driven which requires a harness bridle and some type of vehicle 181sport a horse and rider in dressage competition at the olympics main articles equestrianism horse racing horse training and horse tack historically equestrians honed their skills through games and races equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle many sports such as dressage eventing and show jumping have origins in military training which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider other sports such as rodeo developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques 177 horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers all forms of competition requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport the popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat 177horses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions examples include show jumping dressage threeday eventing competitive driving endurance riding gymkhana rodeos and fox hunting 182 horse shows which have their origins in medieval european fairs are held around the world they host a huge range of classes covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines as well as inhand classes where the horses are led rather than ridden to be evaluated on their conformation the method of judging varies with the discipline but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider 183 sports such as polo do not judge the horse itself but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game although the horse requires specialized training to participate the details of its performance are not judged only the result of the riders actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task 184 examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other 185 and buzkashi a team game played throughout central asia the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback 184horse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry watched in almost every nation of the world there are three types flat racing steeplechasing ie racing over jumps and harness racing where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small light cart known as a sulky 186 a major part of horse racings economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it 187work a mounted police officer in poland there are certain jobs that horses do very well and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them for example mounted police horses are still effective for certain types of patrol duties and crowd control 188 cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote rugged terrain 189 search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people particularly hikers and children and to provide disaster relief assistance 190 horses can also be used in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil such as nature reserves they may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas horses are quieter than motorized vehicles law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective 191tanga carriage at darbhanga bihar although machinery has replaced horses in many parts of the world an estimated 100 million horses donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas this number includes around 27 million working animals in africa alone 192 some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses in agriculture less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses 193 194 logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging 195entertainment and culture the horseheaded deity in hinduism hayagriva see also horses in art and horse worship modern horses are often used to reenact many of their historical work purposes horses are used complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history especially recreations of famous battles 196 horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes countries such as the united kingdom still use horsedrawn carriages to convey royalty and other vips to and from certain culturally significant events 197 public exhibitions are another example such as the budweiser clydesdales seen in parades and other public settings a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon similar to that used before the invention of the modern motorized truck 198horses are frequently seen in television films and literature they are sometimes featured as a major character in films about particular animals but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories 199 both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products 200 the horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry in a variety of poses and equipment 201 the mythologies of many cultures including grecoroman hindu islamic and norse include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs and multiple

horses are grazing animals and their major source of nutrients is goodquality forage from hay or pasture 224 they can consume approximately 2 to 25 of their body weight in dry feed each day therefore a 450kilogram 990 lb adult horse could eat up to 11 kilograms 24 lb of food 225 sometimes concentrated feed such as grain is fed in addition to pasture or hay especially when the animal is very active 226 when grain is fed equine nutritionists recommend that 50 or more of the animals diet by weight should still be forage 227horses require a plentiful supply of clean water a minimum of 10 us gallons 38 l to 12 us gallons 45 l per day 228 although horses are adapted to live outside they require shelter from the wind and precipitation which can range from a simple shed or shelter to an elaborate stable 229horses require routine hoof care from a farrier as well as vaccinations to protect against various diseases and dental examinations from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist 230 if horses are kept inside in a barn they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental wellbeing 231 when turned outside they require wellmaintained sturdy fences to be safely contained 232 regular grooming is also helpful to help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin 233see also glossary of equestrian terms references linnaeus carolus 1758
