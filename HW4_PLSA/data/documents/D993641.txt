of petroleumbased thermoplastics made from the derivation of natural gas another common name for acrylic is polyacrylate which is one of the most common types this material is made from methyl methacrylate mma poly methyl methacrylate or a combination of both what’s with all the brand names although the composition is pretty much the same acrylic has many brand names plexiglas was the

evonik cyro llc some other common brands are perspex oroglass optix and altuglass injection molded acrylic vs handcrafted acrylic injection molded acrylic is manufactured by injecting acrylic or polymethyl methacrylate material into a mold this transparent thermoplastic makes a great alternative to glass which is why it is commonly used to manufacture bakery bins sunglasses and display risers unlike polystyrene injection molded acrylic can be made without the issues of hazing or coloration additionally the material is much stronger and has minimal relief markings when removed from the mold injection molding takes less labor than handcrafting which results in a lower cost acrylic bakery display case handcrafted acrylic is the most upscale plastic material we use when making our displays although handcrafting the polymer is more time consuming and therefore costs a little more the difference in quality is astounding there are virtually no defects as a result of manufacturing including common problems like relief marks or haze from molds unlike injection molding all joints are bonded by hand using solvent agents that actually melt the material together the result is a crystal clear construction that is extremely strong which is why our handcrafted acrylic display cases are so popular other types of plastic injection molded polystyrene is an aromatic polymer made from a chemically bonded monomer styrene polystyrene is usually thinner and more brittle than acrylic but often costs quite a bit less than other plastics because the material is made using a mold it can have relief markings as well as a blue haze effect when removed for this reason it is not the best product to preserve collectables and use for showcases many lowcost consumer goods are made from this injection molded polystyrene like disposable razor blades license plate frames singleuse dinnerware and cd cases polycarbonate sign holder polycarbonate is yet another type of thermoplastic polymer used in manufacturing this clear plastic is typically more expensive than acrylic and polystyrene but it is extremely strong many people associate polycarbonate with bulletproof glass because it is the same material used to make armored windows in government motorcade vehicles as well as airplane windows lexan is one of the most popular brand names associated with polycarbonate but a variety of
