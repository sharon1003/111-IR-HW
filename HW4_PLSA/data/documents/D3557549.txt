green algae brendan gow green algae make up the division chlorophyta which includes about 7500 species of eukayotic unicellular organisms some of the unifying characteristics of this division include similar photosynthetic pigments that make up the chloroplast which include chlorophylls a and b and a  b  and g carotenes and some xanthophylls and primary carotenoids bold 1985 almost all green algae store their carbohydrates in the form of starch for the most part their cell walls are composed of polysaccharides including cellulose the most obvious organelle of green algae is their chloroplast which is responsible for giving them their green color there is quite a bit of diversity in this division with regards to the number of flagella and habitat the numbers of flagella can vary from zero to dozens depending on the species the majority of the green algae species are found in freshwater but there are some species found on land terrestrial in salt water and some are even airborne all green algae have alteration of generations between diploid and haploid phases which is similar to plants the difference with regards to the alteration of generation in algae compared to plants has to do with the freeliving haploid and diploid phases at maturity in algae with plants these phases are usually attached at maturity whereas in the green algae they are freeliving clark 1998 green algae can also be diverse with regards to reproduction which can be either sexual or asexual different classes of green algae are unique in the ways in which they organize themselves their vegetative organization can be unicellular colonial or filamentous with regards to movement green algae can be either motile or nonmotile green algae are considered by most botanists to be the closest relatives to plants some of the characteristics that green algae have in common with plants are chlorophyll a and b starch for energy storage and cellulose in their cell walls the class of green algae that is the most closely related to plants is charophycean green algae there is a bit of a debate as to what order of this family is the most closely related either chara or coleochaete depending on whether a botanist thinks that flavonoid biosynthesis or zygote retention by the gametophytes respectively occurred twice in evolution clark 1998 the diversity of this division continues to be seen with regards to their life cycles there are three major life cycle categories sporic meiosis gametic meiosis and zygotic meiosis most common sporic meiosis is the life cycle that most resembles plants in sporic meiosis a multicellular diploid phase undergoes meiosis to make haploid spores these spores which are either motile zoospores or nonmotile aplanospores grow by mitosis and cytokinesis into the haploid phase of their life cycle clark 1998 the spores produce haploid parents which then produce gametes motile or nonmotile which join during fertilization reproducing the original diploid phase the second major type of life cycle gametic meiosis resembles the life cycle of animals in this life cycle the multicellular diploid phase undergoes meiosis and produces gametes directly not spores zygotic meiosis the third type of life cycle resembles the life cycle of fungi in this case haploid parents produce gametes which then fuse to form a diploid zygote the only diploid part of this life cycle this zygote then undergoes meiosis producing haploid cells and zoospores which then germinate and produce haploid offspring clark p641 as mentioned earlier there are three ways that green algae organize themselves the first is unicellular organization unicellular green algae can be either motile or nonmotile motile green algae usually reproduce asexually by mitosis and cell division yet under stressful environmental conditions some motile green algae such as chlamydomonas reproduce sexually by gathering into a cluster resulting in threads fusing the cytoplasm of adjacent cells and ultimately the nuclei fuse together and fertilization occurs resulting in a diploid nucleus this diploid zygote is able to remain dormant until conditions become better then it divides by meiosis and releases four haploid zoospores unicellular nonmotile green algae usually produce zoospores clark 1998 the second type of organization is colonial in this organization the cells join together in colonies by attaching to one another with cytoplasmic threads these colonies move by coordinating their flagella which allows the colony to roll like a ball colonial green algae can also reproduce either sexually or asexually clark 1998 the third and final type of organization is filamentous green algae organized in this way are usually very small microscopic they can be branched or unbranced and madeup of cells with one nucleus or multiple nuclei this organization can again reproduce through either sexual usually zygotic or sporic meiosis or asexual reproduction clark 1998some types of green algae can have very positive affects on both soil and water an experiment done by the u s department of agriculture’s usda’s agricultural research service ars surveyed 7320 acre’s around three lakes beasley deep hollow and thighman in mississippi the goal of this project was to improve farming techniques and enhance water and soil quality what they discovered was that management practices influence the green algae populations which impact the water quality it was found that the deep hollow watershed had the best water quality and the highest algae concentration the area around the deep hollow watershed is known for its conservative practices such as reduced tillage and winter cover crops these conservative practices are what allowed selenastrum and ankistrodesmus families of green alga to flourish in this area it was the high concentrations of these algae that were responsible for the high water quality these green alga absorb and breakdown herbicides such as atrazine and fluometuron both of which are used in corn and cotton products anonymous 1999 in conclusion the division chlorophyta is extremely diverse with regards to life cycles vegetative organization reproduction habitat and movement this diversity is what makes green algae the biggest algae division madeup of some 7500 species the unifying characteristics of this division are chloroplast
