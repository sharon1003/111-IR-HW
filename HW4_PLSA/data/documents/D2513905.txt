plant development embryogenesis plant development meristems plant development plant and animal development have in common fertilization of a 1n haploid egg cell by a 1n sperm nucleus cell division and growth help create the shape of the embryo molecular mechanisms of determination generate different cell types plant development differs from animal development plant cells do not migrate as do bacteria or animal cells  plant shape forms based on the rate of cell division and the direction of elongation  although plants develop three basic tissue systems dermal ground and vascular they dont rely on gastrulation to establish this layered system of tissues plant development is continuous new plant organs are formed throughout their life by clusters of embryonic cells called meristem plants have tremendous developmental plasticity lost plant parts can be regenerated by meristems and even entire plants can be regenerated from single cells in addition environmental factors such as light and temperature can greatly influence overall plant form the flowering plant angiosperm life cycle is shown below and the fertilization process is shown in more detail after thatfrom susan singer the egg cell and polar nuclei are contained within the embryo sac th e sperm nuclei are derived from the pollen grainsfrom the online biology book double fertilization one sperm nucleus fertilizes the egg generating a 2n diploid zygote another sperm nucleus fertilizes a polar cell with two 1n nuclei generating a 3n triploid endosperm which provides nutrients to the developing embryofrom the online biology book embryogenesis plant embryogenesis begins with an asymmetric cell division resulting in a smaller apical terminal cell and a larger basal cell this first asymmetric division provides polarity to the embryo most of the plant embryo develops from the apical terminal cell the suspensor develops from the basal cell the suspensor anchors the embryo to the endosperm and serves as a nutrient conduit for the developing embryo further cell division leads to the globular stage the three basic tissue systems dermal ground and vascular can be recognized at this point based on characteristic cell division patterns the globular shape of the embryo is then lost as the cotyledons embryonic leaves begin to form the formation of two cotyledons in dicots gives the embryo a heart shaped appearance in monocots only a single cotyledon forms upright cotyledons can give the embryo a torpedo shape and by this point the suspensor is degenerating and the shoot apical meristem and room apical meristem are established these meristems will give rise to the adult structures of the plant upon germination further growth of the cotyledons results in the torpedo and walkingstick stages at this point embryogenesis is arrested and the mature seed dessicates and remains dormant until germinationfrom susan singer in the following images the descendants of the apical cell are shown in yellow and the descendants of the basal cell are shown in pinkfrom chunming liu a large amount information on cell division patterns and organogenesis during embryo development has been accumulated based on descriptive studies however in order to reveal the mechanisms underlying the pattern formation during plant embryogenesis one needs to experimentally perturb this process two approaches experimental embryology and genetic dissection have been used for this purpose because plant embryos are not easily accessible they are developing within the ovule of the maternal parent experimental embryology has relied on somatic embryogenesis  formation of embryos from adult cells in tissue culture  however this approach is problematic since a high proportion of abnormal embryos occur quite often in tissue culture in the past decade many scientists have been attempting to genetically dissect the mechanisms underlying plant embryo pattern formation this approach relies on the isolation and characterization of mutants which are defective in this process primarily using the model plant arabidopsis thalianafrom detlef weigel m utants have been identified that result in changes in the establishment of the apicalbasal pattern organization of organs along the apicalbasal axis and the radial pattern organization of the three basic tissue systems  dermal ground and vascular from chunming liu arabidopsis mutant seedlings were identified that showed a loss or distortion of the root hypocotyl or cotyledon regions these defects are presumed to result from defects during embryogenesis these mutants were then placed into the following major classesmutants lacking body segments along the apicalbasal axis this class includes gurke gk fackel fk monopterous mp and gnom gnmutants with disturbed radial symmetry  alterations of the radial pattern of tissue layers this class includes knolle kn and keule keumutants with disrupted organogenesis  these mutants have grossly abnormal overall shapes but have all of the pattern elements along the apicalbasal and radial axes this class includes fass fs knopf knf and mickey mic images of these mutants are shown below with a wild type wt arabidopsis seedling for comparisonfrom jim haseloff arabidopsis mutants with defects in the apicalbasal pattern can be further classified based on the part of the seedling that is missing analagous to the gap mutants of drosophilafrom jim haseloff meristems the adult body of vascular plants is the result of meristematic activity plant meristems are centers of mitotic cell division and are composed of a group of undifferentiated selfrenewing stem cells from which most plant structures arise apical meristems are located at the growing tips of the adult plant and produce root and shoot tissue shoot apical meristems sam initiate leaves during vegetative development and inflorescence im and floral meristems fm during reproductive development this is a longitudianal section through a shoot apex compare this image to the diagram below image from ross koningimage from ross koning this is a longitudianal section through a root tip compare this image to the diagram belowimage from ross koningimage from ross koning how are shoot meristems organized there are approximately 100 cells in the sam of arabidopsis thaliana these cells are organized in two ways cells are organized in radial zones and also in layers radial organization cells that are at the very top of the meristem divide infrequently this region is called the central zone this is the location of the selfrenewing undifferentiated stem cells surrounding the central zone is the peripheral zone the rate of cell division in the peripheral zone is higher than that of the central zone peripheral zone cells give rise to cells which contribute to the organs of the plant including leaves inflorescence meristems and floral meristems below the central zone is another region of rapidly dividing cells called the rib meristem division and elongation of rib meristem cells gives rise to the stem of the plant layer organization the surface layer s of cells l1 divides only by forming anticlinal cell walls  that is cell division is always perpendicular to the meristem surface as a results cells in the l1 layer and their daughter cells always remain in this layer  all of the cells in the l1 layer are clonally related the l2 cell layer s below the l1 cells behave in just the same way the remaining cells l3 or corpus cells divide in all planes and fill the interior of the meristem the figure below shows an inforescence shoot apical meristem sam and two adjacent floral meristems fm of arabidopsis thaliana on the left is the original laser scanning confocal microscope optical section of tissue stained with propidium iodide to show the nuclei the center image was colored to show radial zonation within the sam the central zone cz is shown in red the peripheral zone pz in green and the rib meristem rm in blue the image on the right was colored to show clonallyrelated layers the epidermal l1 layer is shown in blue  the subepidermal l2 layer is shown in pink and the l3 layer or corpus is shown in gold the l1 and l2 together are called the tunicafrom elliot meyerowitz throughout the plants life the meristem retains its size and shape despite cell division and cell differentiation what regulates the balance between cell differentiation and cell division if cell differentiation were restricted then the meristem would increase in size in contrast if cell division were restricted then the meristem would decrease in size arabidopsis mutants that display altered shoot apical meristem structure have been identified shoot meristemless  stm  mutants are shoot meristemless  mutations in the stm gene completely block the initiation of the sam during embryogenesis but have no other obvious effects on embryo development the image below shows a wild type seedling on the left and an stm mutant seedling on the right notice the lack of a sam between the cotyledons of the stm mutantimage from kathy barton wuschel mutants have a flat sam one result of this mutation is the formation of flowers with fewer organs the wuschel mutant flower on the right has only one stamen and no central pistil the wild type flower on the left has 6 stamens and a central pistilimage on left from elliot meyerowitzimage on right from thomas laux in contrast to shoot meristemless and wuschel mutants clavata mutants have a much bigger shoot meristems than wild type plants due to an overproliferation of cells in the sam shown below are optical sections through the sam of mature embryos stained with propidium iodide to show the nuclei the clavata1  clv14 mutant embryo on the right has a larger sam with more cells than that of the wild type leftimages from elliot meyerowitz one result of clavata mutations is the formation of extra floral organs from floral meristems on the left
