 cosmas the indian voyagera greek traveller and geographer of the first half of the sixth century b at alexandria egypt cosmas probably received only an elementary education as he was intended for a mercantile life and in his earlier years was engaged in business pursuits it may be however that by further study he increased his knowledge since his notes and observations show more than ordinary training his business took him to the regions lying south of egypt the farthest point of his travels in this direction being cape guardafui he traversed the mediterranean the red sea and the persian gulf and gathered information about lands lying far to the east but it is not certain that he actually visited india in his later years he entered the monastery of raithu on the peninsula of sinai if it be necessary to suppose as some investigators assert that cosmas was at any time a nestorian it would appear from his work the christian topography that at least towards the close of his life he returned to the orthodox faith while an inmate of the monastery he wrote the topography above mentioned a work which gives him a position of importance among the geographers of the early middle ages the christian topography has been preserved in two manuscript copies one in the laurentian library at florence and the other in the vatican in the second half of the seventeenth century isaac vossius emeric bigot and melchisédech thévenot first made the work known in a fragmentary way by publishing extracts from it the first complete and critical edition accompanied by a latin translation was issued by bernard de montfaucon in his collectio nova patrum et scriptorum græcorum paris 1707 ii 113345 the topography was also printed by galandi in his bibliotheca veterum patrum venice 1776 and in migne p g paris 1864 lxxxviii 51476 a french translation of the most important parts is found in charton voyageurs anciens et modernes paris 1855 a complete english translation with notes and a critical introduction was issued for the hakluyt society by j w mc crindle london 1897 the work is divided into twelve books and contains a description of the universe as cosmas constructed it in his imagination and an account of those regions which he had visited or concerning which he had gathered information according to cosmas the world is a rectangular structure in two sections their length much greater than their breadth and corresponding in form and proportions to the tabernacle of the old testament  the base is formed by the surface of the earth around which flows the ocean on the other side of the ocean lies another — unknown — continent from which rise the walls that support the firmament above the stars are carried by the angels in a circle around the firmament above the firmament springs a vault which separates the heaven of the blessed from the world beneath the theory that there is an antipodes says cosmas is a doctrine to be rejected the earth rises towards the north and ends in a coneshaped mountain behind which the sun continues its wanderings during the night and the nights are long or short according as the position of the sun is near the base or the summit of the mountain this curious attempt to harmonize a childish biblical exegesis with ordinary phenomena and the current opinions of the time is at least superior to the extraordinary geographical hypotheses of that day aside from the fact that the theories of cosmas exercised no influence they are not of sufficient importance to affect the genuine worth of several portions of the topography the value of these passages rests on the methodical conscientiousness of the simple merchant as it is seen for example in the careful copy of the socalled inscription of adulis  monumentum adulitanum  which has been preserved to greek epigraphy only in the copy of cosmas cosmas with the aid of his travelling companion menas took a copy of it in 522 for the governor of the christian king elesbaan of abyssinia retaining a replica for himself of equal importance is the information he collected concerning zanzibar and the indian ocean and what he learned as to the trade of abyssinia with the interior of africa and of egypt with the east the bestknown and most celebrated part of the topography is the description in the ninth book of ceylon and of the plants and animals of india the work also gives much valuable information concerning the extension of christianity in his day the vatican manuscript of the christian topography has explanatory maps and sketches either made by cosmas himself or prepared under his direction they are of value as the first efforts of patristic geography four other writings of cosmas are unfortunately lost a cosmography an astronomical treatise and
