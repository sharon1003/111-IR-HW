costvolumeprofit cvp analysis focuses on the relationships of prices costs volume and mix of products it is useful for determining the number of units or total sales revenue that the company must generate to breakeven or to achieve a desired level of profit the profit equation in its the most basic form profit is calculated as revenue minus expenses cvp analysis is based on the profit equation which consists of the same components with expenses segregated by behaviorvariable versus fixed recall from a previous chapter that the total cost equation also separates costs based on behavior and is expressed as total cost  vcx  tfcthe profit equation uses the income statement components in a horizontal format the two components of the cost equation are plugged into the profit equation to replace both expenses resulting in the following profit equation sales revenue  variable costs  fixed costs  profit spx – vcx – tfc  profit where sp  sales price per unit vc  variable cost per unit tfc  total fixed costsx  number of units the first component of the profit equation is spx it is based on the financial accounting concept of sales revenue in which the selling price per unit times the number of units sold generates total sales revenue the second component is vcx which is the variable cost per unit vc times the number of units sold x generating total variable costs the last component is total fixed costs which is the same in total regardless of the number of units sold the key to remember is that the first two components of the profit equationselling price and variable costsare amounts per unit and the final component fixed costs is a total and not dependent on the number of units in managerial accounting we often use the term costs interchangeably with expenses and we often use net operating income instead of profit the format of the profit equation includes the components of the variable costing income statement while the variable costing income statement displays its components in a vertical format the profit equation is displayed in a horizontal format although some textbooks provide specific formulas to calculate breakeven amounts and target profit amounts the formulas are not very flexible and require memorization the profit equation approach is easier to remember given that you already know the format of the variable costing income statement assumptions in cvp analysis when relying on cvp analysis you must remember four assumptions that enhance your understanding of the limitations of the analysis the assumptions are costs behave is a linear format costs can be accurately separated into their variable and fixed components both unit variable costs and total fixed costs remain constant within the relevant range the number of units sold equals the number of units produced ie there is no change in inventory levels during the period breakeven point the breakeven point is the point where sales revenue equals total costs resulting in zero profit to use the profit equation to calculate a breakeven point replace the profit side of the equation with zero spx – vcx – fc  0breakeven point in units by inserting the appropriate sales price per unit variable cost per unit and total fixed cost information into the profit equation you can solve for xthe breakeven point in units for example assume tara dyne inc has a single product with a unit variable cost of 4 a unit selling price of 10 and total fixed costs of 15600 to determine the breakeven point plug the amounts given into the profit equation as follows10x  4x  15600  0x  2600 units solving for x you determine the number of units that tara dyne must sell to breakeven to be 2600 units breakeven point in sales dollars to determine the sales revenue at the breakeven point multiple the two components of total sales revenuethe number of units to be sold at breakeven times the selling price per unit for tara dyne sales revenue at breakeven will be2600 x 10  26000checking your work it is a good idea to always check your work as this serves as a double check that your math calculations are correct there are two ways to check your work you can plug your breakeven point back into the equation and solve to be sure it is correct plugging 2600 units for x in the profit equation 10 2600  4 2600  15600  0the math proves the equation is in balance another way to check your work is to construct a variable costing income statement using the components of the profit equation sales revenue equals 10 times 2600 units variable costs are 4 per unit times 2600 units and total fixed costs remain at 15600 profit is zero at the breakeven point sales revenue26000variable costs 10400fixed costs 15600profit net operating income  0target profit because most companies have aspirations of earning more profit than zero the profit equation quickly adapts to determine the units or sales dollars needed to achieve a target profit target profit is the profit level management desires to earn during a specified period and can be expressed in units or sales dollars for purposes of this chapter we will ignore income taxes and specify target profit as income before taxes units to achieve a target profit to calculate the number of units to be sold in order to earn a specified target profit replace the right side of the profit equation with the desired profit level spx  vcx  tfc  profit assume again that tara dyne sells its only product for 10 unit selling price each unit carries a variable cost of 4 and total fixed costs are 15600 instead of expecting to breakeven assume tara dyne wants to earn 12000 of profit we use the same profit equation components but substitute the desired profit level of 12000 on the right side of the equation10x ‒ 4x ‒ 15600  12000x  4600 units solving for x we determine that the company must sell 4600 units to earn a profit before taxes of 12000 sales revenue to achieve a target profit to determine the sales revenue necessary to achieve a target profit begin with the units needed to achieve a target profit and multiply by the unit selling price at the 10 selling price per unit when 4600 units are sold tara dynes total sales revenue will be 46000 at the point at which the company generates target profit of 120004600 x 10  46000margin of safety managers are usually pleased when their profit levels are high however when operations are not as desired managers want to keep a close watch on operations during the accounting period theoretically it is not economically feasible to track the level of profit during the accounting period due to accrual basis accounting the amount of profit is not determined until after the accounting period at which time it is often too late to make changes in operations the margin of safety can give managers an efficient method of tracking operations and will help them control operations during the period to possibly avoid a loss the margin of safety is a calculation that indicates how much sales can drop before a loss will occur it can be calculated in number of units or in sales dollars the latter of which is more useful when a company sells multiple products margin of safety is calculated as the difference between expected sales and the breakeven be point margin of safety in sales dollars  expected sales revenue  be sales revenue margin of safety in units  expected sales in units  be sales in units assume that tara dyne sells its only product for 10 each has a unit variable cost of 4 total monthly fixed costs of 15600 and is selling an average of 2850 units each month the breakeven point in units previously calculated was 2600 units the margin of safety in units for tara dyne is margin of safety in units  2850  2600  250 units sales in units can drop by 250 units before the company is in trouble ie before it incurs a loss the margin of safety in sales dollars is margin of safety in sales dollars  2850 x 10  2600 x 10  2500sales revenue can drop by 2500 before the company incurs a loss this information is helpful for managers as they are able to manage operations by tracking daily sales through a cash register or sales invoices much more effectively than tracking profit that is affected by a number of expenses accruals and deferrals for which information is not readily available during the period using contribution margin per unit in cvp analysis suppose you need to calculate the breakeven point but know neither the unit selling price nor unit variable cost you can use the contribution margin per unit in the profit equation to calculate the breakeven point by subtracting the first two components of the profit equation from each other ie sp  vc their net difference is the contribution margin per unit assume tara dyne sells one product which results in a unit contribution margin of 6 and it incurs total fixed costs of 15600 the x is first factored out of the first two components of the profit equation spx  vcx  tfc  profit sp  vcx  tfc  profit the coefficients in the parentheses sp and vc are then netted together resulting in the contribution margin per unit cmu reducing the equation to the following condensed unit form of the profit equation cmux  tfc  profit cmux  tfc  profit you can use the condensed unit form of the profit equation to calculate the unit breakeven point or to calculate sales in units needed to achieve a target profit the only difference when used to determine sales at a target profit level is the right side of the profit equation contains the desired profit rather than zero using the contribution margin ratio to calculate in cvpin the absence of the unit selling price the unit variable cost or the unit contribution margin you can use the contribution margin ratio to calculate sales needed to breakeven or to obtain a target profit similar to the method used to convert the profit equation to its unit form you can substitute the contribution margin ratio to replace the sp  vc components of the profit equation to solve for breakeven or target profit sales revenue spx  vcx  tfc  profit cmrx  tfc  profit because the cmr is based on sales revenue using it in the profit equation allows you to calculate the breakeven sales revenue or revenue needed to earn a target profit effect on profit of selling one more unit or one more dollar of revenue one more unit the unit contribution margin is the amount each unit contributes to cover fixed costs and contribute to profit beyond the breakeven point every additional unit sold increases profit by the amount of the unit contribution margin effect on profit of additional units  contribution margin per unit x additional units lets assume a vendor at nfl football game sells draft beer for 8 each the vendors cost is 120 per beer and its fixed costs total 800 for the duration of each football game each additional beer the vendor sells will generate an additional 680 of profit 800  120 the amount of the contribution margin in other words each beer sold contributes 680 towards covering fixed costs and then contribute to profit one more dollar of sales revenue the contribution margin ratio is the amount from each sales dollar that contributes to covering fixed costs and contribute to profit beyond the breakeven point every additional dollar of sales increases profit by the amount of the contribution margin ratio times the incremental dollar of sales effect on profit of additional revenue  contribution margin ratio x additional revenue the nfl football game vendor has a contribution margin ratio of 680 divided by 800 or 8500 each additional dollar of sales will generate an additional 85 cents to cover fixed costs and then contribute to profit whatif analysis the profit equation lends itself well to whatif analysis it is easy to replace components of the profit equation based on what if changes to selling price fixed costs variable costs or desired profit level assume the same nfl vendor sells draft beer for 8 each his unit cost is 120 and its fixed costs total 800 for the duration of each football game suppose the beer vendor wants to know what will happen to the breakeven point if he changes to bottled beer that requires less labor because beer can be served without pouring into cups reducing labor costs by 15 however the bottled beer will require a new cooling cart to chill the beer causing fixed costs to increase by 80 per football game for the cart rental the vendor wants to know if he should make the proposed change first calculate the breakeven point without the changes800 x  120 x  800  0x  11764 beers to breakeven because only full beers are sold we must round up to 118 rounding down even if less than 05 causes a loss to result remember that managers become very disappointed with lossesnow modify the profit equation to reflect the variable and fixed cost changes800 x  120  1  015 x  800  80  0x  12607 beers to breakeven because a partial beer cannot be sold you must round up to 127 beers the vendor must now sell 127 beers to breakeven rather than 118 or 9 additional beers selling more units is more work for the vendor so you should recommend that the proposed change should not be made walk through problem frame up produces 8 by 10 photo frames selected cost and sales information follows sales revenue per unit 1200variable costs per

total fixed costs are125 x 7280  9100by definition fixed costs in total are the same regardless of the level of activity as such 9100 is the expected fixed cost amount each month set up the cost equation as tc  680x  9100b breakeven sales in units the profit equation is used to determine the breakeven point1200x  680x  9100  0x  1750 units always verify that the number of units to be sold is feasible if the amount is not a whole number it must be rounded up as a partial unit cannot be sold c breakeven sales revenue frame up sells each unit for 1200 the number of units at breakeven is multiplied by the selling price per unit to arrive at 21000 total sales revenue at breakeven1200 x 1750 units  21000d profit from additional units sold the contribution margin per unit indicates the

additional profit  433333 x 1800  780f whatif scenario substitute the adjusted cost changes in the profit equation since total fixed costs are expected to decline by 15 the new fixed costs will be 100  15 times the original fixed costs the new variable cost per unit will be 680 plus 075 or 755 per unit the new profit equation is1200x  680  075x   100  15 x 9100  0x  173820 units  1739 units once again you must round up the number of units to avoid a loss comparing the new breakeven point of 1739 units with the original breakeven units of 1750 you can recommend that management should make the changes it is easier to sell 1739 units than to sell 1750 in addition for each of the 11 fewer units to be sold 1750  1739 the company will generate additional profit of 445 each this page was last
