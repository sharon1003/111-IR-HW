before casting casting iron in a sand mold judenplatz holocaust memorial nameless library by rachel whiteread concrete cast of books on library shelves turned inside out casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape and then allowed to solidify the solidified part is also known as a casting which is ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process casting materials are usually metals or various cold setting materials that cure after mixing two or more components together examples are epoxy concrete plaster and clay casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods 1casting is a 6000yearold process the oldest surviving casting is a copper frog from 3200 bc 2contents  hide 1 types11 metal12 plaster concrete or plastic resin2 fettling3 casting process simulation4 see also5 references6 further reading types  editmetal  editmain article casting metalworkingin metalworking metal is heated until it becomes liquid and is then poured into a mold the mold is a hollow cavity that includes the desired shape but the mold also includes runners and risers that enable the metal to fill the mold the mold and the metal are then cooled until the metal solidifies the solidified part the casting is then recovered from the mold subsequent operations remove excess material caused by the casting process such as the runners and risers plaster concrete or plastic resin  editmain article resin casting plaster and other chemical curing materials such as concrete and plastic resin may be cast using singleuse waste molds as noted above multipleuse piece molds or molds made of small rigid pieces or of flexible material such as latex rubber which is in turn supported by an exterior mold when casting plaster or concrete the material surface is flat and lacks transparency often topical treatments are applied to the surface for example painting and etching can be used in a way that give the appearance of metal or stone alternatively the material is altered in its initial casting process and may contain colored sand so as to give an appearance of stone by casting concrete rather than plaster it is possible to create sculptures fountains or seating for outdoor use a simulation of highquality marble may be made using certain chemicallyset plastic resins for example epoxy or polyester which are thermosetting polymers with powdered stone added for coloration often with multiple colors worked in the latter is a common means of making washstands washstand tops and shower stalls with the skilled working of multiple colors resulting in simulated staining patterns as is often found in natural marble or travertine fettling  editraw castings often contain irregularities caused by seams and imperfections in the molds 3 as well as access ports for pouring material into the molds 4 the process of cutting grinding shaving or sanding away these unwanted bits is called fettling 5 6 in modern times robotic processes have been developed to perform some of the more repetitive parts of the fettling process 7 but historically fettlers carried out this arduous work manually 8 and often in conditions dangerous to their health 9fettling can add significantly to the cost of the resulting product and designers of molds seek to minimize it through the shape of the mold the material being cast and sometimes by including decorative elements 10 3casting process simulation  editcasting process simulation uses numerical methods to calculate cast component quality considering mold filling solidification and cooling and provides a quantitative prediction of casting mechanical properties thermal stresses and distortion simulation accurately describes a cast component’s quality upfront before production starts the casting rigging can be designed with respect to the required component properties this has benefits beyond a reduction in preproduction sampling as the precise layout of the complete casting system also leads to energy material and tooling savings the software supports the user in component design the determination of melting practice and casting methoding through to pattern and mold making heat treatment and finishing this saves costs along the entire casting manufacturing route casting process simulation was initially developed at universities starting from the early 70s mainly in europe and in the u s and is regarded as the most important innovation in casting technology over the last 50 years since the late 80s commercial programs such as auto cast and magma are available which make it possible for foundries to gain new insight into what is happening inside the mold or die during the casting process see also  editengineering portal centrifugal casting industrialcore plug die casting glass casting investment casting lostfoam
