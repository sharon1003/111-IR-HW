home — water powered sump pumps — the cost of operating a water powered sump pump the cost of operating a water powered sump pump tweet pin it how much does it cost to run a basepump water powered backup sump pump let’s take a look…in a home with 90 psi water pressure basepump models use 1 gallon of city water to remove 2 gallons of sump pit water the most efficient water use of any water powered pump on the market because basepump is a backup pump that only activates during emergencies the total water usage over the long run is minimal to give a sense for the potential cost of running the pump during a heavy storm here is an extreme example if you own the highest volume basepump model the cb1500 or cb1500avb and during a very heavy storm the basepump ran every 5 minutes in 30 second cycles for an entire 24hour day that makes for 288 cycles each of those 30 second cycles could have used up to 75 gallons of city water according to the epa the u s national average cost of water is 0002 per gallon so multiplying 288 cycles by 75 gallons per cycle by a water cost of 0002 per gallon your cost to operate the pump would only be 432 during that 24 hour period keep in mind this is an extreme example in many cases your pump would run much less and your operational cost would be even lower also if you have a lower capacity basepump model than the pump we used in the example the largest basepump your cost would be significantly lower in general your water powered sump pump’s operational cost is likely to be similar in magnitude to the electrical cost for running your primary sump pump both costs pale in comparison to the expense of repairing even a tiny amount of water damage in your basement let alone the cost of redoing a finished basement ruined by a complete basement flood this article is intended for informational purposes before beginning any construction project at your home please ensure that you take necessary safety precautions and consult construction professionals whenever necessary
