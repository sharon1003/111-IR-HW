login to contact from jamaica 452007 1055 esthello goya i am jamaican who has lived in north american for a few years and the cost of maintain the same lifestyle here in jamaica to when you are in the u s or canada can be higher in order to keep our living costs down while not reducing the standard of living we have had to do a number of things 1 buy local food and produce imported items will send your grocery biil through the roof 2 look for rental outside of the prime areas but close enough to kgn it also helps if you can find someone you can trust to help you look 3 good quality schools come at a high cost thats an additional expense u may not be able to avoid we have decided to home school our 4 year old 4 transportation is something else to look at the public transportation system is not good so having a vehicle is a necessity these are the things that comes to my mind readily however if you have any further questions or concerns i would be glad to help post a reply0 0

for a new 2bedroom apartment is 900us a month and the apartment comes with dishwasher stove fridge microvave ac all the standard stuff like the us apt would have and it about 1200 sq ft its pretty roomy food is inexpensive if you cut out all the imported items motor vehicle is expensive because of the duty on it housekeeper is less than a 100us a week private school can range in price from
