lose a second or third–there are so many wonderful tooth fairy traditions you can create besides the old toothforcash swap some are old some new some crafty some high tech so on behalf of our sponsor wishingtooth the first app that brings the lost legend of the tooth fairy to life we’ve put together some of our favorite ways to celebrate a lost tooth and create more magic for a child around that very big kid milestone1 write a note to the tooth fairy this is the most adorable free printable tooth fairy note at top from handmade charlotte it’s easy to make and so empowering for kids to be able to jot their own short note welcoming the tooth fairy–or maybe even thanking her the morning after there’s even a printable that she can use to write back but of course any stationery at all will do2 introduce kids to the real tooth fairy zora swift yes she is real and she has a name zora swift cute right the new wishingtooth storybook adventure app i os android kindle is a magical introduction to the lost legend of the real tooth fairy bringing it life in an interactive multimedia magical adventure about empowering kids to believe in their dreams you can check out the wishingtooth storybook online for a great sense of the experience or visit cool mom tech for more details bonus the download is totally free for a limited time3 have your child interact with the real tooth fairy over twitter a clever idea in a social media world this friday february 28 is national tooth fairy day for real which also happens to be zora swift’s birthday you can tweet your child’s wishes and questions to zora swift starting now and she’ll respond during the wishingtooth twitter party at 6pm et on friday plus there will be digital giveaways how cool would it be to see your child’s face as he gets a real response from her but even after the twitter party is over keep zora swift in mind so that your child can tweet her any time through your account of course she’d probably love to see a photo of a smiling child with that first missing tooth she’s already collected4 make your own tooth fairy box since children are so excited already about losing a tooth keep this tooth fairy keepsake box craft kit on hand when that first tooth gets wiggly and put your kid’s energy and creativity to work stash the final result on the dresser or night table which is of course way easier for the actual tooth fairy to access in the middle of the night you can also use a plain wooden treasure box found at a craft store and let kids decorate to their hearts’ content6 give a small gift instead of money a lot of parents like to celebrate a first lost tooth with little toys or gifts instead of money as their own tooth fairy traditions maybe a lego minifig or temporary tattoos another option for that special first tooth is this personalized wooden tooth fairy box from etsy’s urban timber woodworks it’s the gift that keeps on giving since kids can use it for the rest of those baby teeth that will be coming out7 sprinkle fairy dust under the pillow or leading up to the door if you can handle the glitter cleanup some parents like to sprinkle just a wee bit of glitter around the money or gift that’s left under your child’s pillow as proof that she’s been there to visit magical another option is to spray glitter on a coin or bill itself we’ve even heard about trails of glitter leading up to a child’s bedroom door with teeny footprints in them–just about the size of a barbie shoe coincidentally just be sure you don’t have walltowall carpeting for that one8 pick out a tooth fairy pillow if you’ve ever tried to sneak a few coins or cash under the pillow of a sleeping child without waking him up you know it can be downright terrifying that’s why we’ve always have loved all sorts of tooth fairy pillows like this one from sparkle power on etsy which is handmade from vintage fabrics in fun colors for boys or girls leave it at the foot of the bed or on a nearby chair another option are these tiny tooth fairy house pillows from new mom designs a little pouch on the back holds a bill or a few coins but we love that our kids would play with them all the time what a nice way to welcome zora to your home if the tooth fairy can sometimes be a little louder than usual or the floorboards creakier than you’d like these custom tiny tooth fairy pillows from hannalah are perfect just 4″ tall with a little pocket on back with your child’s name they’re the right size to hang on a doorknob–outside the room preferably9 place the tooth in a tooth fairy dish an alternative to a pillow is a tooth fairy dish like these super cute ones we found from brick kiln on etsy we like how lovingly handmade they are and that there are designs that both boys and girls can appreciate our girls would probably like the pirate10 deliver a tooth fairy thank you note we are so taken with this adorable miniature tooth fairy thank you note from etsy’s luxely encased in a teeny corktopped
