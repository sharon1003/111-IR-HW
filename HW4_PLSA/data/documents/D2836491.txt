and break down food for proper digestion the first step of digestion starts in your mouth teeth help break down foods and saliva has enzymes by which the digestive process starts as you swallow food muscles move it through the digestive tract food then is broken down and absorbed of nutrients needed by your body for health and development function of teeth in digestion adults should have 32 teeth four of which are the wisdom teeth these four wisdom teeth might not develop at all or may be pulled at anytime due to lack of space or other reasons there are different sets of teeth and each set has a particular function teeth may be considered organs of chewing mastication and serve a very important function of the digestive process chewing food properly gives the signal to saliva to aid in the break down of certain carbohydrates the parts of the teeth that are visible are called crowns the structure of the outer layer of the crown of teeth consists of a hard outer surface called enamel this is the hardest substance in the human body molars have a large surface with pits and grooves that make them suitable for grinding food between opposing upper and lower molars there are two molars in each of the four arches of the mouth molars are the last teeth in the mouth of each quadrant there are actually three molars on each side with the “3rd molar” being the wisdom tooth incisors or the front teeth consist of sharp edges that are made for cutting food there are six upper and six lower incisors at the corner of each set of front teeth are the canines these have long roots and are designed to tear food the incisor teeth cut food and push it to the back teeth molars and premolars with the help of the tongue the back teeth actually aid in the chewing and breaking down of food with their surfaces premolars are smaller than molars and help with the chewing process by crushing food there are also two premolars in each quadrant of the mouth and they are situated inbetween the molars and incisors how saliva starts the digestive process when you eat food it’s first mixed with saliva that is secreted by sets of glands the three main salivary glands are the parotid submandibular and sublingual glands parotid glands are located at the side of the face on the inside of your cheeks they have an opening where the secretion occurs called stensen’s duct it’s the largest of the salivary glands that helps with mastication and swallowing mostly of starches submandibular glands are located on the inner side of the lower jawbone this gland produces amylase to break down starches and mucous cells to help lubricate the throat sublingual glands are located beneath the tongue they produce mucin that helps promote the production of saliva most of saliva is produced during waking hours and decreases while you sleep if you wake up with dry mouth and morning breath the reason is due to lower saliva production helping your oral hygiene the sublingual glands function to help lubricate and bind food which is needed for easy swallowing without adequate saliva with resulting dry mouth swallowing can become difficult and increase the risk of choking as food gets lodged in the throat you need healthy teeth to chew and digest food anyone who has experienced a toothache knows it’s difficult to eat if you have pain misalignment infection and missing teeth can all affect proper chewing breakdown of foods and therefore proper digestion misaligned teeth the teeth are said to be in occlusion when they fit together ideally that is the upper fit slightly over the lower teeth and the cusp tips pointy surfaces of the molars fit the grooves of the opposing molars proper occlusion keeps the cheeks and lips from being bitten and the lower teeth protect the tongue and keep it in place if your teeth do not align ideally you have malocclusion heredity poor childhood habits such as thumb sucking tongue thrusting prolonged use of pacifier or bottle can be some of the causes of malocclusion malocclusion may also have been the result of an injury or fracture of the jaw tumors can also cause malocclusion other causes can include illfitting dental fillings crowns and dentures not replacing missing teeth in a timely fashion can cause surrounding teeth to shift bringing about misalignment of teeth this malocclusion cannot only affect your appearance but also difficulty in biting or chewing foods misalignment of teeth cannot be underestimated and should be corrected prevention your ability to chew your food properly is just as important as the quality
