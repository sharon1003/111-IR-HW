dress of common men the dress of the phoenician men especially of those belonging to the lower orders consisted for the most part of a single closefitting tunic which reached from the waist to a little above the knee 1 the material was probably either linen or cotton and the simple garment was perfectly plain and unornamented like the common shenti of the egyptians on the head was generally worn a cap of one kind or another sometimes round more often conical occasionally shaped like a helmet the conical headdresses seem to have often ended in a sort of topknot or button which recalls the headdress of a chinese mandarin dress of men of the upper classes where the men were of higher rank the shenti was ornamented it was patterned and parted towards the two sides while a richly adorned lappet terminating in uræi fell down in front 2 the girdle from which it depended was also patterned and the shenti thus arranged was sometimes a not inelegant garment in addition to the shenti it was common among the upper classes to wear over the bust and shoulders a closefitting tunic with short sleeves 3 like a modern jersey and sometimes two garments were worn an inner robe descending to the feet and an outer blouse or shirt with sleeves reaching to the elbow 4 occasionally instead of this outer blouse the man of rank has a mantle thrown over the left shoulder which falls about him in folds that are sufficiently graceful 5 the conical cap with a top knot is with persons of this class the almost universal headdress treatment of the hair and beard great attention seems to have been paid to the hair and beard where no cap is worn the hair clings closely to the head in a wavy compact mass escaping however from below the wreath or diadem which supplies the place of a cap in one or two rows of crisp rounded curls 6 the beard has mostly a strong resemblance to that affected by the assyrians and familiar to us from their sculptures it is arranged in three four or five rows of small tight curls 7 and extends from ear to ear around the cheeks and chin sometimes however in lieu of the many rows we find one row only the beard falling in tresses which are curled at the extremity 8 there is no indication of the phoenicians having cultivated mustachios male ornaments for ornaments the male phoenicians wore collars which were sometimes very elaborate armlets bracelets and probably fingerrings the collars resembled those of the egyptians being arranged in three rows and falling far over the breast 9 the armlets seem to have been plain consisting of a mere twist of metal once twice or thrice around the limb 10 the royal armlets of etyander king of paphos are single twists of gold the ends of which only just overlap they are plain except for the inscription which reads eteadoro to papo basileos or the property of etyander king of paphos 11 mens bracelets were similar in character the finger rings were either of gold or silver and generally set with a stone which bore a device and which the wearer used as a seal 12supposed priestly costume the most elaborate male costume which has come down to us is that of a figure found at golgi and believed to represent a high priest of ashtoreth the conical headdress is divided into partitions by narrow stripes which beginning at its lower edge converge to a point at top this point is crowned by the representation of a calfs or bulls head the main garment is a long robe reaching from the neck to the feet worn in much the same manner as the peplos on early greek female figures round the neck of the robe are two rows of stars painted in red probably meant to represent embroidery a little below the knee is another band of embroidery from which the robe falls in folds or pleats which gather closely around the legs above the long robe is worn a mantle which covers the right arm and shoulder and thence hangs down below the right knee passing also in many folds from the shoulder across the breast and thence after a twist around the left arm falling down below the left knee the treatment of the hair is remarkable below the rim of the cap is the usual row of crisp curls but besides these there depend from behind the ears on either side of the neck three long tresses the feet of the figure are naked the right hand holds a cup by its foot between the middle and fore fingers while the left holds a dove with wings outspread 13ordinary dress of women women were for the most part draped very carefully from head to foot the nude figures which are found abundantly in the phoenician remains 14 are figures of goddesses especially of astarte who were considered not to need the ornament or the concealment of dress human female figures are in almost every case covered from the neck to the feet generally in garments with many folds which however are arranged very variously sometimes a single robe of the amplest dimensions seems to envelop the whole form which it completely conceals with heavy folds of drapery 15 the long petticoat is sleeved and gathered into a sinus below the breasts about which it hangs loosely sometimes on the contrary the petticoat is perfectly plain and has no folds 16 occasionally a second garment is worn over the gown or robe which covers the left shoulder and the lap descending to the knees or somewhat lower 17 the waist is generally confined by a girdle which is knotted in front 18 there are a few instances in which the feet are enclosed in sandals 19arrangement of their hair the hair of women is sometimes concealed under a cap but generally it escapes from such confinement and shows itself below the cap in great rolls or in wavy masses which flow off right and left from a parting over the middle of the forehead 20 tresses are worn occasionally these depend behind either ear in long loose curls which fall upon the shoulders 21 female heads are mostly covered with a loose hood or cap but sometimes the hair is merely encircled by a band or bands above and below which it ripples freely 22female ornaments phoenician women were greatly devoted to the use of personal ornaments it was probably from them that the hebrew women of isaiahs time derived the tinkling ornaments of the feet the cauls the round tires like the moon the chains the bracelets and the mufflers the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings the rings and nosejewels the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins the glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the vails 23 which the prophet denounces so fiercely the excavations made on phoenician sites have yielded in abundance necklaces armlets bracelets pendants to be worn as lockets earrings fingerrings ornaments for the hair buckles or brooches seals buttons and various articles of the toilet such as women delight in necklaces women wore it appears three or four necklaces at the same time one above the other 24 a string of small beads or pearls would closely encircle the neck just under the chin below where the chest begins would lie a second string of larger beads perhaps of gold perhaps only of glass while further down as the chest expands would be rows of still larger ornaments pendants in glass or crystal or gold or agate modelled into the shape of acorns or pomegranates or lotus flowers or cones or vases and lying side by side to the number of fifty or sixty several of the necklaces worn by the cypriote ladies have come down to us one is composed of a row of one hundred and three gold beads alternately round and oval to the oval ones of which are attached pendants also in gold representing alternately the blossom and bud of the lotus plant except in one instance the central bead of all has as its pendant a human head and bust modelled in the egyptian style with the hair falling in lappets on either side of the face and with a broad collar upon the shoulders and the breast 25 another consists of sixtyfour gold beads twentytwo of which are of superior size to the rest and of eighteen pendants shaped like the bud of a flower and delicately chased 26 there are others where gold beads are intermixed with small carnelian and onyx bugles while the pendants are of gold like the beads or where gold and rockcrystal beads alternate and a single crystal vase hangs as pendant in the middle or where alternate carnelian and gold beads have as pendant a carnelian cone a symbol of astarte 27 occasionally the sole material used is glass necklaces have been found composed entirely of long oval beads of blue or greenishblue glass others where the colour of the beads is a dark olive 28 others again where all the component parts are of glass but the colours and forms are greatly varied in a glass necklace found at tharros in sardinia besides beads of various sizes and hues there are two long rough cylinders four heads of animals and a human head as central ornament taken separately the various elements of which this necklace is composed have little value neither the heads of the animals nor the bearded human face perhaps representing bacchus are in good style the cylinders and rounded beads which fill up the intermediate spaces between the principal objects are of very poor execution but the mixture of whites and greys and yellows and greens and blues produces a whole which is harmonious and gay 29perhaps the most elegant and tasteful necklace of all that have been discovered is the one made of a thick solid gold cord very soft and elastic which is figured on the page opposite 30 at either extremity is a cylinder of very fine granulated work terminating in one case in a lions head of good execution in the other surmounted by a simple cap the lions mouth holds a ring while the cap supports a long hook which seems to issue from a somewhat complicated knot entangled wherein is a single light rosette in this arrangement in the curves of the thin wire which folds back upon itself again and again there is an air of ease an apparent negligence which is the very perfection of technical skill 31bracelets the bracelets worn by the phoenician ladies were of many kinds and frequently of great beauty some were bands of plain solid gold without ornament of any kind very heavy weighing from 200 to 300 grammes each 32 others were open and terminated at either extremity in the head of an animal one found by general di cesnola at curium in cyprus 33 exhibited at the two ends heads of lions which seemed to threaten each other the execution of the heads left nothing to be desired some others found in phoenicia proper in a state of extraordinary preservation were of similar design but in the place of lions heads exhibited the heads of bull with very short horns 34 a third type aimed at greater variety and showed the head of a wild goat at one end and that of a ram at the other 35 in a few instances the animal representation appears at one extremity of the bracelet only as in a specimen from camirus whereof the workmanship is unmistakably phoenician which has a lions head at one end and at the other tapers off like the tail of a serpent 36a pair of bracelets in the british museum said to have come from tharros consist of plain thin circlets of gold with a ball of gold in the middle the ball is ornamented with spirals and projecting knobs which must have been uncomfortable to the wearer but are said not to be wanting in elegance 37there are other phoenician bracelets of an entirely different character these consist of broad flat bands which fitted closely to the wrist and were fastened round it by means of a clasp two now in the museum of new york are bands of gold about an inch in width ornamented externally with rosettes flowers and other designs in high relief on which are visible in places the remains of a blue enamel 38 another is composed of fiftyfour largeribbed gold beads soldered together by threes and having for centre a gold medallion with a large onyx set in it and with four gold pendants 39 a third bracelet of the kind said to have been found at tharros consists of six plates united by hinges and very delicately engraved with patterns of a thoroughly phoenician character representing palms volutes and flowers 40but it is in their earrings that the phoenician ladies were most curious and most fanciful they present to us as mm perrot and chipiez note an astonishing variety 41 some which must have been very expensive are composed of many distinct parts connected with each other by chains of an elegant pattern one of the most beautiful specimens was found by general di cesnola in cyprus 42 there is a hook at top by which it was suspended then follows a medallion where the workmanship is of singular delicacy a rosette occupies the centre around it are a set of spirals negligently arranged and enclosed within a chainlike band outside of which is a double beading from the medallion depend by finely wrought chains five objects the central chain supports a human head to which is attached a conical vase covered at top on either side are two short chains terminating in rings from which hang small nondescript pendants beyond are two longer chains with small vases or bottles attached another found in sardinia is scarcely less complicated the ring which pierced the ear forms the handle of a kind of basket which is covered with lines of beadwork below attached by means of two rings is the model of a hawk with wings folded below the hawk again attached by a couple of rings is a vase of elegant shape decorated with small bosses lozenges and chevrons 43 other earrings have been found similar in type to this but simplified by the omission of the bird or of the basket 44earrings an entirely different type is that furnished by an earring in the museum of new york brought from cyprus where the loop of the ornament rises from a sort of horseshoe patterned with bosses and spirals and surrounded by a rough edging of knobs standing at a little distance one from another 45 other forms found also in cyprus are the earring with the long pendant which has been called an elongated pear 46 ornamented towards the lower end with small blossoms of flowers and terminating in a minute ball which recalls the drops that are still used by the jewellers of our day the loop which supports a crux ansata 47 that which has attached to it a small square box or measure containing a heap of grain thought to represent wheat 48 and those which support fruit of various kinds 49 an earring of much delicacy consists of a twisted ringcurved into a hook at one extremity and at the other ending in the head of a goat with a ring attached to it through which the hook passes 50 another rather curious than elegant consists of a double twist ornamented with lozenges and terminating in triangular points finely granulated 51ornaments more or less resembling this last type of earring but larger and coarser have given rise to some controversy having been regarded by some as earrings by others as fastenings for the dress and by a third set of critics as ornaments for the hair they consist of a double twist sometimes ornamented at one end only sometimes at both a lions or a griffins head crowns usually the principal end round the neck is a double or triple collar and below this a rosette very carefully elaborated in one instance two griffins show themselves side by side exhibiting their heads their chests their wings and their forepaws or hands between them is an ornament like that which commonly surmounts phoenician stelæ and below this a most beautiful rosette 52 the fashioning shows that the back of the ornament was not intended to be seen and favours the view that it was to be placed where a mass of hair would afford the necessary concealment ornaments for the hair the phoenician ladies seem also to have understood the use of hair pins which were from two to three inches long and had large heads ribbed longitudinally and crowned with two smaller balls one above the other 53 the material used was either gold or silver toilet pins and buckles to fasten their dresses the phoenician ladies used fibulæ or buckles of a simple character brooches set with stones have not at present been found on phoenician sites but in certain cases the fibulæ show a moderate amount of ornament some have glass beads strung on the pin that is inserted into the catch others have the rounded portion surmounted by the figure of a horse or of a bird 54 most fibulæ are in bronze but one found in the treasury of curium and now in the museum of new york was of gold 55 this however was most probably a votive offering a phoenician ladys toilet table it is impossible at present to reproduce the toilet table of a phoenician lady we may be tolerably sure however that certain indispensable articles would not be lacking circular mirrors either of polished metal or of glass backed by a plate of tin or silver would undoubtedly have found their place on them together with various vessels for holding perfumes and ointments a vase in rock crystal discovered at curium with a funnel and cover in gold the latter attached by a fine gold chain to one of its handles 56 was doubtless a fine ladys favourite smelling bottle various other vessels in silver of a small size 57 as basins and bowls beautifully chased tiny jugs alabasti ladles c had also the appearance of belonging rather to the toilet table than to the plate basket some of the alabasti would contain kohl or stibium some salves and ointments others perhaps perfumed washes for the complexion among the bronze objects found 58 some may have been merely ornaments others stands for rings bracelets and the like one terracotta vase from dali seems made for holding pigments 59 and raises the suspicion that phoenician or at any rate cyprian beauties were not above heightening their charms by the application of paint freedom enjoyed by phoenician women women in phoenicia seem to have enjoyed considerable freedom they are represented as banqueting in the company of men sometimes sitting with them on the same couch sometimes reclining with them at the same table 60 occasionally they delight their male companion by playing upon the lyre or the double pipe 61 while in certain instances they are associated in bands of three who perform on the lyre the double pipe and the tambourine 62 they take part in religious processions and present offerings to the deities 63 the positions occupied in history by jezebel and elissar dido fall in with these indications and imply a greater approach to equality between the sexes in phoenicia than in oriental communities generally active habits of the men the men were for orientals unusually hardy and active in only one instance is there any appearance of the use of the parasol by a phoenician 64 sandals are infrequently worn neck chest arms and legs are commonly naked the rough life of seamen hardened the greater number others hunted the wild ox and the wild boar 65 in the marshy plains of the coast tract and in the umbrageous dells of lebanon even the lion may have been affronted in the great mountain and if we are unable to describe the method of its chase in phoenicia the reason is that the phoenician artists have in their representations of lion hunts adopted almost exclusively assyrian models 66 the phoenician gift of facile imitation was a questionable advantage since it led the native artists continually to substitute for sketches at first hand of scenes with which they were familiar conventional renderings of similar scenes as depicted by foreigners curious agate ornament an ornament found in cyprus the intention of which is uncertain finds its proper place in the present chapter though we cannot attach it to any particular class of objects it consists of a massive knob of solid agate with a cylinder of the same both above and below through which a rod or bar must have been intended to pass some archæologists see in it the top of a sceptre 67 others the head of a mace 68 but there is nothing really to prove its use we might imagine it the adornment of a throne or chair of state or the end of a chariot pole or a portion of the stem of a candelabrum antiquity has furnished nothing similar with which to compare it and we only say of it that whatever was its purpose so large and so beautiful a mass of agate has scarcely been met with elsewhere 69 the cutting is such as to show very exquisitely the veining of the material use in furniture of bronze and ivory bronze objects in almost infinite variety have been found on phoenician sites 70 but only a few of them can have been personal ornaments they comprise lamps bowls vases jugs cups armlets anklets daggers dishes a horses bit heads and feet of animals statuettes mirrors fibulæ buttons c furniture would seem to have been largely composed of bronze which sometimes formed its entire fabric though generally confined to the ornamentation ivory was likewise employed in considerable quantities in the manufacture of furniture 71 to which it was applied as an outer covering or veneer either plain or more generally carved with a pattern or with figures the ivory house of ahab 72 was perhaps so called not so much from the application of the precious material to the doors and walls as from its employment in the furniture there is every probability that it was the construction of phoenician artists
