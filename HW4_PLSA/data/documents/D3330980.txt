very friendly owner i had a pleasant time at this inn it is only about 30 minutes off of the pa turnpike so it was a great place to stop for the night on my way through pa to nyc the pricing was very reasonable for the quality the host bob was very hospitable he explained to me how sites like expedia hotelscom etc raise hotel rates during busy times to make more money but that the actual hotel usually doesnt so it is a good idea to find where you want to stay on such a website and then call the hotel directly to book bob also put me in a room that he thought had good access to the wifi because it was not working perfectly that night he also provided me with a bottle water when i was about to get on the road free of charge overall it was a great and inexpensive experience i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay for a night driving through pa stayed december 2016 traveled solo location cleanliness service ask jeff t about budget inn thank jeff tthis

road trip we were pleasantly surprised by this budget motel room was clean and tidy and the staff were very helpful as with most motels in america there was no coffeemaker or kettle just a microwave being english makes it difficult to make a cup of tea and yes i do travel with teabags which is sad i know breakfast was included but just a couple of cereals and some prepackaged pastries hens the 4

opinion of a trip advisor member and not of trip advisor llc silver zebra maryland25 34reviewed october 18 2016the best place to stay in williamsport the budget inn is a very pleasant surprise a modern motel with great service and excellent rates in some ways it seems just like any other budget motel it’s just that it is better than most the room was clean comfortable and reasonably sized furnishings seemed clean and new a reasonable breakfast is included bob and his wife are helpful very friendly and seem completely competent the location in a quiet section of town is off the main road but very accessible it sure appears that one of the best motels in the area is also the east expensive room tip there is no elevator for second floor rooms see more room tips stayed october 2016
