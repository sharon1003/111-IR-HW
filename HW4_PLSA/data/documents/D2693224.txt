apolipoprotein b apo bapolipoprotein b apo b is an important component of many lipoproteins that are involved in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease atherosclerosis may be described as a chronic inflammation in the arterial wall it is caused by a complex interplay between lipoproteins white blood cells macrophages the immune system and the normal elements of the arterial wall this process leads to formations of atherosclerotic lesions or plaques that may protrude into the lumen of the artery causing arterial narrowing which may ultimately limit blood flow if this occurs in the coronary arteries it may cause angina pectoris and if it occurs in the arteries of the legs it may cause claudication rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque may lead to thrombosis blood clotting causing an acute occlusion blockage of the artery if this happens in a coronary artery it may cause an acute myocardial infarction acute heart attack there are many factors that contribute to atherosclerosis one of which is elevated blood levels of cholesterol cholesterol and lipoproteins although cholesterol is an essential substance elevated plasma levels appear to play an important role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis in animal models atherosclerosis will not occur in the absence of greatly elevated levels of plasma cholesterol high levels of plasma cholesterol also appear to be an important contributor to atherosclerosis in humans although the threshold level of plasma cholesterol that must be exceeded to produce clinically relevant disease appears to be much lower than that in animal models possibly because lesion formation occurs over many decades atherosclerotic clinical events such as myocardial infarction are uncommon among individuals with lifelong very low plasma cholesterol levels because fats are insoluble in water cholesterol can not be transported in blood on its own the body’s solution to this problem is to bind cholesterol to certain proteins that function as transport vehicles carrying different types of fats such as cholesterol triglycerides tg and phospholipids these combinations of fats and protein are termed lipoproteins it is important to emphasize that it is lipoprotein that interact with the arterial wall and initiate the cascade of events that leads to atherosclerosis cholesterol is only one of many components of lipoproteins therefore measurements of total cholesterol provide little information about the lipoproteins that transport the bulk of cholesterol there is a strong and graded correlation between low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc and the risk of cvd both in women and men although this has been debated by some investigators measurements of the number of ldlparticles ldlp appear more predictive of risk than measurements of the cholesterol mass within these particles or ldlcholesterol  ldlc  although ldl’s seem to be the most atherogenic particles it has to remembered that vldl and other apo b – containing lipoproteins may also contribute to atherosclerosis apolipoprotein b apo blipoproteins are the particles that transport cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood stream lipoproteins are comprised of proteins apolipoproteins phospholipids triglycerides and cholesterol the lipoproteins vary in the major lipoprotein present and the relative contents of the different lipid components apo b is an important component of many of the most atherogenic lipoprotein particles apo b occurs in 2 main forms apo b 48 and apo b 100 apo b 48 is synthesized mainly by the small intestine apo b 100 is the apolipoprotein found in lipoproteins synthesized by the liver therefore from the viewpoint of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk apo b100 is the important one apo b 48 is primarily found in chylomicrons apo b 100 is found in chylomicrons vldl idl ldl and lp a particles all these particles are atherogenic each of these particles contains a single apo b molecule therefore measurements of apo b represent the total burden of the main lipoprotein particles involved in the atherosclerotic process usually 8590 percent of apo b represent ldl particles thus apo b reflects particle concentration similar to ldlp although measurements of apo b are not widely available the assay has been standardized and does not require a fasting sample several studies have shown that apo b may be a better predictor of cardiovascular disease risk than ldlc furthermore it has been shown that apo b may be elevated despite normal or low concentrations of ldlc apo b also appears to predict ontreatment risk when ldlc has been lowered by statin therapy the interheart study found that the apo bapo a1 ratio is more effective at predicting heart attack risk than either the apo b or apo a1 measure alone apo b containing lipoproteins are the ones that are most likely to enter the wall of the arteries they are capable of trafficking cholesterol into the artery wall and if present in increased numbers they may be the main initiating factor in atherosclerosis retention of apo b containing lipoprotein particles within the arterial wall is an essential part of the process normal range for apo bthe normal range for apo b is 40125 mgd l usually less than 100 mgd l is considered desirable in low or intermediate risk individuals less than 80 mgd l is desirable in high risk individuals such as those with cardiovascular disease or diabetes how to lower apo bmany doctors will recommend the same general measures to lower apo b as they do for lowering ldlc thus reducing the amount of saturated fats and cholesterol is often recommended together with increased consumption of vegetables fiber and monoand polyunsaturated omega3 fatty acids some studies have indicated that carbohydrate restriction may lower apo b independent of whether the intake of saturated fat is low or high ldlc was not lowered by carbohydrate restriction in these studies suggesting that diet may affect apo b and ldlc differently physical exercise has also been shown to lower apo b and positively affect the apo bapo a1 ratio but the effect on ldlc appears to be much smaller apo b levels can be reduced by cholesterol lowering drugs statins share 120 tweet share 1 1 5 pin 2
