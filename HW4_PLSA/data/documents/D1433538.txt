q do i need to have a passport to go on a disney cruise a this is a question i actually get asked more than any other when it comes to cruising with disney if you are a us citizen taking part in one of disney’s european atlantic crossings or panama canal cruises then yes a passport is required however for disney cruise lines sailings to the bahamas bermuda caribbean and mexican riviera disney requires valid proof of citizenship which can be one of the following a valid us passport a valid us passport card a valid trusted traveler card nexus sentri fastan alternative would be to bring along a governmentissued photo id with the following state issued birth certificate consular report of a birth abroad certificate of naturalization if you’re under the age of 16 you don’t need to show photo id but must present one of the three documents listed above guests should note that these requirements may change for one way itineraries where a client is flying home from a foreign country for canadians a passport or a trusted traveler card is essential for all other foreign citizens you must meet the entry requirements for your country but will more than likely need a passport and possibly an entry visa depending on your nationality alaskan cruises documentation requirements vary depending on how you arrive into canada for a complete list of travel documentation requirements by destination click here i’m a us citizen heading to the bahamas so this means i don’t need to get passports for my family right read carefully even though you may not “technically” need a passport to go on a cruise i would never recommend to my clients that you travel without one the reason being is that you are essentially travelling abroad the disney cruise ships are flagged in the bahamas which means you are subject to bahamian and international maritime law even if you weren’t planning on disembarking at a foreign port unforeseeable things can happen that may make you wish you’d splurged for those passports for instance let’s say there was an emergency and you needed to fly home getting a flight out of a foreign country requires a passport if you require medical attention at a foreign port you can also run into problems without a passport if officials question your documentation having backup can save you from being turned away plus when travelling with children there’s that extra piece of mind that comes with having photo identification for each member of your family so though you might be trying to save yourself the cost of passports in the long run it is the much safer option to have them at the ready to make sure that things run as smoothly as possible and just a word of caution if you are applying for passports for the very first time give yourself an ample window by which to have everything in order and over to disney cruise line for verification they will ask you for you passport number 75 days prior to your cruise departure date i heard that i need to get
