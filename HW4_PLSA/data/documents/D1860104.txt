why do mexicans have so many kids01092014 eric valenzuela why do mexicans have so many kids it’s a stereotype that is not entirely inaccurate that of a dozen kids piling into the single car of a mexican family i myself only have one sibling and by mexican standard that makes for a very small family my parents also came from relatively small families my mother as one of four children and my father the same i do have a couple of aunts and uncles who have had five children and that seems to be a little more like it but the ones who take the tamale have got to be my buddy david’s parents his mother and father are one of seven and one of twelve respectively i’ve got a total of over twenty cousins just counting the first cousins and on christmas it does make for a full house it was always a sad event to find yourself at the back of the piñata line at birthday party because there was absolutely no hope of taking a whack at that thing but i’ve been to david’s house on christmas eve and there are so many mexicans there you would think they were giving away  insert your own joke here i suggest the following budweiser green cards jobs in front of the home depot tacos… the possibilities are endless several answers it does beg the question what’s up with mexicans having so many kids this query does not have one simple answer but i have my theories first there’s the reason that all agriculture based economies had so many kids just like america prior to ww2 families on the farm needed the farm hands same goes for mexican farms but that isn’t the only answer the second reason off the top of my head is catholicism there are some strict interpretations of the bible that some argue prohibit any and all forms of birth control the old catholic guilt will tell you that the only purpose for sex is to procreate in fact the only reason a man’s seed should ever leave his body is for this reason otherwise he is guilty of onanism which is just a fancy dirty word named after onan a guy from the bible cultural values of mexicans third it’s just one of the dominant cultural values mexican families place great value on the family and on taking care of one another in a way that is very different from american values it isn’t as common or acceptable for a child to go away to college far away and never return nor is it considered acceptable to place the old and infirmed in an oldfolks home the elders are to stay with the family and that’s that this sense of family togetherness is related to the desire to have a large family i don’t really think there is much else to it than that the farm the nobirthcontrolofanykind and the family togetherness to those of you who are waiting to start a family i would suggest this don’t even look at a mexican woman the wrong way especially if she still has her catholic school uniform because you could end up a daddy before you know it comparte esto facebook imprimir google twitter correo electrónico linked in másaunts and uncles catholic guilt christmas eve dozen kidsfirst cousins forms of birth control green cards hispanic lainterpretations of the bible mexicans mother and father onanismtamale
