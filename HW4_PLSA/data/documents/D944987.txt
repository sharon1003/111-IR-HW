what is autonomous emergency braking aeb put simply aeb is a safety technology that takes into account the traffic conditions ahead and will automatically brake the car if the driver fails to respond to the conditions it’s probably the most significant development in car safety since the seat belt and could save an astonishing 1100 lives and 122860 casualties in the uk over the next ten years so rather than protect the driver using the seatbelt and airbag in a crash situation aeb aims to prevent the crash in the first place that means less expense and hassle for drivers… and who doesn’t want

crashes’ concluded a 2015 study by euro ncap and australasian ncapinsurance claims third party injury claims on the golf vii with aeb were 45 lower than its equivalent in our analysis of uk insurance data how does aeb work aeb systems rely on a number of different technologies to monitor your vehicles’ immediate road environment and to detect and identify potential collision threats if a critical situation is identified and the driver fails to react appropriately the aeb system can automatically apply the brakes to avoid the crash altogether or lessen the impact the aeb technology on board your vehicle can often be dependent on the vehicles particular make and model aeb systems can use lidar radar camera or a fusion of all three technologies and this is critical to the speed range over which the system can effectively operate and the types of hazard that the vehicle is able to identify and avoid autonomous emergency braking how does it work your browser does not currently recognize

specific trade names to describe their aeb systems including city safety volvo smart city brake support mazda active city stop ford and city emergency braking volkswagen confusing matters further different aeb systems also have different capabilities in terms of the speed at which they are effective from low speed ‘city’ systems to higher speed ‘inter urban’ and then on to pedestrian detection
