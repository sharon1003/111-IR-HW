duplexer transmitter receiver figure 1 simplified functional block diagram of a radar using a duplexer whenever a single antenna is used for both transmitting and receiving as in a radar system an electronic switch must be used switching systems of this type are called duplexers switching the antenna between the transmit and receive modes presents one problem ensuring that maximum use is made of the available energy is another the simplest solution is to use a switch to transfer the antenna connection from the receiver to the transmitter during the transmitted pulse and back to the receiver during the echo pulse no practical mechanical switches are available that can open and close in a few microseconds therefore electronic switches must be used duplexers are constructed in many forms such as ferrite circulators hybridring duplexer orresonant cavity coaxial or waveguide systemswith tr and atr tubesor with pin diodes since waveguide and hybridring duplexers are most common in radar systems the simplest solution would be here to use a ferrite circulator  however it is complicated to make circulators for top performances up to many 100 k w in the practice in addition circulators have a decoupling of hardly more as 30 to 40 d b and cannot protect the highly sensitive receiver from the high transmit powers sufficiently on the other hand a circulator can provide the receiver with an echo signal during the transmission time it has not the limitations of a so called blind range like other duplexer systems circulators as duplexer are predetermined for radar sets with a very low transmitters peak power like the dpr886therefore tr and atrtubes are used unfortunately duplexers need a reaction time situated in the nanosecond area the full transmit power reaches the receiver in this time you may increase the speed with which the gap breaks down after the transmitter fires by placing a voltage of about 800 to 1200 v across the gap electrodes this voltage is known as keepalive voltage this action provides for rapid ionization when the transmitter pulse arrives efficient pin diodes dont have this disadvantage publisher christian wolff text is available under the gnu free documentation license and the creative commons attributionshare alike 30 unported license additional terms may apply
