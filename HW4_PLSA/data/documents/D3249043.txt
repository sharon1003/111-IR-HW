morgan they were struck in every year from 1878 to 1904 and revived again in 1921 for a single year initially the coin was created to benefit the silver mining companies when congress passed the blandallison act that effectively dictated the number of coins produced each month the law artificially inflated the price of silver to satisfy the mining interests hundreds of millions of these coins never went into circulation and were stored in cloth bags containing 1000 coins each the treasury department then stored the bags in government vaults in 1918 a total of 270232722 coins were melted but many coins remained inside the government vaults for decades although the mint produced proof coins in some years not all coins that have a cameo contrast are considered proof coins coins that have a deep mirror prooflike dmpl finish were made for circulation many circulated coins are worth only their bullion value however some morgan dollars are very valuable  detailed specifications
