two cofounders kevin systrom and mike krieger together founded instagram mike or “mikey” is one of the most selfeffacing engineers and user experience designers  at the time he was toiling away at meebo he would test their interface with groups of high school students he brought into the company’s mountain view office funnily enough while in university he actually worked on a photosharing project for a class it was a featurephoneera app for treating seasonal affective disorder the idea was that one user on one side of the world would send a photo of sunshine to another in a wintery climate with fewer hours of daylight just to cheer them up systrom meanwhile had just come off of a year at nextstop a traveloriented startup that had sold to facebook in a talent acquisition he had also spent a year in google’s corporate development department read the department that does ma but after interning at the company that would become twitter he always had the itch to do something on his own in early 2010 systrom was messing around with a few ideas back then location was hot hot hot foursquare had launched about a year earlier and had made the checkin a cultural phenomenon it made sense to experiment with location perhaps an html5based checkin app was the way to go so systrom ever the connoisseur of fine whiskeys tested an app called burbn it was very basic it had about four tabs you could “move” or check in somewhere new users weren’t exactly checking in all the time on burbn instead we were sharing photos latte photos dog photos beer photos photos of our reflection in the bathroom mirror taken with an i phone just mundane photos of everyday life it was around this time that krieger who was ready for change after a year and a half at meebo came on board he ended up being a fantastic complement to systrom who had honed his programming skills while building burbn krieger joined systrom in dogpatch labs when it was still at san francisco’s pier 38 the pair looked at how users in burbn’s beta gravitated toward photosharing and then studied every single popular app in the photography category they scrapped burbn and started over it seems obvious in retrospect but it wasn’t clear at the time that this the was right move the photography category seemed saturated but systrom saw an opening that many others didn’t hipstamatic was superfun and came packaged with all of these filters but it wasn’t very social systrom thought there was a sweet spot in between hipstamatic and facebook and that’s precisely where instagram landed it took several months of prototyping and experimentation there was a precursor to instagram called scotch but it didn’t have filters and it was slow and buggy yet the concept of photosharing kept calling out to them with their ux skills krieger and systrom refined instagram to require as few actions as possible unlike the original version of path instagram didn’t force users to add tags about people or places to their photos a photo could be posted in as few as three clicks mirroring twitter they made instagram public by default after months of testing instagram launched on oct 06 2010 systrom and krieger didn’t know exactly what to expect but 25000 users showed up on the first day for late 2010 when there were fewer i phones on the market that was a big number the traffic was so overwhelming that they didn’t get home until 6 am the next day after that it was just a whirlwind ride instagram had nailed the timing the i phone 4 was just arriving and its camera was finally good enough to cannibalize pointandshoot cameras apple also had an installed base of i os devices that was now large enough to produce the network effects that instagram needed to take off instagram hit one million users in three months then that became two million which then became 10 million users unlike many apps at the top of the charts instagram didn’t have to spend a dime to get where it was it was organic growth source  httptechcrunchcom20120409
