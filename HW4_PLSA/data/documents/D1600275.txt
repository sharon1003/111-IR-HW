version information the new international version niv is a completely original translation of the bible developed by more than one hundred scholars working from the best available hebrew aramaic and greek texts the initial vision for the project was provided by a single individual – an engineer working with general electric in seattle by the name of howard long long was a lifelong devotee of the king james version but when he shared it with his friends he was distressed to find that it just didn’t connect long saw the need for a translation that captured the truths he loved in the language that his contemporaries spoke for 10 years long and a growing group of likeminded supporters drove this idea the passion of one man became the passion of a church and ultimately the passion of a whole group of denominations and finally in 1965 after several years of preparatory study a transdenominational and international group of scholars met in palos heights illinois and agreed to begin work on the project – determining to not simply adapt an existing english version of the bible but to start from scratch with the best available manuscripts in the original languages their conclusion was endorsed by a large number of church leaders who met in chicago in 1966 a selfgoverning body of fifteen biblical scholars the committee on bible translation cbt was formed and charged with responsibility for the version and in 1968 the new york bible society which subsequently became the international bible society and then biblica generously undertook the financial sponsorship of the project the translation of each book was assigned to translation teams each made up of two lead translators two translation consultants and a stylistic consultant where necessary the initial translations produced by these teams were carefully scrutinized and revised by intermediate editorial committees of five biblical scholars to check them against the source texts and assess them for comprehensibility each edited text was then submitted to a general committee of eight to twelve members before being distributed to selected outside critics and to all members of the cbt in preparation for a final review samples of the translation were tested for clarity and ease of reading with pastors students scholars and lay people across the full breadth of the intended audience perhaps no other translation has undergone a more thorough process of review and revision from the very start the niv sought to bring modern bible readers as close as possible to the experience of the very first bible readers providing the best possible blend of transparency to the original documents and comprehension of the original meaning in every verse with this clarity of focus however came the realization that the work of translating the niv would never be truly complete as new discoveries were made about the biblical world and its languages and as the norms of english usage developed and changed over time the niv would also need to change to hold true to its original vision and so in the original niv charter provision was made not just to issue periodic updates to the text but also to create a mechanism for constant monitoring of changes in biblical scholarship and english usage the cbt was charged to meet every year to review maintain and strengthen the niv’s ability to accurately and faithfully render god’s unchanging word in modern english the 2011 update to the niv is the latest fruit of this process by working with input from pastors and bible scholars by grappling with the latest discoveries about biblical languages and the biblical world and by using cuttingedge research on english usage the committee on bible translation has updated the text to ensure that the new international version of the bible remains faithful to howard long’s original inspiration
