2015in the last update to the software for nokia 225 browser opera mini v4439007 20150615 oemnokia there is not work properly on the russian ukrainian sites  the words are cut in width that is simply no end in so many words i suspect that the problem is smoothed fonts used in the new firmware versions after 100111 websites with latin displayed normally opera mini reformats pages correctly however the cyrillic characters are wider and the words just do not fit in the designated rows and therefore have problems with cutting words naturally about comfortable reading sites are not talking but the phone is positioned including for this purpose having a screen diagonal 28 inches i would like to hear the comments of the company tested whether any work correctly before releasing firmware given the proliferation of phone on russianspeaking markets a bug with internet browser can be considered critical because nokia xpress server will be disconnected in december and those who want to continue to use the internet on this phone  will need to update the firmware and they will be disappointed reply up vote 1armagonfin replied on september 22 2015microsoft in reply to miksins post on september 22
