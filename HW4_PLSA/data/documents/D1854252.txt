january 0603pm ethancharlotteriley wa australia total posts 1611nope i had dialated about 23cms and the whole cervix was up behind his head they the docmidwife could barely reach itit was not like in all the pictures where babies head sits on top of the cervix it was behind or closer to my bum the doc put her fingers in the cervix and manually moved it forwards so the babies head was pushing down on the cervix to make it dialate needless to say it was very very painful posted friday 23 january 0650pm thesagemother qld australia total posts 708how active where you during labour andor pregnancy

australia total posts 708are you private maybe you should ask a midwife theyre specifically are trained in pregnancy birth and post natalthey are all women as well so you will get some sympathy and should get a good answer posted sunday 25 january 0524pm cyathea qld australia total posts 468were you induced sometimes if you are induced your cervix has not had time to move from posterior position to anterior and malpositioning can be a problemhomebirthing mum to three boysposted sunday 25 january 0649pm ethancharlotteriley wa australia total posts 1611nope went into labour 2 days after my due date after 20 hours of full on contractions and them doing very very little i had the cervix moved and i was induced to speed things up i had my waters broken they also broke before my cervix was moved and had a sintocin sp drip bub was born 5 12 hours later it was the actual act of them moving my cervix that i wanted to avoid as it was so painful or if i should be expecting it i have never heard of anyone else having it moved so i just dont know posted sunday 25 january 0837pm thesagemother qld australia total posts 708i found something interesting smile i dont know if it applies tho a common question is about posterior cervices cervices plural of cervix are mobile in the vagina they move from front to back side to side and round and round nonpregnant they tend to stay in the same neighborhood but in pregnancy the heads depth can bring the cervix front and center or the head can come down while the cervix is still posterior facing more towards the back of the vagina when we do a vaginal exam and find a cervix posterior it means we feel the babys head first and have to either reach around the head to find the cervical os or sometimes we walk the cervix up with our fingers one major thing a woman can do to bring her cervix more forward for an exam is to sit on her fists i have women make a fist and then keeping them upright put them under her hips that position almost always works wonders for finding a posterior cervix not always though when a woman is in labor the uterus contracting brings the cervix forward  where it needs to be for the baby to come out if a woman is having vaginal exams or doing them herself its a pretty good indication of active labor whether the cervix is anterior nearer the front or posterior anterior would signal active labor posterior usually means theres some work still do to of course there are always exceptions but generally this is the case before labor having an anterior or posterior labor has zero indication of anything your provider might say its a great sign for it to be anterior but ive seen many a posterior cervix in early labor bring a baby out a few hours after that exam an anterior cervix can take its own sweet time dilating before active labor id not give any credence to where the cervix is at all as far as i can tell having the cervix move from posterior to anterior isnt any more work or cause any more pain during labor dilating is enough of an attentiongetter one more point if people keep their hands out of your vagina they wouldnt know where your cervix is and it wouldnt matter one iota the baby comes out really posted sunday 25 january 0913pm cyathea qld australia total posts 468that is interesting info tsm smile mum2ethan  ouch that does sound nasty for second and subsequent labours your cervix is usually a lot more effaced and dilated naturally before you go into labour so the chances of it happening again are probably quite low all the best smile edited on
