a perfect night’s sleep15 mar 2010  by dr david s kantra sleep how did you sleep last night when you put your head on your pillow did you go straight to sleep or were you suddenly wide awake it has been estimated that as many as 40 percent of americans will suffer from some form of sleep disturbance at one time or another if you have trouble sleeping — or waking up — this is the article for you before we begin answer these questions and solve an easy math problem do you wake up alert or groggy  how many hours do you sleep on an average night  do you use a snooze alarm  take the total number of hours you sleep and divide it by 15 first let’s discuss how sleep works we sleep in 90minute cycles think of each cycle as a “v” imagine that the top of the “v” on the left side is the point where you place your head on the pillow upon getting in bed you take a little while to think over the day and say your prayers then mr or ms sandman shows up and off to sleep you go it takes 45 minutes to float down into the deepest point of your first sleep cycle if you’re awakened while in this stage of sleep you’ll feel very disturbed but as soon as you reach this deep phase you start on your way back up the right side of the “v” toward a lighter sleep it then takes another 45 minutes to waft upward to the top part of the “v” on the righthand side the top of the cycle is the shallowest period of sleep during this time you dream and you can be easily awakened when you finish this 90minute “v” cycle you then enter a new cycle — down the lefthand side again toward the shallow sleep stage where dreams occur the cycles then look something like this “vvvvv” — up and down up and down throughout the night recurring regularly approximately every 90 minutes until you wake up so you wonder how can you use this information to your advantage that’s where your answers to the earlier questions come into play let’s take a look at your answers in reverse order take the total number of hours you sleep and divide it by 15 one and onehalf hours of sleep if you sleep an average of six hours per night your sleep is divided into approximately four 90minute sleep cycles if you sleep seven and a half hours per night then you experience five 90minute sleep cycles per night the trick is not to wake up while you’re somewhere in the deeper levels of the sleep cycle rather you really want to awaken at the end of a sleep cycle when the body is naturally primed to wake up here’s a concrete example let’s say you go to bed at 1100 pm and your alarm clock is set to go off at 530 am that’s six and a half hours of sleep or four cycles and some fraction left over when your alarm goes off your body is descending into the deepsleep phase of a cycle this isn’t good you will likely wake up feeling groggy rather than brighteyed and bushytailed  how many hours do you sleep each night any answer is of course acceptable but the ideal answer is in multiples of 90 minutes that means an individual should plan for six hours four 90minute cycles seven and a half hours five 90minute cycles or nine hours six 90minute cycles of sleep each night health experts have found the seven and a half hours is the amount of sleep most often associated with good health  do you awaken alert or groggy once again if you plan your sleep night in complete 90minute cycles you’ll wake up ready to go if you set your clock to wake up somewhere within a cycle it will be harder to get up and get going remember that your children sleep in cycles too they’ll awaken more easily if you rouse them at the end of a sleep cycle provided you know when it is that they actually go to bed  do you use a snooze alarm if you answered “yes” then your alarm clock is probably set to go off when you’re somewhere in the middle of a 90minute cycle rather than at the end of one so you snooze snooze snooze…until you reach a point in your cycle where your body is ready to wake up planning your sleep night in multiples of the 90minute cycles and then setting your alarm accordingly will make your snooze alarm obsolete bottom line if you plan your night of sleep in multiples of 90minute cycles your sleep will be more refreshing and perhaps your dreams will be more pleasant it’s also more likely that you’ll wake up on the right side of the bed which will be appreciated by allreferences buffington perry
