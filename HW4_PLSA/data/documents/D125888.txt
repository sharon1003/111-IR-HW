shoulder pain and immobility for which the underlying cause is unknown janet travell the author of myofascial pain and dysfunction the trigger point manual speaking of the medical literature on frozen shoulder says “when so many authors agree that the cause of a disease is enigmatic there is good reason to expect that a major etiologic factor is being overlooked”this major factor according to travell is trigger points in the subscapularis muscle acupuncture can eliminate these trigger points wiping out frozen shoulder for good and offering people an alternative to the common — yet usually only temporarily effective — protocol of pain killers cortisone shots and surgery olympic swimmers who recently dazzled us with their performances take heed freestyle swimming is one of the most

to the inner surface of the scapula and to the front of the humerus bone its primary responsibility is to hold the humerus in place during arm movements preventing displacement it also helps internally rotate the head of the humerus trigger points are sensitive nodules in the musculature that cause referred pain in the subscapularis muscle they produce a signature painreferral pattern pain concentrates on the back of the deltoid muscle from there it can extend onto the back over the scapula andor down the back side of the upper arm pain usually skips the forearm but appears again as a band around the wrist see picture here  earlystage subscapularis trigger points normally don’t prevent people from reaching up however reaching backward — as if you were getting ready to throw a ball — tends to be painful this is why frozen shoulder and adhesive capsulitis are sometimes referred to as pitcher’s arm another telltale sign of earlystage subscapularis trigger points is wrist pain

pain might be coming from trigger points in the subscapularis muscle here are some common ways in which these trigger points get activated1 overdoing it at activities that require medial rotation of the arm examples include freestyle swimming and throwing a baseball2 forceful overhead lifting while adducting the arm bringing it closer to your body an example is the kettleball swing exercise where you use outstretched arms to raise the kettleball from between the legs3 sudden stress placed on the shoulder muscles due to a humerus fracture or shoulder joint tear or breaking a fall once a trigger point is activated — in the subscapularis or any muscle — it’s commonly perpetuated or exaggerated by everyday movements sleeping on one’s side or having slumpedforward posture can make subscapularis trigger points worse remedies for subscaprelated shoulder pain once you’ve identified subscapularis trigger points as the source of your shoulder pain and immobility there are several steps you can

the painful part of the body for example the small intestine meridian runs directly along the signature painreferral pattern for subscapularis trigger points an acupuncturist might choose to needle an acupuncture point on the small intestine meridian that’s farther down the body small intestine 3 for example is an acupuncture point on the side of the hand see picture here that’s frequently used to

subscapularisrelated shoulder pain is adjust your posture — while awake and sleeping during waking hours try and avoid the slumpedforward posture that so many of us have unfortunately developed as a result of sustained computer use this postion forces the arms into a mediallyrotated position which perpetuates trigger points in the subscapularis when standing try hooking your thumbs into your belt or pants to prevent your arms from touching your sides and when you’re at your desk remember to frequently move your arms — a simple movement of reaching the arm up and behind the head will do it — to help keep the subscapularis muscle stretched3 sleep with a pillow at bedtime grab an extra pillow if you’re sleeping on the painful side place the pillow between your elbow and side of the body again this abducts the arm away from the body which stretches the subscapularis muscle if you sleep on the painfree side put the pillow in front of you so that the painful arm can rest on it pretend you’re
