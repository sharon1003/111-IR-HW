baitullah 3umrah in ramadan performing umrah during ramadan is most commendable and equal to hajj in merit and excellence 4clarification it is quite true that an umrah in ramadan equals a hajj and one can get the same rewards that are granted to one who performs a hajj but this act does not substitute the performance of hajj which is fard imperative once in a life time if one is financially and physically capable rules for umrahumrah is sunnat muakidah umrah is neither imperative fard nor obligatory wajib but performing umrah once in a life time is sunnat muakidah however once or more than once whenever it is performed it fetches great rewards no fixed time there is no fixed month day or time for umrah as it is for hajj as said earlier it can be performed any time one desires the miqat

bounds of the haram of mecca is called hill the afaqis outsiders who come to mecca for hajj and umrah should already be in ihram before entering into mecca however for subsequent umrahs even they have to go to hill to put on ihram for this purpose buses outside bab abdul aziz of alharam take pilgrims to masjid aaisha which is in hill on madinah road at taneem not far from mecca the rites of umrah the only rites of umrah are entering the state of ihram tawaf of kabah sayee between the hills of safa and marwah shaving or clipping of the hair in umrah pilgrims do not go to mina arafat and

to perform umrahihram for umrah and entering masjid alharaamihram you should be already in ihram for umrah before entering mecca or as mentioned earlier enter the state of ihram at masjid aisha in hill if it is your subsequent umrah or if you are the resident of the haram of mecca or of hill if you are entering into ihram now the next step is to cover your head and offer two rakahs of nafl then uncover your head intend to perform umrah and proclaim talbiyah three times and as often afterwards as possible this starts all the restrictions of ihram which are listed in the description of hajj

supplicate to allah and proceed towards kabah you may recite the following supplication which is usually used before entering a mosque allah huma aftah li abwabe rahmate ka first sight at the first sight of kabah keep your eyes fixed at baitullah and standing at one side it is suggested that you do the following say allahu akbar three times say la ilaha illallah three times proclaim darud on our beloved prophet peace be upon him and very humbly and with tears in your eyes supplicate to allah for whatever you wish this is a special time for the acceptance of prayers the idea is to praise and glorify your creator before proclaiming darud and supplications therefore in lieu of allahu akbar and la ilaha illallah you may recite some other similar holy verses if you so desire after this while uttering talbiyah move forward to perform tawaf of kabah tawaf of umrahtawaf means circling around something  here it means moving around kabah seven times with extreme love and devotion preparation

talbiyah is stopped when you reach hajareaswad the starting point of tawaf niyyah intention stand in front of kabah facing hajareaswad the black stone in such a way that the whole hajreeaswad is on your right side to achieve this end you may get help from the black stripe on the floor this stripe should be on your right side then without raising your hands make niyyah intention for umrah  o

counter clockwise warningthe authorities often apply perfume to hajareaswad rukn yamani and multazam if so do not touch them while in the state of ihram otherwise a dum will be required as a penalty during tawaf it is not permissible to face or turn your back towards kabah except when you are kissing or pointing towards hajareaswad ramal for the first three circuits of tawaf of umrah and tawaf of arrival men are required to move their shoulders and walk with quick short steps this act is called ramal and is sunnah they walk normally during the remaining four circuits supplications of tawaf there are no fixed supplications for tawaf but there are several recommended supplications listed in the books of hajj and umrah out of which the following supplication is easy to memorize subhanallah walhamdulillahi wa la ilaha illallah waallahu akbar wa la haula wa la quwwata illabillah if you dont remember these words you may glorify allah by repeatedly uttering subhan allah alhamdu lilla allahu akbar la ilaha illallah etc the prophet of islam peace be upon him has said that there are two kalimahs that are light on tongue and on the day of judgment they weigh heavy on the scale mizan and are liked by allah these kalimahs are subhan allah wabe hamde hi subhan allah hil azeem bukhari muslim tirmizi you may also use supplications used in the daily salah or you may seek forgiveness of allah and ask him whatever you wish in your own language hatim hatim is a semicircular halfbuilt portion which was originally a part of the kabah but which could not be included in the main structure when the kabah was rebuilt it is obligatory to go around hatim also while performing tawaf rukn yamani and its supplications after passing the three corners of the kabah you reach the fourth corner known as rukn yamani touch it with both hands or with right hand there is a beautiful supplication to be used while walking between rukn yamani and hajareaswad rabbana atina fiddunya hasanatan wa filakhirati hasanatan wa qina azabinnar our beloved prophet peace be upon him has repeatedly recited this supplication the first circuit is complete when you reach hajareaswad seven circuits at hajareaswad start the second circuit by kissing it or pointing towards it as you started the first circuit ie come in front of hajareaswad raise both hands to your ears with open palms towards it and say  bismillahi allahu akbar wa lillah hil hamd now kiss both palms and drop your hands after this go around kabah as you did before and similarly complete the seven circuits the end of tawaf at the end of seven circuits do istilam of hajare aswad or point towards it eighth time which is sunnat muakidah also say bismillahi allahu akbar wa lillah hill hamdiztaba finished  now iztaba is finished therefore you cover your both shoulders with upper portion of the ihram sheet this does not apply to women multazam now come to multazam which is a place five or six feet in length between hajareaswad and the door of kabah this is a highly sacred place where prayers are accepted among a large crowd of people if it is possible to reach multazam cling to it pressing your chest and cheeks and while trembling and crying with devotion and with all humility seek allahs mercy his blessings and ask him whatever you wish if you are unable to come close to multazam just face towards it and supplicate from a distance maqam ibrahim next offer two rakahs of nafls behind and close to maqam ibrahim without coveringyour head if it is zawal time when sajdah is not allowed you have to wait till this undesirable time is passed and then offer prayers in the niyyah intention say that you are offering 2 rakahs of nafls wajib al tawaf recite qul ya ayya hal kafroon in the first rakah and qulhu wallah in the second rakah after this supplicate to allah in arabic or in your own language ask him whatever you wish and invoke his blessings if it is not possible to offer this obligatory prayer near maqam ibrahim it can be offered anywhere in mataf or in hatim or anywhere in masjid alharaam or even at any place in haram of makkah zamzam now go to zamzam well situated in the basement of the haram about 200 feet from the kabahs door there are separate portions for men and women zamzam is the best available water in the world drink this water to fill while in standing position saying bismillah then supplicate to allah allahummah inni asaluka ilman naafian wa rizqan waasian wa shifaam min kulli daain o allah i implore thee for beneficial knowledge for vast provisions and for cure from every disease rules for tawaf of umrahone should be in the state of ihram before starting tawaf there are three conditions essential for tawaf of umrah and for all other kinds of tawaf as well namely to be a muslim niyyah intentionto perform tawaf inside masjid alharaam without niyyah tawaf is not valid tawaf can be performed in mataf or on different floors of masjid alharam or even on its roof while performing tawaf one should not look towards kabah one has to face kabah only when doing istilam of hajareaswad after completing the seven circuits of tawaf if someone deliberately starts the eighth circuit it becomes obligatory wajib for him to complete the second tawaf by doing six more circuits undesirable times for prayer are not considered undesirable for performing tawaf if someone has to discontinue tawaf because of time for prescribed prayer or because a dead body is brought for a funeral prayer or need for fresh ablutions arises he can later resume tawaf at the point where he discontinued a cheklist for obligatory wajib parts of tawaftawaf is finished but here is a checklist to make sure that no obligatory part is missed one should be free from the state of impurity and must have performed vudu ablutions the women are not allowed to perform tawaf during their monthly period and during the impure state after childbirth one should be properly dressed the holy prophet peace be upon him has said nobody should go around the kabah in a naked state bukharito perform tawaf on foot performing tawaf while riding is permissible only when one is unable to do so on foot to start tawaf from ones right side in the counter clockwise direction to complete seven circuits of tawaf during tawaf to pass hatim as well which is in fact a part of the kabah to start tawaf from hajareaswad to offer two rakahs of nafls after each tawaf it is undesirable  makrooh to combine two tawafs together and not to offer two rakahs of nafls in between as tawaf of umrah is performed while in the state of ihram one has to observe all the prohibitions associated with this state saeythe literal meaning of saey is to run or to make effort but as a hajj and umrah term saey denoteswalking back and forth seven times between the hills of safa and marwah which are situated to the south and north of the kabah respectively now there are only signs of these hills and the whole route between them is enclosed in a long gallery saey has a historical background prophet abraham left his wife hazrat hajra and infant son hazrat ismael in the wilderness of makkah at the command of allah the mother and son lived for five days on the food and water they had when the water was completely finished the mother ran frantically seven times between the hills of safa and marwah insearch of water for her son suddenly the fountain of zamzam oozed miraculously near the feet of hazrat ismael saey is included in the rites of hajj and umrah to commemorate this event of search and struggle rules for saeysaey is obligatory wajib after the conclusion of the tawaf and not before it to be free from impurity is not obligatory wajib for saey therefore women during their monthly period can perform saey although they are not allowed to enter masjid alharaam offer salat or perform tawaf they can enter the place of saey from the outside entrance but it is a sunnah to be free from all types of impurity and be in the state of ablutions during saey saey has seven trips and all are obligatory wajib but according to maulana khalilurrahman of pakistan the four trips are fard and the remaining three are obligatory wajib just remember all seven trips have to be completed it is a sunnah to start saey right after tawaf but it is not obligatory wajib therefore if saey is delayed for some reason there is no penalty it is obligatory wajib to start saey from the hill of safa and end at marwah it is obligatory to perform saey on foot unless somebody has an excuse when it can be performed by riding during the saey of umrah it is obligatory to be in the state of ihram one should also be in ihram for the saey performed after tawaf of arrival qudum but it is a sunnah to perform the saey after tawaf of visit ziyarah in ordinary clothes saey is performed only once during hajj either after tawaf of arrival qudum or tawaf of visit ziyrah but it is better to perform saey after tawaf of visit it is a sunnah to climb the hills of safa and marwah and raise hands for supplication facing the kabah it is undesirable makrooh to do business during saey but one can talk if the need arises how to perform saeyistilam of hajareaswad before starting saey do istilam of hajareaswad again the ninth time or point towards it saying bismillahi allahu akbar wa lillah hil hamad now proceed towards safa it is a sunnah to be in the state of ablutions during saey start of saey at safa climb the hill of safa and make intention niyyah for saey  o allah i perform saey between safa and marwah to please you make it

towards marwah come down from safa and move towards marwah while reciting this supplication subhanallah walhamdulillahi wa la ilaha illallah waallahu akbar wa la haula wa la quwwata illabilla if you don’t remember this supplication also recite subhan allah alhamdu lillah allahu akbar repeatedly and keep moving you may also praise allah and ask for his mercy in your language or use supplications taken from the daily salah when you reach two green pillars men have to run between them but the women should walk with their normal pace at marwah when on top of marwah praise allah facing the kabah and repeat the same supplications that were recited at safa one trip is over second trip will be on safa and third trip will be on marwah end of saey in the same way the seventh trip will end at

clipping are permissible for men though shaving is preferable women are however allowed to have a lock of their hair clipped they are forbidden to shave their heads umrah is complete after cutting the hair umrah is complete the restrictions of ihram are finished now wear your everyday clothes and lead a normal life be thankful to allah that he provided the opportunity for performing umrah and lead rest of your life according to the commands of your creator nafl tawaf you may perform umrah as often as you want according to the above procedure and if you want to perform just a nafl tawaf follow the same procedure however in a nafl tawaf there is no ihram no ramal no iztaba and even no saey
