trip more coverage fare evaders prompt ticketing change for septaamtraks new ceo brings airline experience to the railroad dude wheres my ride septa invests in realtime data the riders might have to accept a pickup time within two hours of when they would actually like to depart and then may need to be ok with the vehicle showing up 10 minutes early — or 20 minutes late when the parts aren’t moving in sync riders have waited hours for the customized community transportation vehicle to show“for a long time i did use paratransit” said theresa yates 49 whose cerebral palsy requires her to use a wheelchair “i got tired of waiting”in coming weeks septa expects to release the results of a study on how to improve cct service it could look to boston transit officials there are nearing the end of a oneyear pilot program that could reinvent paratransit services since fall 2016 the massachusetts bay transportation authority has subsidized rides on uber and lyft it is a work in progress and there are concerns about providing equal service for everyone who needs it but ridebooking services could create unprecedented mobility and freedom for people now forced to live by the limits of paratransit services said advocates for the elderly and disabled around boston“i really think this has a lot of promise” said elizabeth deanclower a clinical instructor at tufts university school of medicine who herself uses a wheelchair due to multiple sclerosis ms “right now there’s still this inequity for people who require wav wheelchair accessible vehicles to fully participate”public transportation for people with disabilities — more like cab service than mass transit — is difficult and expensive whether it’s here in philadelphia or in boston where user complaints are similar the services require welltrained drivers and smart dispatch accounting for multiple stops and a wide range of physical limitations users describe long waits disrespectful drivers and meandering routes to travel just a few miles the result can be late arrivals missed appointments and an uncertainty about how long it will take to get from here to there in philadelphia these complaints prompted the 150000 consultants’ review septa’s paratransit service provides about 8000 trips a day with 465 vehicles dire finances led to boston’s ridehail pilot the mbta which provides up to 7000 paratransit trips a day in boston and 60 surrounding municipalities had seen paratransit service expenses double from 50 million to 100 million in 10 years said ben schutzman the mbta’s director of transportation innovations the mbta trial was offered to 1200 riders instead of 35 per ride on average the sharing service cost the mbta 9“it became a nobrainer” schutzman said by the end of the year the mbta expects to take steps to permanently add ride hailing as an option for disabled riders doing so schutzman said would bring the authority’s paratransit budget from about 109 million down to 932 million both uber and lyft reported interest in extending their participation a traditional paratransit ride in the boston region runs a minimum of 315 with the fee increasing based on distance under the mbta pilot program passengers pay for the first 2 of the ride on an uber or lyft and up to 13 is covered by the mbta with the passenger paying anything beyond that septa’s base fare is 4 boston paratransit users reported that the ondemand subsidized rides got them where they wanted to go in minutes without a day’s advance planning their main complaint has been there aren’t always enough accessible lyft or uber vehicles available“my biggest fear is to be somewhere and not have the kind of vehicle needed to get back” deanclower said uber has added to its fleet of accessible vehicles since the pilot program began a company spokeswoman said the program also has expanded the search radius for available vehicles waits may be longer but it’s more likely that a vehicle will be available in philadelphia uber met a state requirement of 70 modified vehicles though users have complained that they aren’t always sufficiently accessible for people in wheelchairs access to ridebooking services for people with disabilities even those paying full price has been a concern of the disabled community in both cities a contract between the mbta and ridehailing companies “allows us to exert pressure on uber and lyft to have more accessible vehicles” said bill henning director of the boston center for independent living because uber and lyft are reluctant to share data they consider proprietary the mbta can’t track how often riders can’t find a cab adapted for wheelchairs it is evaluating the success of the program by tracking how many trips are taken through ridehailing compared to traditional paratransit and how quickly requests for rides are filled user surveys give the ridehailing service significantly higher marks than traditional paratransit philadelphia government personnel and septa staff have been watching the mbta program to determine whether it could be emulated here“i think the whole industry is watching what boston’s experience is” said ron hopkins assistant general manager of operations for septa in hearings before city council in february septa officials said they were reluctant to turn to ridehailing companies critics questioned whether unequal access to smart phones and a dearth of wheelchairaccessible vehicles might prevent ride hailing from being a viable alternative to paratransit federal transportation officials also raised the issue of ensuring training for drivers who unlike contracted paratransit drivers are not fulltime employees advocates in the boston area worried the convenience of ride hailing might draw disabled riders who are physically capable of using buses and subways thereby overloading the paratransit system the mbta addressed some of the technological hurdles by setting up ways to hail rides by personal computer or telephone not just by app just 20 percent of all paratransit users require wheelchair accessible vehicles it’s optimistic that there will be enough vehicles in the boston area to serve those riders in the near term septa expects to use the consultants’ report to improve cct hopkins said hopkins expects to have locators on cct vehicles soon allowing riders to track progress in real time septa uses six contractors to provide paratransit service in philadelphia and the four neighboring counties in the city at least a boost to the minimumwage drivers along with penalizing riders who were no shows for cct trips improved ontime rates from around 70 percent to 85 percent the authority expects to also improve the dispatch and reservation process ideally hopkins said septa’s mass transit will be fully accessible to people with physical limitations reducing the number of people who need a specialized service“there’s a lot of effort in our capital program to make our fixed route accessible” he said “if you make it more accessible people will migrate to the subways or the buses”but updates could take years while all the authority’s buses are accessible most trolleys are not on regional rail the norristown high speed line and the two subway lines about half of 228 stops are wheelchair accessible theresa yates often is able to use septa’s buses and subways but has been willing to pay the full rate for an occasional uber for the convenience about 20 percent of the time she has not been able to find a wheelchairaccessible vehicle she said nevertheless she is warming to ride hailing“i still prefer uber over paratransit” she said “they come when they say they are going to come”more coverage meet the man behind the stealth art show under phillys city hall
