income tax plus any additional state taxes indirect benefits benefits that an employee enjoys without paying for them your company takes care of them but add their monetary value to your ctc offcourse it is an expense for the company and hence could be added to ctc here is the most common benefits also called perquisites in legal indian government terms that may form part of your ctc interest free loans if any if your company is providing you interest free loans for buying a car or a house or any other need they are definitely not doing a charity they usually add the monetary value of the interest benefit that you will get out of not paying it to your ctc usually banking companies like icici allow their employees to get car or home loans at highly subsidized rates and then add the amount equal to the difference between the market and subsidized interest rate to employee’s ctc if you don’t take the loan you won’t get this benefit but it is anyway added to your virtual ctc be careful while accepting the offer letter note the differential amount of benefit ie the money you save with subsidized rate of interest is taxable it depends on your company policy if they bear the tax or pass it on to you as an employee food coupons  subsidized meals many mnc employers offer free lunch and evening snacks at workplace do you think these are free no way dig deeper in your ctc letter and you would certainly find them in the list this reminds me of one proverb “no lunch is free in this world” on the other hand the meal vouchers or food coupons help you save income tax too note normally you won’t get this amount inhand even if you optout of eating in their cafeteria this free lunch benefit is mostly noncashable company leased accommodation cla your employer might provide you with company paid rent to the landlord directly saving you from the tension of finding a home and negotiating on rent deals the monetary value of cla is added to your ctc which is normally the rent and furniture cost no prizes for guessing that the benefit is not tax free company leased accommodation is counted as a perquisite and is taxable medical and life insurance premiums paid by company group medical and life insurance policies by your employer give you much better and comprehensive cover over the individual ones but they do come at a cost to your company and it obviously is included in your ctc since the money is still flowing from your pocket even though you never paid it directly you do get some tax benefits you will never be asked to pay premium but in reality you would have paid it as part of the group free cabs for office commute you would be lured to a new job with the option of free transportation to office well it is not free even if it is subsidized most employer’s would add it to your ctc free or subsidized transport is still taxable either as fbt employer pays tax or as your income tax if the employer passes it on to you income tax savings sometimes companies offer you some benefits which are tax free for you but are taxable for them for example if you receive per diem allowances they are subjected to fbt fringe benefit tax it is supposed to paid by your employer and not you some companies do add the value of this tax in your ctc that you as an employee would be liable to pay if your company does not pay it this again forms part of your ctc even though you will never receive this amount in your pocket fbt tax saving added to ctc is a virtual amount that you will never receive in your hand related unspent per diem allowance received abroad are taxable in india office space rent this is the most weird component but a real one you must have heard about fat pay packages that people graduating from iim indian institute of management or iit indian institute of technology receive they run into several lakhs of rupees at the fresher level itself if you carefully look at the breakup of ctc most of them do include the work cubicle rent for example if the company is spending inr 7000 per month on the cubicle that you would sit in at your work location they would add the yearly cost of this in your ctc this simply means that inr 84000 127000 will form part of your pay package even though you will never get ityour work location rent is also part of fat ctc packages saving contributions payments made to your long term savings account by your employer they do not form part of your monthly take home but belong to you and you may or may not get them in long term superannuation benefits a predefined amount is contributed every month in your superannuation account mostly offered by multinational companies as a way of saving for retirement you can withdraw it after you retire or at the time of leaving the organization most of the companies do not directly give you cash on separation though you get an option of converting the amount into some kind of insurance policy employer provident fund contribution your employer contributes about 12 of basic salary every month to your provident fund account as per the indian income tax law employer is only bound to pay 12 the atleast inr 15000 fit he real basic is more than this amount most of them in real world do contribute the 12 of real basic though this is primarily the reason that employers try to keep the basic salary amount as low as possible this amount keeps accumulating in your pf account and you can withdraw it as cash at the time of leaving the company check out the difference between employer pf employee pf called vpf and ppf for clarity employer pf is part of ctc but does not show up on your salary slip if it not counted as part of your earnings and hence is not taxed gratuity it is paid at the rate of 481 of total yearly basic salary per year as per indian tax law with a time limit of 5 years attached to it if you leave the organization anytime before 5 years you cannot claim your gratuity accumulation you lose it make sure you serve a company for at least 5 years to enjoy your gratuity cost to company india – how does it differ from take home salary difference between in hand salary and ctc you would have seen this many times that even if your ctc package ctc is 6 lakhs per annum and hence monthly income inr 50000 you only receive about inr 4042000 as your monthly take home pay this is because ctc is actually a sum total of various components as mentioned above and not all of them are given to you on monthly basis in your hand some of them like gratuity employer provident fund and superannuation benefits are added to your long term savings account but do not form part of monthly take home pay the other reason of reduced takehome pay is the income tax that is deducted at source called tds itself ie by your employer how to understand ctc to find take home pay for job you should evaluate your ctc or package carefully and make sure that you understand each and every element correctly use take home salary calculator – india to make a decision of accepting the new job offer or not do not just look at the figure of ctc as there could many components which may be misleading and may not form part of your monthly take
