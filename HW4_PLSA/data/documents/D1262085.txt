the national civil rights museum on the site of the former lorraine motel this is where dr martin luther king jr was assassinated in 1968 the exhibits here are poignant and extremely welldesigned its especially important for young people to see and understand the stories presented here a lesserknown but fascinating attraction is a fiveblocklong scale model of the lower mississippi river on display at mud island river park which can be reached by tram from the riverfront the deep detail shows every turn in the river from cairo ill to new orleans anyone with a love of travel or geography will enjoy this attraction in downtown memphis you find beale street which bills itself as the home of blues and the birthplace of rock n roll there are more than two dozen places to enjoy memphis barbecue or live music moneysaving tips the 4375 ticket at graceland is a better value than the 3875 ticket by the time youre confronted with this choice youve already spent money to get to graceland and for parking the 75 vip ticket is not a budget choice the extra few dollars for the upgrade is reasonable given that the revenues maintain exhibits you can only see at graceland order your tickets in advance although theres a small fee online orders could save you long waits in line pick up tickets at willcall layover visitors beware unless you have a minimum of three hours layover time its probably not wise to attempt a visit it has been done in less than three hours but traffic can be intense and lines at graceland are long at many times of the day security lines at mem are not usually lengthy but can become busy when travelers on business or holiday trips show up at the airport visit with realistic expectations this is not the most elegant mansion you will ever see nor is it the largest in fact youll be struck by the relative simplicity of elvis life given his status as a world celebrity parts of it are tacky check out the jungle room a place furnished with outlandish carpeting furniture and kitsch but some are touching as well the simple swing set he set up for his daughter lisa marie in the back yard is one example everything here was left largely the way it looked at the time of elvis death in 1977 combine graceland with other memphis attractions big elvis fans will come here just for graceland but for most people it is a halfday adventure at best so look at some of the other attractions in the area listed above are a few suggestions and make your trip to the city memorable avoid the crowds if youre interested in less stress and more value go on a
