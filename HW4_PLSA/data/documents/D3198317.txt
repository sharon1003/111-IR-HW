the ideal mortgage amount is 1 million dollars if you can afford itposted by financial samurai 93 comments the ideal mortgage amount is 1000000 if you can afford it back in 2002 a 1 million mortgage cost around 50000 to 65000 a year in interest expense given mortgage rates were 565 for a 51 arm or a 30year fixed multiply the annual interest expense by three and you get 150000195000 the minimum annual income recommended to take out such a loan in 2018 a 1 million mortgage costs around 30000 to 4000 a year in interest expense given mortgage rates are now 3 for a 51 arm or 4 for a 30year fixed multiply the annual interest expense by three again and you get 90000 to 120000 a far cry from the 150000195000 you originally needed to make you just need to come up with the 20 downpayment which is one of the main struggles for first time home buyers today note banks still only lend out 34x your income despite a drop in rates it is aggressive to think that someone who only makes 90000 – 120000 a year in gross salary can afford a 1 million mortgage but it’s also absurd that one can borrow 1 million dollars nowadays for only 3 i’m not recommending everyone with impeccable credit scores great financial habits and steady savings rates all get 1 million mortgages i’m just saying that it’s now possible for someone making 90000 – 12000 a year to service 1 million worth of debt at today’s rate if the bank approves reasons why the ideal mortgage about is 1 million1 the law says so the maximum mortgage interest indebtedness is 1 million dollars according to the irs in other words if you have a 2 million dollar mortgage that costs 70000 a year in mortgage interest only 35000 of the mortgage interest can be deducted from your income your tax savings is simply 35000 x tax rate the irs also stipulates that you can deduct the interest on a 100000 home equity line of credit if the money is used other than to build improve or purchase your home crazy but true2 maximum government subsidy the home mortgage interest deduction is one of the largest government subsidies available to all citizens in an environment when all it seems like the government does is take take take citizens get something tangible and immediate back from the government the government helps subsidize your lifestyle and lower your taxes to not take full advantage of such subsidy is a shame unless you love paying taxes3 keeps you disciplined for those who live in expensive cities such as san francisco and nyc keeping a 1 million dollar mortgage limit helps keep you from going overboard and buying too much house plenty of nice houses now cost over 2 million dollars for example by keeping your borrowing to 1 million you are forced to come up with a 1 million down payment before you can buy such house you might think going the standard 20 down 400000 and borrowing 16 million is fine but it is not ideal you start justifying what’s an extra 600000 in debt at that price losing your financial discipline i can assure you that everything because more painful the more you borrow less deductions higher mortgage payment and more stress this is why investing in completely passive real estate crowdfunding investments has gained so much popularity recently now investors can access property all over the country much more efficiently4 asymmetric risk and reward in america when you borrow a ton of money from a bank and can’t pay it back one day you don’t get stoned to death castrated or impaled in the heart by a spear instead you hand back the keys to the bank who agreed to take on your home as collateral in case of non payment if you are lucky to live in a nonrecourse state the bank can’t go after your other assets if you live in a recourse state then a shortsale or foreclosure will temporarily slaughter your credit score for 37 years better your credit score then your private parts right meanwhile if you happen to invest in the right cycle you can make a massive amount of money when you finally sell or rent the property out without having to give the bank any of the upside isn’t america great5 you make closer to the ideal income how much mortgage interest you can fully deduct is based on how much money you make make too much and your mortgage interest deductions get phased out make too little which is under 79500 based on existing rates and you will feel the strain of the mortgage payments if you or your household make between 200000300000 you are in the sweet spot to take on a 1 million dollar mortgage be aware if have an adjusted gross income of over 166800 your mortgage interest starts to get phased out for every 100 of income over 166800 you lose 3 of itemized deduction x 333 up to a maximum loss of 80 percent of your itemized deductions lower rates have moved everybody closer to the ideal incomemortgage amounts differ for everyone if you live parts of the country which have wonderful 500000 homes then awesome there is never a need to borrow 1 million dollars the standard deduction of 6350 for singles and 12700 for married couples for 2017 is probably good enough for most for those of you who live in expensive coastal cities then consider 1 million dollars as the cap on how much you should borrow to purchase your primary residence once done consider taking advantage of investing in lower cost areas of the country through real estate
