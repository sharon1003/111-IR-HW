when you decide to prospect for diamonds learn to recognize diamond and then watch your gold pan to see if you trap any of these gems diamond has a specific gravity of 35 and will concentrate with black sands in a gold pan so when you are panning and you see a transparent to white crystal or even better  apink or blue crystal in your pan in the middle of the black sands with distinct greasy luster take it out and look it over closely with your hand lens magnifying lens it should look as if it has a thin coating of grease on the surface now get out your diamond detector and test the crystal diamonds have unique surface conductivity which is why they feel cool to the touch of your lips ice and can be detected by a diamond detector all you have to do is switch on your diamond detector and touch the suspected diamond with the probe if it reads diamond be sure to send it to me as a gift if it reads simulate it is something other than diamond and dont bother sending it diamond detectors are so easy to operate that with some effort you can even teach a monkey and rarely a politician how to use them to aid in your expertise in diamond hunting buy a few very cheap uncut rough diamonds to have in your personal collection for comparison and to assist in your mineralogy education without mineralogical training or a diamond tester you probably will not be 100 positive as to you have so take your crystal to a pawn shop and ask for 1 million  the pawn broker will most likely be able to tell you if you are crazy or if you have something of value but also remember rough diamonds are not worth much unless you have a large one 10 or more carats remember those bozos on gold rush in south america when all they could find were diamonds  it took some time but i suspect they finally caught on  small rough diamonds just dont have much value  if you have a goodquality rough gem diamond of about 1 carat  you may be able to get us100 or 200 for it if it is industrial diamond you might be able to get enough to by one can of soup faceted diamonds attached to a gold necklace in a jewelry store do have value and big gemquality diamonds of a few hundred carats can be traded for a good field vehicle  such as a 4wheel drive porsche with monster tires now examine photos of raw diamonds and check my sites on diamonds  i have a few of them scattered all over the internet now search the internet for photos of rough diamonds l ook at the crystal shape of the mineral in question  most diamonds look equaldimensional a few will not and are isometric look for trigons on the crystal surface now this is very important dont let your imagination run wild ive had hundreds of people report they see trigons little triangles on the crystal surface when there was nothing there not sure what they were smoking but it should be easy to tell if you have triangles on a crystal surface or not the crystal habit can also be helpful many rough diamonds occur as octahedrons  crystals that look like two pyramids attached at their base  8sided crystals but again hold on  dont run out a buy a new car yet unless you plan to send it to me there are many other minerals that form octahedrons so this in not diagnostic another common crystal habit is a macle  looks kind of like a flattened triangle then there are cubes  those 6sided crystals that look like dice b ut then there are many modifications of these crystal habits many placer diamonds have been found in california and colorado in the past and other diamonds have been identified in many states across the nation it is likely hundreds of rough diamonds were also discarded by gold prospectors not knowing what diamonds looked like and others likely are in private rock hound collections waiting for someone to discover the gemstone to begin a search for diamonds focus on kimberlites in cratons cratons are very old continental cores in the past 2009 i published two articles for prospectors on how to use a personal computer to find cryptovolcanic structures i recommend reading these articles as they will give you an advantage over other prospectors first start searching areas where kimberlites have already been reported because kimberlites often occur in clusters as you begin your search start identifying known kimberlites and pinning them on google earth to provide you with a visual reference now start looking for alignments  lineaments of kimberlites as kimberlites also occur along deepseated fractures when you identify a fracture lineament with a kimberlite along the fracture  project that fracture out a few miles and look for evidence of other kimberlites along trend as an example search for the sloan 5 kimberlite in colorado on google earth at the following coordinates 40°52617n 105°265254w here is a roughly elliptical open park free of trees that is about 012 miles across in a northsouth direction and maybe 006 mile in the eastwest direction this park marks the kimberlite pipe the fact that it is elongated in the northsouth direction suggests this could be the location of its primary fracture as you look in this area you will likely see other lineaments and open parks all worth exploring now lets look at the indian guide district in wyoming west of chugwater i found these anomalies many years ago but these remain unexplored and unsampled are they just ponds or are they kimberlites check the indian guide photo in the gallery above this is a falsecolor infrared image over indian guide showing a group of depressions some which have small ponds water shows up as black in this image all of these are structurally controlled note all of the lines lineaments that project through the various depressions note that a couple of ponds also have white rings kind of like the bathtub rings we use to leave as kids for our mothers to clean up on the ground these react to weak 10 hydrochloric acid there is no known source for calcium carbonate in these precambrian rocks that we know of so these may be kimberlites if you were to visit these on the ground you would want to look for rounded bounders and cobbles in the depressions characteristic of kimberlite and look for blue ground clays with considerable calcium carbonate as well as look for the kimberlitic indicator minerals and even diamonds so how many kimberlites or cryptovolcanic depressions can you find in this one photo at least 25 keep in mind that when blue ground and yellow ground kimberlite was first discovered in the kimberly region of south africa people though they were finding diamonds in an old paleoplacer because it contained many rounded boulders cobbles and pebbles however instead of being rounded by stream action these were rounded by magma polishing as the material was carried to the surface in the kimberlite magma the kimberlite host rock was later identified as the early diamond prospectors dug deeper into the yellow ground then blue ground and finally the kimberlite next learn to recognize the classical kimberlitic indicator minerals as these have been found in many places in colorado montana and wyoming and even in places like kansas california and michigan you can search for kimberlitic indicator minerals by panning streams or in the questionable crypto volcanic depression when you find kimberlitic indicator minerals in streams it is assumed they originated from a short distance either upslope or upstream for example chromian diopside will only transport 025 to 05 miles from a source kimberlite pyrope garnet may transport 1 to 2 miles from the kimberlite and picroilmenite only 15 to 3 miles from the kimberlite several years ago we conducted a stream sediment sample survey in southeastern wyoming searching for the kimberlitic indicator minerals by panning various streams and we identified more than 300 anomalies the source of most of those anomalies remains unknown over years of looking for kimberlite and lamproite i was amazed at how people overlook these rocks and many gemstones on one field trip i led a group of 50 geologists  prospectors to the chicken park kimberlites in colorado i told the group i would walk them over kimberlites and they were to watch and let me know when they saw kimberlite i walked them over kimberlite a few times and not one person saw them until i took them back to show them what they had missed and the chicken park kimberlites are some of the more obvious kimberlites in the area so you as a prospector have an opportunity to find a major diamond deposit heres how to find the obvious pipes fly your google earth or virtual earth to the kimberly region of south africa look for some diamond mines  now look in the areas surrounding the diamond mines i found several probable kimberlites in this area do the same for the nw territories of canada search the ekati mine the ekati has about 120 kimberites in the area surrounding the mine most are under shallow lakes
