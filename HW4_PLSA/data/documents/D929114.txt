although that is difficult to do right now i know her final wish would be that we return to laughing soon slideshow celebrity deaths 2014under the immobile plastic surgerycrafted veneer that became joan rivers unapologetic trademark as she aged her wit remained as vibrantly raw and unruly as when she first broke her way into a comedy world belonging largely to men in a 2010 late show interview david letterman broached the plastic surgery issue you dont look exactly like the joan rivers i used to know rivers was unapologetic our business is so youthful  you do little tweaks and i think if a woman wants to look good or a man do it she said its not about anybody else fashion and acting were the early dreams of the woman who grew up as a selfdescribed fatty but it was humor that paid the bills and ultimately made rivers a star she refused to cede the spotlight as the decades passed working vigorously until her death i have never wanted to be a day less than i am she said in a 2013 interview with the associated press people say i wish i were 30 again nahhh im very happy here its great it gets better and better and then of course we die she quipped rivers was a scrapper rebuilding her career and life after a failed attempt to make it as a latenight host was followed closely by her husbands suicide rivers style was harddriving from the start and her material only got sharper she was ready to slam anyone a favored target was elizabeth taylors weight her favorite food is seconds but the comedian kept current with verbal assaults on miley cyrus and other newcomers with her raspy voice and brash new york accent rivers turned the red carpet of the oscars emmys and golden globes into a stalking ground for e entertainment her familiar query — who are you wearing — would quickly give way to such snarky commentary as her assessment of adeles grammy outfit the singer looked like she was sitting on a teapot the barbs could turn inward as well with rivers mocking everything from her proclaimed lack of sex appeal my best birth control now is just to leave the lights on to her own mortality in 2007 rivers and her partnerinslime daughter melissa were dropped by their new employer the tv guide channel and replaced by actress lisa rinna but the rivers women found new success on e with fashion police which rivers hosted and her daughter produced joan rivers never relaxed always looking for the next and better punchline the trouble with me is i make jokes too often she told the ap in 2013 just days after the death of her older sister i was making jokes yesterday at the funeral home thats how i get through life life is so difficult — everybodys been through something but you laugh at it it becomes smaller she had faced true crisis in the mid1980s edgar rosenberg her husband of 23 years committed suicide in 1987 after she was fired from her fox talk show which he produced the shows failure was a major factor rivers said rosenbergs suicide also temporarily derailed her career nobody wants to see someone whose husband has killed himself do comedy four weeks later she told the new york times in 1990 rivers had originally entered show business with the dream of being an actress but comedy was a way to pay the bills while she auditioned for dramatic roles somebody said you can make six dollars standing up in a club she told the ap and i said here i go it was better than typing all day in the early 1960s comedy was a mans game and the only women comics she could look to were totie fields and phyllis diller but she worked her way up from local clubs in new york until in 1965 she landed her big break on the tonight show after numerous rejections god youre funny youre going to be a star host johnny carson told her after she had rocked the audience with laughter her nightclub career prospered and by late that year she had recorded her first comedy album joan rivers presents mr phyllis and other funny stories her personal life picked up as well she met british producer rosenberg and they married after a fourday courtship rivers hosted a morning talk show on nbc in 1968 and the next year made her las vegas debut with female comedians still a relative rarity to control an audience is a very masculine thing rivers told the los angeles times in 1977 the minute a lady is in any form of power they the public totally strip away your femininity — which isnt so catherine the great had a great time in 1978 she wrote directed and costarred in the movie rabbit test it had an intriguing premise — billy crystal as a man who gets pregnant — but was poorly received in 1983 though she scored a coup when she was named permanent guest host for carson on tonight although she drew good ratings nbc hesitated in renewing her contract three years later fledgling network fox jumped in with an offer of her own latenight show she launched the late show starring joan rivers on fox in 1986 but the venture lasted just a season and came at a heavy price carson cut ties with her when she surprised him by becoming a competitor carson kept publicly silent about her defection but referred obliquely to his new rival in his monologue on the day her show debuted there are a lot of big confrontations this week carson said as the audience giggled expectantly reagan and gorbachev the mets versus the astros and me versus the
