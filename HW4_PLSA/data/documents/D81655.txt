septic systems are a very simple way to treat household wastewater and are easy to operate and maintain as a homeowner you must take an active role in maintaining your septic system once you have learned how a system works it is easier to appreciate the importance of a few sound operation and maintenance practices how septic systems work there are two main parts to the basic septic system the septic tank and the drainfield the septic tank household wastewater first flows into the septic tank where it should stay for at least a day in the tank heavy solids in the wastewater settle to the bottom forming a layer of sludge while grease and light solids float to the top forming a layer of scum the sludge and scum remain in the tank where naturally occurring bacteria work to break them down the bacteria cannot completely break down all of the sludge and scum however and this is why septic tanks need to be pumped periodically the separated wastewater in the middle layer of the tank is pushed out into the drainfield as more wastewater enters the septic tank from the house if too much water is flushed into the septic tank in a short period of time the wastewater flows out of the tank before it has had time to separate this can happen on days when water use is unusually high laundry day for example or more often if the septic tank is too small for the needs of the household back to top the drainfield when wastewater leaves a septic tank too soon solids can be carried with it to the drainfield drainfields provide additional treatment for the wastewater by allowing it to trickle from a series of perforated pipes through a layer of gravel and down through the soil the soil acts as a natural filter and contains organisms that help treat the waste solids damage the drainfield by clogging the small holes in the drainfield pipes and the surrounding gravel then excess water will strain the system unnecessarily back to top how to care for your system septic system maintenance is often compared to automobile maintenance because only a little effort on a regular basis can save a lot of money and significantly prolong the life of the system sound septic system operation and maintenance practices includes these 3 simple rules conserving water being careful that nothing harmful is disposed of through the system and having the system inspected regularly and pumped periodically every 35 years it is important to educate everyone in your household about what is and what isnt good for septic systems so they can begin to develop good maintenance habits back to top1 use water wisely water conservation is very important for septic systems because continual saturation of the soil in the drainfield can affect the quality of the soil and its ability to naturally remove toxins bacteria viruses and other pollutants from the wastewater the first thing you can do is take stock of how water is being used or wasted around the house here are some examples of things you can do to conserve water if you have any leaking faucets or running toilets repair them immediately install watersaving features in faucets and shower heads these devices can reduce water use by up to 50 percentavoid taking long showers or letting water run while washing hands  brushing teeth use washing machines and dish washers only when full install lowflush toilets lowflush toilets use one to two gallons per flush compared to the three to five gallons used by conventional toilets even using a toilet dam or putting a container filled with rocks in the toilet tank can reduce water use by 25 percent it is also important to avoid overtaxing your system by using a lot of water in a short time period or by allowing too much outside water to reach the drainfield try to space out activities requiring heavy water use like laundry over several days finally divert roof drains surface water and sump pumps away from the drainfield back to top2 know what not to flush what you put into your septic system greatly affects its ability to do its job as a general rule of thumb do not dispose of anything in your septic system that can just as easily be put in the trash remember that your system is not designed to be a garbage disposal and that solids build up in the septic tank and eventually need to be pumped out in the kitchen avoid washing food scraps coffee grinds and other food items down the drain grease and cooking oils contribute to the layer of scum in the tank and also should not be put down the drain garbage disposals can increase the amount of solids in the tank up to 50 percent and are not recommended for use with septic systems the same commonsense approach used in the kitchen should be used in the bathroom dont use the toilet to dispose of plastics paper towels tampons disposable diapers bathroom towelettes handy wipes oily floor cleaners liquid fabric softener water softener backwash condoms kitty litter etc the only things that should be flushed down the toilet are wastewater and toilet paper avoid hazardous chemicals to avoid disrupting or permanently damaging your septic system do not use it to dispose of hazardous household chemicals even small amounts of paints varnishes thinners waste oil photographic solutions pesticides and other organic chemicals can destroy helpful bacteria and the biological digestion taking place within your system these chemicals also pollute the groundwater household cleaners such as bleach disinfectants and drain and toilet bowl cleaners should be used in moderation and only in accordance with product labels overuse of these products can harm your system it makes sense to try to keep all toxic and hazardous chemicals out of your septic tank system when possible to avoid groundwater pollution be sure to dispose of leftover hazardous chemicals by taking them to an approved hazardous waste collection center for locations and more information contact your local health department back to top3 maintenance some septic system additives that claim to help or clean your system also contain hazardous chemicals and should be avoided do not use caustic drain openers or commercial cleaners call a professional to clear any drain clogs help maintain proper drainage flow by calling ab septic to have your septic tank pumpedout or inspected every 35 years back to top protect your system finally it is important to protect your septic system from potential damage dont plant anything but grass near your septic system roots from shrubs and trees cause damage dont allow anyone to drive or operate heavy machinery over any part of the system and keep livestock away from the drainfield and the other parts of the system also dont build anything on or over the drainfield back to top
