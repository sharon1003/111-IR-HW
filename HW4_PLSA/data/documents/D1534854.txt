corporation detroit michigan november 1942in materials science quenching is the rapid cooling of a workpiece in water oil or air to obtain certain material properties a type of heat treating quenching prevents undesired lowtemperature processes such as phase transformations from occurring it does this by reducing the window of time during which these undesired reactions are both thermodynamically favorable and kinetically accessible for instance quenching can reduce the crystal grain size of both metallic and plastic materials increasing their hardness in metallurgy quenching is most commonly used to harden steel by introducing martensite in which case the steel must be rapidly cooled through its eutectoid point the temperature at which austenite becomes unstable in steel alloyed with metals such as nickel and manganese the eutectoid temperature becomes much lower but the kinetic barriers to phase transformation remain the same this allows quenching to start at a lower temperature making the process much easier high speed steel also has added tungsten which serves to raise kinetic barriers and give the illusion that the material has been cooled more rapidly than it really has even cooling such alloys slowly in air has most of the desired effects of quenching extremely rapid cooling can prevent the formation of all crystal structure resulting in amorphous metal or metallic glass contents  hide 1 quench hardening11 purpose12 process2 history3 see also4 references quench hardening  editquench hardening is a mechanical process in which steel and cast iron alloys are strengthened and hardened these metals consist of ferrous metals and alloys this is done by heating the material to a certain temperature depending on the material this produces a harder material by either surface hardening or throughhardening varying on the rate at which the material is cooled the material is then often tempered to reduce the brittleness that may increase from the quench hardening process items that may be quenched include gears shafts and wear blocks purpose  editbefore hardening cast steels and iron are of a uniform and lammelar or layered pearlitic grain structure this is a mixture of ferrite and cementite formed when steel or cast iron are manufactured and cooled at a slow rate pearlite is not an ideal material for many common applications of steel alloys as it is quite soft by heating pearlite past its eutectoid transition temperature of 727 °c and then rapidly cooling some of the material’s crystal structure can be transformed into a much harder structure known as martensite steels with this martensitic structure are often used in applications when the workpiece must be highly resistant to deformation such as the cutting edge of blades this is very efficient process  editthe process of quenching is a progression beginning with heating the sample most materials are heated to between 815 and 900 °c 1500 to 1650 °f with careful attention paid to keeping temperatures throughout the workpiece uniform minimizing uneven heating and overheating is key to imparting desired material properties the second step in the quenching process is soaking workpieces can be soaked in air air furnace a liquid bath or a vacuum the recommended time allocation in salt or lead baths is up to 6 minutes soaking times can range a little higher within a vacuum as in the heating step it is important that the temperature throughout the sample remains as uniform as possible during soaking once the workpiece has finished soaking it moves on to the cooling step during this step the part is submerged into some kind of quenching fluid different quenching fluids can have a significant effect on the final characteristics of a quenched part water is one of the most efficient quenching media where maximum hardness is desired but there is a small chance that it may cause distortion and tiny cracking when hardness can be sacrificed mineral oils are often used these oil based fluids often oxidize and form a sludge during quenching which consequently lowers the efficiency of the process the quenching velocity cooling rate of oil is much less than water intermediate rates between water and oil can be obtained with a purpose formulated quenchant a substance with an inverse solubility which therefore deposits on the object to slow the rate of cooling quenching can also be accomplished using inert gases such as nitrogen and noble gasses nitrogen is commonly used at greater than atmospheric pressure ranging up to 20 bar absolute helium is also used because its thermal capacity is greater than nitrogen alternatively argon can be used however its density requires significantly more energy to move and its thermal capacity is less than the alternatives to minimize distortion in the workpiece long cylindrical workpieces are quenched vertically flat work pieces are quenched on edge and thick sections should enter the bath first to prevent steam bubbles the bath is agitated often after quenching an iron or steel alloy will be excessively hard and brittle due to an overabundance of martensite in these cases another heat treatment technique known as tempering is performed on the quenched material in order to increase the toughness of iron based alloys tempering is usually performed after hardening to reduce some of the excess hardness and is done by heating the metal to some temperature below the critical point for a certain period of time then allowing it to cool in still air history  editalthough there is evidence of the use of quenching processes by blacksmiths stretching back into the middle of the iron age little detailed information exists related to the development of these techniques and the procedures employed by early smiths 1 although early ironworkers must swiftly have noticed that processes of cooling could affect the strength and brittleness of iron and it can be claimed that heattreatment of steel was known in the old world from the late second millennium bc 2 it is hard to identify deliberate uses of quenching archaeologically moreover it appears that at least in europe quenching and tempering separately do not seem to have become common until the 15th century it is therefore helpful to distinguish between full quenching of steel where the quenching is so rapid that only martensite forms and slack quenching where the quenching is slower or interrupted which also allows pearlite to form and results in a less brittle product 3the earliest examples of quenched steel may come from ancient mesopotamia with a relatively secure example of a fourthcentury bc quenchhardened chisel from al mina in turkey 4 book 9 lines 38994 of homer’s odyssey is widely cited as an early possibly the first written reference to quenching 1 5as when a man who works as a blacksmith plunges a screaming great axe blade or adze into cold water treating it for temper since this is the way steel is made strong even so cyclops eye sizzled about the beam of the olive however it is not beyond doubt that the passage describes deliberate quenchhardening rather than simply cooling 6 likewise there is a prospect that the mahabharata refers to the oilquenching of iron arrowheads but the evidence is problematic 7pliny the elder addressed the topic of quenchants distinguishing the water of different rivers 8 chapters 1821 of the twelfthcentury de diversis artis by theophilus presbyter mentions quenching recommending amongst other things that tools are also given a harder tempering in the urine of a small redheaded boy than in ordinary water 1 one of the fuller early discussions of quenching is the first western printed book on metallurgy von stahel und eysen published in 1532 which is characteristic of latemedieval technical treatises modern scientific study of quenching began to gain real momentum from the seventeenth century with a major step being the observationled discussion by giambattista
