sperm to enter depoprovera and lunelle also cause the lining of the uterus to become thinner makingimplantation of a fertilized egg unlikely an injection of depoprovera or lunelle must be given within the first five days of a normal period depoprovera provides protection against pregnancy for three months while lunelle providessimilar protection for one month ovulation release of a mature egg typically occurs within 60 days of the last injection of lunelle about twice as fast after use of depoprovera also because lunelle is a combined hormone contraceptive as opposed to progestinonly depoprovera and norplant it is less likely to cause irregular or absent menstruation norplant capsules contain a synthetic hormone that is slowly released over a period of up to fiveyears it functions like depoprovera in that it prevents the ovaries from producing ova eggs andalso results in thicker mucus in the cervix which prevents the sperm from passing through thecervix norplant can be inserted
