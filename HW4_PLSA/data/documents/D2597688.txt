gulf in the aegean sea it cuts through the narrow isthmus of corinth and separates the peloponnese from the greek mainland arguably making the peninsula an island the builders dug the canal through the isthmus at sea level no locks are employed it is 64 kilometres 4 mi in length and only 214 metres 70 ft wide at its base making it impassable for most modern ships it now has little economic importance the canal was initially proposed in classical times and a failed effort was made to build it in the 1st century ce 2 construction started in 1881 but was hampered by geological and financial problems that bankrupted the original builders it was completed in 1893 but due to the canals narrowness navigational problems and periodic closures to repair landslides from its steep walls it failed to attract the level of traffic expected by its operators the canal is now used mainly for tourist traffic contents  hide 1 history11 ancient attempts12 construction of the modern canal2 layout3 see also4 references5 external links history  editthe location of the isthmus of corinth the modern canal is shown in light blue ancient attempts  editseveral rulers of antiquity dreamed of digging a cutting through the isthmus the first to propose such an undertaking was the tyrant periander in the 7th century bc the project was abandoned and periander instead constructed a simpler and less costly overland portage road named the diolkos or stone carriageway along which ships could be towed from one side of the isthmus to the other 3 4 5 6 7 perianders change of heart is attributed variously to the great expense of the project a lack of labour or a fear that a canal would have robbed corinth of its dominant role as an entrepôt for goods 8 remnants of the diolkos still exist next to the modern canal 8 9 10the diadoch demetrius poliorcetes 336–283 bc planned to construct a canal as a means to improve his communication lines but dropped the plan after his surveyors miscalculating the levels of the adjacent seas feared heavy floods 8 11the philosopher apollonius of tyana prophesied that anyone who proposed to dig a corinthian canal would be met with illness three roman rulers considered the idea but all suffered violent deaths the historian suetonius writes that the roman dictator julius caesar considered digging a canal through the isthmus but was assassinated before he could begin the project 12 caligula the third roman emperor commissioned a study in 40 ce from egyptian experts who claimed incorrectly that the corinthian gulf was higher than the saronic gulf as a result they concluded if a canal were dug the island of aegina would be inundated caligulas interest in the idea got no further as he too was assassinated before making any progress 13remains of nero s canal project in 1881the emperor nero was the first to attempt to construct the canal personally breaking the ground with a pickaxe and removing the first basketload of soil in 67 ce 2 but the project was abandoned when he died shortly afterwards the roman workforce consisting of 6000 jewish prisoners of war started digging 40–50metrewide 130–160 ft trenches from both sides while a third group at the ridge drilled deep shafts for probing the quality of the rock which were reused in 1881 for the same purpose 11 according to suetonius the canal was dug to a distance of four stades  approximately 700 metres 2300 ft  or about a tenth of the total distance across the isthmus a memorial of the attempt in the form of a relief of hercules was left by neros workers and can still be seen in the canal cutting today 14 other than this as the modern canal follows the same course as neros no remains have survived 8the greek philosopher and roman senator herodes atticus is known to have considered digging a canal in the 2nd century ce but did not get a project under way 15 the venetians also considered it in 1687 after their conquest of the peloponnese but likewise did not initiate a project 16construction of the modern canal  editthe idea of a canal was revived after greece gained formal independence from the ottoman empire in 1830 the greek statesman ioannis kapodistrias asked a french engineer to assess the feasibility of the project but had to abandon it when its cost was assessed at 40 million gold francs —far too expensive for the newly independent country fresh impetus was given by the opening of the suez canal in 1869 and the following year the government of prime minister thrasyvoulos zaimis passed a law authorizing the construction of a corinth canal french entrepreneurs were put in charge but following the bankruptcy of the french company that dug the panama canal french banks refused to lend money and the company went bankrupt as well a fresh concession was granted to the société internationale du canal maritime de corinthe in 1881 which was commissioned to construct the canal and operate it for the next 99 years construction was formally inaugurated on 23 april 1882 in the presence of king george i of greece 17share of the company canal maritime de corinthe issued 1882the companys initial capital was 30000000 francs but after eight years of work it ran out of money and a bid to issue 60000 bonds of 500 francs each flopped when less than half of the bonds were sold the companys head the hungarian istván türr went bankrupt as did the company itself and a bank that had agreed to raise additional funds for the project 18 construction resumed in 1890 when the project was transferred to a greek company and was completed on 25 july 1893 after eleven years work 17the inauguration of the corinth canal 1893 by konstantinos volanakis the canal experienced financial and operational difficulties after completion the narrowness of the canal makes navigation difficult its high rock walls channel high winds down its length and the different times of the tides in the two gulfs cause strong tidal currents in the channel for these reasons many ship operators did not bother to use the canal and traffic was far below what had been predicted an annual traffic of just under 4 million net tons had been anticipated but by 1906 traffic had reached only half a million net tons annually by 1913 the total had risen to 15 million net tons but the disruption caused by the first world war resulted in a major decline in traffic 18the corinth canal seen from the air showing the steep limestone walls which proved vulnerable to landslides another persistent problem was due to the heavily faulted nature of the sedimentary rock in an active seismic zone through which the canal is cut 19 the canals high limestone walls have been persistently unstable from the start although it was formally opened in july 1893 it was not opened to navigation until the following november due to landslides it was soon found that the wake from ships passing through the canal undermined the walls causing further landslides this required further expense in building retaining walls along the waters edge for more than half of the length of the canal using 165000 cubic metres of masonry 20 between 1893 and 1940 it was closed for a total of four years for maintenance to stabilise the walls in 1923 alone 41000 cubic metres of material fell into the canal which took two years to clear out 21serious damage was caused to the canal during world war ii on 26 april 1941 during the battle of greece between defending british troops and the invading forces of nazi germany german parachutists and glider troops attempted to capture the main bridge over the canal the bridge was defended by the british and had been wired for demolition the germans surprised the defenders with a gliderborne assault in the early morning of 26 april and captured the bridge but the british set off the charges and destroyed the structure 22 other authors maintain that german pioneers cut the detonation wires and a lucky hit by british artillery triggered the explosion 23 24three years later as german forces retreated from greece the canal was put out of action by german  scorched earth  operations german forces used explosives to set off landslides to block the canal destroyed the bridges and dumped locomotives bridge wreckage and other infrastructure into the canal to hinder repair work the united states army corps of engineers began work to clear the canal in november 1947 and reopened it for shallowdraft traffic by 7 july 1948 and for all traffic by that september 25layout  editaerial photograph of the corinth canal area 2011the canal consists of a single channel 8 metres 26 ft deep excavated at sea level thus requiring no locks  measuring 6343 metres 20810 ft long by 246 metres 81 ft wide at the top and 213 metres 70 ft wide at the bottom the rock walls which rise 90 metres 300 ft above sea level are at a nearvertical 80° angle 26 27 the canal is crossed by a railway line a road and a motorway at a height of about 45 metres 148 ft in 1988 submersible bridges were installed at sea level at each end of the canal by the eastern harbour of isthmia and the western harbour of poseidonia 28although the canal saves the 700kilometre 430 mi journey around the peloponnese it is too narrow for modern ocean freighters as it can accommodate ships only of a width up to 176 metres 58 ft and draft up to 73 metres 24 ft ships can pass through the canal only one convoy at a time on a oneway system larger ships have to be towed by tugs 28 the canal is currently used mainly by tourist ships around 11000 ships per year travel through the waterway 29see also  editportage railway references  edit facaros dana theodorou linda 1 may 2003 greece new holland publishers p 172 isbn 9781860118982
