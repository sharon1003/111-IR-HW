replies to how many days per week do most fulltime students attend class1ilove brown registered user posts 1521senior member08292006 at 507 am thats quite unlikely unless you somehow manage to take all mondaywednesdayfriday classes you might manage it for a semester but its very unlikely youd be able to do it for more than that most students attend class every day or at least four days sometimes no friday classes reply2gemstar66registered user posts 766member08292006 at 514 amyou can do it if some classes are mwf and others are mf or mw or mwth mth classes you can do that it will be a tough squeeze and chances are you will have back to back classes but it is possible reply3uvmlauren registered user posts 280junior member08292006 at 534 am if youre transferring to a university they surely have student housingso why not live there since you said its far doing classes only three days a week really depends on your major for example science classes almost never work out to being only three days a week because of labs but it will be tough and you might be able to fudge it for a semester but after that youre really looking at four days a weekminimum reply4jimmy jones registered user posts 42junior member08292006 at 725 am there was a quarter when i was full time and went to class two times a week thats what im talkin aobut reply5valentinaposts 155junior member08292006 at 730 amthere was a quarter when i was full time and went to class two times a week thats what im talkin aobut hahah sweet deal i had a nice semester like that i had a semester last year when i had no friday classes a thursday class that ended at 1200 pm and a monday class that started at 100 pm that meant technically for me the weekend started midday on thursday and didnt end till midday on monday and every week had a guaranteed three day weekend my friends were so jealous though reply6blah de blah registered user posts 581member08292006 at 746 am i have 5 classes next term with tuesdays and thursdays off i didnt actually plan it that way but thats the way it worked out and on fridays i only have one 50minute class so if attendence isnt required i can probably opt out of that one if necessary the downside is that i have 10 hours of class on wednesdays oh well reply7bossgirl517registered user posts 138junior member08292006 at 752 am it is possible i know that they should have classes at a university that are on monday and wednesday currently i am a full time student and i have monday  4 classes tuesday  2 classes wednesday 4 classes thursday 2 classes friday 1 class however three of my classes are mw while i only have one that is mwf so it is possible however you may have little time to eat lunch breakfast etc also you might have to stay oncampus for a while if you are commuting reply8allieregistered user posts 3066senior member08292006 at 823 am im full time and i go two days a week for fall i have tuesday 945am8pm and thursday is 945am5pm have been doing this for a long time its possible reply9kwtortoise registered user posts 654member08292006 at 954 am it depends how the sceduling works at your school mine is so small that most of my classes only had one section offered two if i was lucky so it was nice that i just got all my classes to fit in that i needed if you go to a large school with tons of sections of classes you could just take mwf classes and have a really long day of five classes each right now i have 3 mwf classes 1 tr class 2 labs on t and a lab on r 15 credits it is really rare to find a student taking a full load 15 or more credits that only attends class on some days of the week one of my friends attended a community college that had a policy for no classes on friday but their classes would be mw or tr how far of a drive is it though might be worth living on campus or an apartment if it was more than 30 minutes each way there will be times you may want or have to come back to campus at night or on other days you dont have class if that works some of my classes have tests at night when we dont have class and there are always the inconvenient study group times and club meetings too my opinionreply10polkadotheart registered user posts 279junior member08292006 at 1014 am phh i do it i only go tuesday wednesday night for a language class and thursday tuesday i take four classes one is only once a week wednesday i have the one and thursday i take three im taking 16 credits and at a cc too reply11shellzie2006registered user posts 1267senior member08292006 at 1024 am i have about 4 classes every day counting labs and tutorials and end up in class about 20 hrsweek but thats mainly because i am a science major so i think part of it will depend on your major and desired courses my schedule is something like m4 t4 w5 r4 f3reply12ferst ammendment posts 969member08292006 at 1058 am mwf are the big days i start at 1100 and end at 1530 four classes in there tuethurs i start at 1500 and have two classes reply13ubvinny77posts 678member08292006 at 539 pmmy bro had 21 credits 2 days a week 8am3pm he is a monster lolreply14allieregistered user posts 3066senior member08292006 at 546 pm i should add that since my school is on the quarter system full time is technically only three classes and at most four which makes condensing a schedule easier but my community college was on a semester schedule and i still managed to get it down to 3 days a week on average reply15forgiven registered user posts 1690senior member08292006 at 554 pmsure you can do it i commuted last year and i only had classes on tuesdays and thursdays reply
