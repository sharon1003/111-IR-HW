gettysburg national military park panoramas were invented by irish painter robert barker who wanted to find a way to capture the panoramic view from calton hill in central edinburgh scotland he subsequently opened his first cyclorama building in edinburgh in 1787 cycloramas were very popular in the late 19th century the most popular traveled from city to city to provide local entertainment — much like a modern movie as the viewers stood in the center of the painting there would often be music and a narrator telling the story of the event depicted sometimes dioramas were constructed in the foreground to provide additional realism to the cyclorama circular and hexagonalshaped buildings were constructed in almost every major us and european city to provide a viewing space for the cycloramas for example a 360° depiction of the land and naval battles of vicksburg was completed and first exhibited in paris this work by lucienpierre sergent and joseph bertrand traveled to new york

the use of a live chariot race using real horses and real chariots set against a cyclorama the eras drama critic detailed how it was achieved by four great cradles 20ft in length and 14ft wide which are movable back and front on railways the horses galloped fullpelt towards the audience secured by invisible steel cable traces and running on treadmills electric rubber rollers spun the chariot wheels a vast cyclorama backdrop revolved in the opposite direction to create an illusion of massive speed and fans created clouds of dust the critic for the illustrated london news described it as a marvel of stageillusion that was memorable beyond all else the sketchs critic called it thrilling and realistic  enough to make the fortune of any play and noted that the stage which has to bear 30 tons weight of chariots and horses besides huge crowds has had to be expressly strengthened and shored up 2 it went on to inspire the multioscarwinning 1959 film adaptation of ben hur starring charlton heston  featuring the key live chariot race surviving examples  editsome notable cycloramas are wocherpanorama depicting the city of thun on display in the kunstmuseum thun 38 metres long by
