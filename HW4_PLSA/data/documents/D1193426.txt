premium tax credit the multiple exemptions from the individual mandate and the fairly low penalties suggest that many people will remain uninsured at least in the near term the internal revenue service irs and the department of health and human services hhs have proposed guidance on the individual mandate under the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca including the requirements for minimum essential coverage mec the irs also issued final guidance about family members eligibility for the federal premium tax credit under the individual mandate everyone must maintain mec for themselves and family members unless they are exempt beginning in 2014 or pay a penalty with their federal income tax return taxpayers are responsible for their claimed dependents and married taxpayers filing a joint return are jointly liable for penalties the multiple exemptions from the individual mandate — combined with fairly low penalties — suggest that many people will remain uninsured which poses potential uncompensated care concerns for hospitals and other health care providers at least in the near term comments on the irs proposed regulations are due by may 2 2013 and there will be a public hearing may 29 2013 family members eligibility for premium tax credits based on affordability of selfonly coverage under the irs final regulation an employersponsored plan will be deemed affordable if the employees portion of the annual premium for selfonly coverage does not exceed 95 of the employees household income even if family coverage costs more than 95 of household income those with access to affordable employer plans offering mec cannot obtain federal subsidies in an exchangebased plan this interpretation is consistent with the ppaca the regulations the irs proposed in 2012 and the fact that employer liability for the 3000 annual penalty under the playorpay mandate is partly based on whether the employer offers affordable selfonly mec under the irs proposed regulations however family coverage that costs more than 8 of household income is considered unaffordable thus making family members eligible for the affordability exemption see below minimum essential coverage the hhs proposed regulation expands the types of health coverage that meet the mec standard and confirms that insured and selfinsured employersponsored coverage including cobra coverage and retiree medical coverage qualifies there are no minimum standards for employer coverage it is not clear whether such standards will be developed eventually enabling employers to avoid the 2000 pay penalty by offering a lowvalue plan that covers a narrow range of medical services other mec includes the following medicaid and medicare coverage including medicare advantage planscoverage bought through an exchange or elsewhere coverage under the childrens health insurance program tricare and certain types of veterans coverage foreign health coverage selffunded student health insurance plans refugee medical assistance and ameri corps coverage the proposed regulations would designate state highrisk pools as mec however hhs intends to reassess this designation in the future hhs also spells out criteria and a process by which other coverage may be designated as mec this does not apply to employer coverage which is addressed in a separate statutory category of mec under the department of treasurys authority the regulations confirm that mec includes any eligible employersponsored plan health coverage for excepted benefits does not qualify an individual is considered to have mec for any calendar month in which he or she has acceptable coverage for at least one day during the month exemptions from individual mandate the internal revenue code provides nine exemptions from the individual mandate hardship or domestic circumstances religious conscience membership in a health care ministry incarceration member of an indian tribe not being lawfully present in the u s short coverage gaps household income below the filing threshold inability to afford coverage hhs has proposed processes for exchanges to use in determining eligibility exemptions and granting certificates of exemption for the first five exemptions the irs will determine eligibility for the other four through the tax filing process for most exemptions other than religious conscience or indian tribe membership people must apply for the exemption annually after an exchange grants an exemption it will transmit the individuals name social security number exemption certificate number and any other required information to the irs generally an individual who is exempt for one day is considered exempt for the month affordability exemption the affordability exemption is available to anyone who lacked access to affordable mec for any month affordable coverage may not exceed 8 of the taxpayers household annual income in 2014 hhs will adjust the percentage after that to ascertain affordability the taxpayers household income will be increased by the portion of the required contribution made through a salary reduction arrangement and excluded from gross income for those eligible for an employersponsored plan — whether as an employee or as a family member — affordability is based on the cost of enrollment for this purpose related individuals are those whose eligibility for coverage arises from their relationship to the employee and who are claimed as dependents on the employees federal income tax return for example an employees spouse is a related individual if the employee and spouse file a joint return the required contribution for a spouse and dependents is the employees premium for the lowestcost coverage covering the employee as well as the spouse and dependents available for example if the required contribution for selfonly coverage is less than 8 of household income but family coverage under the same plan is more than 8 of household income the spouse and dependents — but not the employee — would be exempt if two or more family members are employed and their employers offer selfonly and family coverage both employees determine affordability using the premium for the lowestcost selfonly coverage offered by their respective employers in these cases both individuals selfonly coverage may be considered affordable even though family coverage costs more than 8 of household income short coverage gap exemption the short coverage gap exemption is available to those whose continuous period without mec is less than three months and is the first short coverage gap in that year if a coverage gap straddles two years and the firstyear gap is less than three months there is no penalty for the firstyear gap regardless of its eventual duration if the gap were from november to february for example there would be no penalty for november and december deemed mec for u s citizens living abroad and residents of u s territories while u s citizens living abroad are subject to the individual mandate those who live abroad for at least 330 days within a 12month period are treated as having mec residents of u s territories are also considered to have mec exemption for nonresident aliens and those not lawfully present in the u s all u s citizens are subject to the mandate as are permanent residents and foreign nationals in the u s long enough to qualify as resident aliens for tax purposes the proposed regulation clarifies that noncitizens who are not foreign nationals and who are not lawfully present in the u s are exempt for a month in addition nonresident aliens are exempt from the individual mandate hardship exemption the ppaca authorizes hhs to exempt people for whom obtaining coverage is a hardship the proposed regulation describes circumstances that constitute a hardship for this purpose financial or domestic circumstances including unexpected natural or humancaused events that create a significant unexpected increase in essential expenses such that buying health insurance would have deprived the individual of food shelter clothing or other necessities individuals that an exchange determines based on projected household income will not be offered affordable coverage even if due to a change in circumstance it turns out that the coverage would have been affordablecertain individuals who were not required to file an income tax return but who nevertheless filed to receive a tax benefit who claimed a dependent who was required to file a tax return and whose household income exceeded the applicable return filing threshold individuals who would be eligible for medicaid had the state chosen to expand medicaid eligibility the hardship exemption also will be available on a casebycase basis for people whose unexpected personal or financial circumstances prevented them from obtaining coverage computation of individual mandate penalty taxpayers are liable for the penalty for themselves as well as for those eligible for dependent status for the year whether the taxpayer actually claims the individual as a dependent is irrelevant the penalty amount is generally the sum of the monthly amounts for the period without mec the monthly penalty is 112 of the greater of a flatdollar amount or a percentage of income the flatdollar amount is the lesser of a the sum of the applicable dollar amounts 95 in 2014 325 in 2015 695 in 2016 and indexed thereafter or b 300 of the applicable dollar amount if a nonexempt individual is under age 18 at the beginning of a month the applicable dollar amount is onehalf of the regular dollar amount the percentage of income is calculated as the excess of household income over the taxpayers federal income tax return filing threshold multiplied by a percentage — 1 in 2014 2 in 2015 and 25 in 2016 and beyond however the penalty amount for any tax year may not exceed the national average premium for bronzelevel qualified health plans offered through exchanges for the applicable family size under the proposed regulation the applicable national average bronze plan premium must be determined for each month and then aggregated for comparison with the sum of the monthly penalty amounts consequently the applicable national average bronze plan premium may vary from month to month to account for changes in the taxpayers family save  subscribe
