holy magic wielders batman on this week’s episode of th e flash— aptly titled “abra kadabra” — the eponymous character made his small screen debut in a big bad fashion he appeared sporting some of the best hair that has been seen on a dctv show to date in order to flaunt his knowledge of future events with barry and iris…including the true identity of savitar himself a subject i know every reader here has their own theory on on th e flash kadabra is played by david dastmalchian who secretly exists across many different onscreen dc comics universes the first place you probably saw him was in th e dark knight as the most memorable of the joker thugs dastmalchian wore the badge that said dawes and was even interrogated by christian bale’s batman in order to learn more information about the joker’s plan while the character doesn’t have a known name fans of the movie remember him he also recently appeared on go tham as dwight pollard with a rather macabre occupation and connection to someone that i won’t write anything more about in case you’re behind on the show what is so amazing about casting an actor who has appeared in so many different dc universes on th e flash is that it plays into one of the show’s most unique qualities the cw’s dctv universe embraces the multiverse there are a variety of different earths that are acknowledged to exist — heck supe rgirl even takes place in its own little pocket — and th e flash is the show that deals with this in the most direct way who is to say that all of these characters played by david dastmalchian aren’t tied together in a very metatextual way if you’ll dive a little further into the rabbit hole with me on this one what if these dastmalchian connections are not metatextual we know that abra kadabra is a selfproclaimed wizard from the future who uses hyperadvanced technology to create the illusion of magic within that framework these other incarnations could be different disguises that he has worn or other exoskeletal enhancements that he has worked with in the past although if i’m being honest i still think the white kadabra hair is the best look he has worn on screen to date if all of these different personalities are potentially in play on th e flash then there may be enough material to be mined here to fuel an entire episodelong arc if not a crossover event with supe rgirl arrow and legend s of tomorrow based on the events of the this episode and the fact that abra kadabra makes it out the back end almost completely unharmed there seems to be a good chance that he’ll be coming back even if kadabra isn’t the one jumping through vibeportals onto th e flash ’s earth everyone on team flash knows that gypsy has him and that he has an abundance of savitarbased knowledge we may yet see barry vibeing over to earth19 to do some interrogating in the hopes of singlehandedly saving iris’ life i know he mentioned that he was going into the future in next week’s episode but there’s still time for a hearttoheart with abra kadabra before season three is over now if you developed a particular fondness for abra kadabra in his selftitled episode you are definitely in luck my friend the very first arc of the rebirth series titans that i wrote a review for right here on dccomicscom  deals entirely with kadabra doing battle with the adult titans team in order to draw out the newly returned wally west he kidnaps linda park hey we know her from the show too  to draw the heroes out and a really cool battle ensues abra kadabra the alterego of citizen abra a much more subtle name has been a longstanding flash villain originally created by john broome and carmine infantino and debuting in the flash 128 may 1962 since his first appearance his character has remained pretty much intact and hasn’t changed that much over intervening decades originally he was a villain of barry allen’s and traveled back in time to destroy the flash in his younger less refined incarnation from his earliest days the flash has been fighting the future and kadabra was always a big part of that storyline kadabra has also been a member of the rogues teaming up with such popular characters that have appeared on th e flash including captain cold heat wave mirror master gorilla grodd pied piper weather wizard the trickster captain boomerang the top golden glider and rainbow raider fun fact literally every single one of these silver age flash rogues has appeared on th e flash over its first three seasons the only thought i want to leave you with is that if abra kadabra isn’t going be uniting his various otherselves to appear on the flash he might finally be the person to organize the rogues as comic book fans traditionally think of them now that the gang’s usual leader captain cold is—in what’s a fun bit of irony—traveling through time on legends of tomorrow ashley v robinson covers the flash as a part of the dctv couch club you can find her on twitter at ashley vrobinson and on the jawiin you
