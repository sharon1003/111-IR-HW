updated january 9 2018civilization is built on several fundamental principles but perhaps one of the least understood or valued is that of accountability in this age of widespread democracy accountability is taken to mean a variety of things and is a major focus of recent education reform efforts being made at national and state levels one constant in any system of accountability is that to be meaningful it requires measureable results based on agreedupon goals and objectives wellstated clear objectives are fundamental to all professional teaching and measures taken to hold teachers accountable for what their students learn it also means in my opinion that the employers of teachers are also accountable for providing the necessary professional resources to the teachers for them to carry out their professional instructional duties anything short of that is simply dishonest the information on this section of the site is updated as conditions warrant first of all i invite you at this point to check out my program entitled catalyst tools for effective teaching 20 it is an update of the original and begins with a thorough tutorial on how to write behavioral learning objectives it also includes modules on lesson planning classroom management teaching methods and much more please see more information at httpadprimacomwlo5htm for many if not most teachers learning objectives are central to all lesson plans they develop themselves or adapt from those written by others that said objectives that are used in education whether they are called learning objectives behavioral objectives instructional objectives or performance objectives are terms that refer to descriptions of observable student behavior or performance that are used to make inferences about learning  certainly the ultimate aim of all teaching at some point almost every teacher especially new teachers and teacher education students must learn to write these types of objectives here such objectives are referred to as learning objectives acquiring this skill is something of a rite of passage in the process of becoming a teacher yet it is a skill that requires practice feedback and experience over the past 30 years or so the emphasis on and attention paid to learning objectives has waxed and waned as different ideas change about how best to express instructional intent to clarify a bit i have included a rationale for developing and using learning objectives that meet demanding behavioral criteria it provides indepth information that you might find helpful any skill is learned more effectively if the learner understands the reason for learning and practicing it developing this skill in relation composing learning objectives is no exception learning objectives are about curriculum not instruction they are concerned with ends and not necessarily means this is a key point many tend to confuse learning objectives with objectives a teacher may have that relate to student conduct or behavior in a classroom properly constructed behavioral learning objectives are about the evidence of learning they specify what behavior a student must demonstrate or perform in order for a teacher to infer that learning took place since learning cannot be seen directly teachers must make inferences about learning from evidence they can see and measure learning objectives if constructed properly provide an ideal vehicle for making those inferences the purpose of a learning objective is to communicate therefore a wellconstructed behavioral learning objective should leave little room for doubt about what is intended a well constructed learning objective describes an intended learning outcome and contains three parts each of which alone means nothing but when combined into a sentence or two communicates the conditions under which the behavior is performed a verb that describes the behavior itself and the degree criteria to which a student must perform the behavior if any one of these three components is missing the objective cannot communicate accurately therefore the parts of a learning objective are1 conditions a statement that describes the conditions under which the behavior is to be performed2 behavioral verb an action word that connotes an observable student behavior3 criteria a statement that specifies how well the student must perform the behavior a learning objective is the focal point of a lesson plan it is a description of an intended learning outcome and is the basis for the rest of the lesson it provides criteria for constructing an assessment for the lesson as well as for the instructional procedures the teacher designs to implement the lesson a learning objective determines the criteria for any assessment rubric as you will see without a learning objective that clearly communicates specific student behavior or performance it is difficult if not impossible to determine exactly what a particular lesson is supposed to accomplish in order to write learning objectives one should begin with an understanding of the particular content to which the objectives will relate understanding in more than one way the content to be learned should be a goal of teachers as well as students this implies that teachers or others who prepare objectives as part of lesson plans or curriculum documents and guides should have more than superficial knowledge of the appropriate content writing a series of objectives that are within a body of content but which have neither internal nor external consistency with that body of content is not a productive use of time however the purpose of this is not to delve into the area of curriculum consistency but rather present some pointers to help the reader write better objectives so with that in mind lets begin1 the conditions the conditions part of an objective specify the circumstances commands materials directions etc that the student is given to initiate the behavior all behavior relevant to intended student learning outcomes can best be understood within a context of the conditions under which the behavior is to be performed or demonstrated the conditions part of an objective usually begins with a simple declarative statement such as the following upon request the student will this means the student is given an oral or written request to do something given some physical object the student will this means the student is actually given something such as a map a number or multiplication problems a literary passage etc that relates to performing the intended behavior notice that in the examples above there is no mention of the description of the instruction that precedes the initiation of the behavior the instruction that leads to the behavior should never be included in the actual objective instruction that leads students to accomplishing an objective is a separate issue here we want to concentrate on describing only the conditions under which the desired student behavior is to be performed2 the verb we all learned in elementary school that a verb is an action word in a learning objective the verb is also an action word but it is also a special kind of action word the verb in a learning objective is an action word that connotes an observable behavior for example although we as teachers all want our students to appreciate one thing or another it is impossible to see when a student appreciates something understand is another noble word that connotes something we want our students to do but we cannot see understanding the best we can do is make inferences that a student appreciates or understands something based on what the student does or says in a controlled situation what then are behavioral verbs the answer is quite simple a behavioral verb is a word that denotes an observable action or the creation of an observable product verbs such as identify name and describe are behavioral because you can observe the act or product of identifying naming or describing some verbs are embedded in a phrase that gives them a specific behavioral meaning examples are state a rule and apply a rule in this case the behavior is contextual and the context is the rule in question there are many verbs that qualify as behavioral for a list of these verbs and their definitions click here to see examples of verbs used in language arts mathematics science and social studies click here to see some education student produced lesson plans that have behavioral verbs click here3 the criteria the criteria part of a learning objective is a declarative statement that describes how well the behavior must be performed to satisfy the intent of the behavioral verb usually criteria are expressed in some minimum number or as what must be as a minimum included in a student response for example an objective might be of the form given a list of the first 100 numbers arranged in ascending order conditions the student will identify verb at least nine prime numbers criteria notice that the objective doesnt specify which nine numbers and sets a floor of at least nine as a minimum also the method by which the student identifies the minimum nine prime numbers is not specified that is determined in the actual assessment the student could circle the numbers highlight them draw line through them etc it is also implied that the student will be correct if he identifies more than nine correctly but does not specify whether it is acceptable to identify nine correctly and one or more incorrectly according to the objective it would be acceptable to circle the following numbers and still meet the intent of the objective 235711131719232426 because he got nine correct and two 2426 incorrect if the student must identify only prime numbers then the objective would need to be modified to include that provision putting it all together wellwritten learning objectives are the heart of any lesson plan if the objectives you compose are fuzzy and difficult if not impossible to assess the rest of the lesson plan you create that is based on the objective is likely to be flawed before you begin to write an objective spend a little time thinking about what you are describing and remember to make the student behavior observable you will find this process helps you to clarify what you intend and you will be better able to communicate that intent to your students regardless of their grade level age or subject on the matter of being fuzzy remember this fuzzy thinking might get you through the day but it will never get you through a career any time you write a learning objective ask yourself the question does this objective clearly communicate and describe the intended learning outcome if you can find exceptions or loopholes as a way of meeting the objective then the objective should be rewritten learning to write learning objectives that describe what you want takes patience and practice make sure you get as much feedback as possible about your efforts you might also want to read  what does it mean to understand something  it will give you another perspective regarding the ends of these types of specific objectives toward that end i sincerely hope this short explanation is helpful to you this page is a start but if you really want to learn and improve your skills in writing behavioral learning objectives or selecting objectives written by others please consider purchasing my comprehensive selfinstructional interactive program it is available in both download and cd format it is inexpensive
