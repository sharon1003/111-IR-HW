those who tell you of tradeunions bent on raising wages by moral suasion alone are like people who tell you of tigers that live on oranges – henry george 1891introduction colonial times city of

conclusion references chronology notes labor unions have been defined as private combinations of workingmen that try to increase wages and improve working conditions for members but how what means do labor unions use as henry george suggests trade unionists are hardly known for their kindness to strangers and genteel ways from colonial times trade unionists found the going difficult in north america there was no prevailing ideology of workingclass solidarity and unions were far from respectable in fact they had a wellearned reputation for being antisocial even criminal some unions were secret societies with secret oaths and unionists engaged in intimidation threats vandalism and violence especially against uncooperative workers denounced as subhuman scabs and blacklegs private property freedom of contract competition and freedom of movement across occupations slavery and indentured servitude aside were celebrated concepts while governmentgranted monopolies and cartels were not popular at the founding of the american republic courts of law were not fond of union methods either and employers consumers and workers often resisted militant unions competition from imported goods made life difficult too some workers were intensely antiunion not just employers america was an open society a frontier society farmdominated sprawling and free and wages often were double those paid in england because labor was so scarce here although no reliable statistics are available union membership probably remained below one percent of the work force most years from colonial times to the 1870s if a union declared and lost a strike it usually collapsed and disappeared most unions failed during business downturns as jobs union membership and revenue declined while wage rates fell elsewhere in response to depressed business conditions unions stubbornly insisted on maintaining wage rates wage rigidity intensifying their own failure as nonunion labor became less expensive more affordable and induced more hiring production costs fell thereby reducing unemployment such wageprice flexibility shortened business downturns by expanding output and employment thereby acting as shock absorbers in the economy in the vast sweep of the early american economy unions were a curiosity rather than a prominent feature confined largely to skilled trades in big cities and on the railroads not until the late 1870s and prosperous 1880s when political philosophy began to shift toward collectivism and the progressive era did national trade unions gain a real foothold colonial times in the early modern era the european guild system consisted of tightly regulated local occupational and product monopolies which never really took hold in north america a few guilds with apprenticeships existed in the major cities during the 18th century carpenters printing shoemaking tailoring hat making and journeymen from these guilds plus workers benevolent societies formed the core of early19thcentury trade unions most labor protests however were spontaneous actions like that reported in 1763 when according to the charleston gazette negro chimney sweeps had the insolence by a combination among themselves to raise the usual prices and to refuse doing their work before 1800 printers and shoemakers organized in philadelphia and new york philadelphia printers conducted the first recorded strike for higher wages in 1786 opposing a wage cut and demanding a minimum wage of 6 per week 2 employers quickly acquiesced confirming the generalization in industrial relations that unions win short strikes and lose long ones because the average daily wage rate for laborers was 053 and 100 for artisans in the philadelphia area it is not clear that the strike boosted wages for a majority of printers but a cut was thwarted 3city of brotherly love philadelphia was a city of laborunion firsts the first recorded labor strike first labor newspaper first city central body of unions and first laborunion political activity union tactics trade unions in the early republic sought monopoly control over the local supply of labor with the closed shop an arrangement requiring employers to hire union members only selective admission to apprenticeships restricted membership thereby artificially limiting the supply of skilled labor for hire and placing upward pressure on wage rates as in england threats and violence accompanied strikes the typical strike aimed to force employers to pay more than necessary for labor available on the open market the silent corollary was that everyone — union member or no — must strike too that is withhold his or her labor willing or not and refuse employment at pay less than that demanded by strikers alternatively the employer had to be intimidated and decisively discouraged from hiring replacement workers strikebreakers a union warning from the 1830s suggests how unions discouraged interlopers we would caution all strangers and others who profess the art of horseshoeing that if they go work for any employer under the above prices they must abide by the consequences 4the stronger a union is the more it acts like a private state secure in its power and with little overt need to use violence local culture and ideology play a large role because the response of local police courts and politicians to union aggression is pivotal by 1810 union tactics were fully formed bargain collectively demand fixed minimum pay rates enforce closed shops stage strikes with picket lines scab lists strike funds and traveling cards and promote unity among skilled and unskilled workers and solidarity among locals of the same trade but how could threatened collective violence and actual violence by adversarialstyle unions square with the right of each person to seek his or her best opportunity free of interference to strike a bargain for lawful employment a right firmly entrenched in custom and law it could not be union coercion is incompatible with individual freedom of contract an ugly truth ignored by most labor writers but as mises wrote actually labor union violence is tolerated within broad limits…the authorities with the approval of public opinion condone such acts 5the law the courts struggled with the legal status of labor unions from the beginning were such combinations or labor cartels lawful or not according to some legal doctrines unions were criminal conspiracies in restraint of trade and illegal combinations to fix prices for labor services these issues were tested in the state courts from 1806 through 1842 in the famous 1806 criminal prosecution of the philadelphia cordwainers shoemakers commonwealth v pullis a threeday trial led the jury to convict the accused unionists of a criminal conspiracy to fix prices and eight defendants were each fined 8 slightly more than a weeks wages only 18 unionists were convicted on conspiracy charges when this doctrine was at its peak 6 in 1842 massachusetts supreme judicial court chief justice lemuel shaw in the influential decision of commonwealth v hunt ruled the bootmakers union a lawful association with a lawful right to organize and collectively withhold labor strike the courts did not go so far as to authorize threats and violence by unions as legitimate weapons of labor during strikes but as mises pointed out law enforcement was and is lax in many labor disputes the state thereby fails in its alleged basic purpose to protect life property and individual liberty against private aggression1850–1900nearly everything was tried in some form or other during this era socialism syndicalism anarchism cooperatives political unionism and the most seductive idea of all the welding of everybody barring bartenders and bankers into one gigantic union some were secret societies with names like the knights of st crispin the molly maguires and the knights of labor yet the main adhesive of british and european unions — easily aroused class antagonisms — was absent in america and marxiststyle sentiments about the plight of the working class never became the dominant mood contrary to some historical accounts more often american pubic opinion was horrified and disgusted by outbreaks of labor violence and union disruption of production especially if the outbursts had revolutionary overtones eventually one form of unionism emerged as a survivor in this unfavorable environment experiments with political radicalism gave way to socalled business unionism the notion that unions must pursue immediate material gain for members within the freeenterprise system the underlying idea was to accept the capitalist wage price and political system and achieve marginal gains for members within it consequently the ambitions of social visionaries and leftist radicals who saw unions as a vehicle for radical change gradually fell by the wayside the tradition of 20thcentury us unionism was largely the work of the american federation of labor afl and its leader samuel gompers founded in 1881 it was a federation of national trade unions each composed of members of a particular craft such as locomotive engineers or carpenters union membership in the early 1890s was barely 200000 but as the economy expanded after the panic of 1893 unions found more effective methods of organization and membership hit 447000 in 1897 given the formula for national craft unionism unions grew to a modest share of the labor force without enormous government intervention aside from laxity toward union threats and the actual use of violence at the end of the century union membership in the united states was only 500000 or less than 2 of the labor force only a dozen unions claimed more than 10000 members the largest union was the locomotive engineers with 30000 members the cigarmakers were second with 28300 samuel gompers the most famous president of the afl for example came from the cigarmakers which disappeared in a merger with the retail wholesale and department store union in the 1970s while unions existed in many trades at the close of the century they did organize a substantial share of employment in few instances mainly construction railroads printing and the postal service only the railroad and postal unions were direct beneficiaries of prounion federal legislation although 17 state legislatures passed laws during the 1880s and 1890s prohibiting employers from firing employees for belonging to or joining unions reflecting an emerging prounion political climate during this period a prelude to the progressive era 20th century in the early 20th century union membership rose to 6 of the labor force there were 27 million members by 1913 and the share stayed around 6–7 until 1917 this was the progressive era of 1900 through 1918 whichfastened a welfarewarfare state on america which has set the mold for the rest of the twentieth century…because a unique set of conditions had destroyed the democrats as a laissezfaire party and left a power vacuum for the triumph of the new ideology of compulsory cartelization through a partnership of big government business unions technocrats and intellectuals 7world war iprior to world war i unionists were still on a relatively short leash from 1842 onward unions had the clear legal right to exist and workers could join such selfhelp organizations but employers were under no obligation to bargain with these unions the courts also tended ultimately to restrict union tactics such as threats of violence violence itself mob action and interference with voluntary trade further the courts tended to make little distinction between business and union restraints on competition they ruled for example that union actions in a boycott organized by the united hatters of danbury ct against the products of d e loewe and company 1908 were in restraint of trade under the sherman antitrust act of 1890 and fined individual union members responsible for the unions acts unions never incorporated lest they be held liable as an organization for damages they caused unionists therefore prominently demanded governmental privilege and mounted persistent and intensive campaigns for favorable legislation in 1912 congress supplied new assistance with the lloydla follette act to compel collective bargaining by the us post office and encourage postalunion membership in 1914 congress passed the clayton act with provisions to exempt unions from the 1890 sherman antitrust act restrict the use of court injunctions in labor disputes and declare picketing and similar union tactics as not unlawful samuel gompers hailed the clayton act as labors magna carta but subsequent court interpretations neutered the prounion provisions the national emergency of us entry into world war i provided much of the experience and precedent for subsequent intervention on behalf of unionism as well as for other cartellike policies historian william e leuchtenburg for instance points out the panoply of procedures developed by the war labor board and the war labor policies board provided the basis in later years for a series of enactments culminating in the wagner national labor relations act of 1935 8 under pressure of world war i and the governments interventions union membership skyrocketed hitting 12 of the labor force the war labor board and the war labor policies board the latter led by felix frankfurter and modeled on a directive by franklin d roosevelt who represented the united states navy on the board proclaimed governmental support of unions and enforced prounion measures on industry the boards for instance ordered establishment of work councils composed of employee representatives and seized defiant enterprises the government even created a union the loyal legion of loggers and lumbermen and forced lumbermen to join in its battle against the radical leftist industrial workers of the world iww known as the wobblies the loyal legion collapsed after the war despite government efforts to keep it alive while others became socalled company or independent unions subsequently banned by the 1935 wagner act just as the war industries board led by bernard m baruch and army general hugh s johnson was the forerunner for the 1933935 cartelization under the national industrial recovery act nira administered by johnson the war labor boards were forerunners to the federal labor boards used to administer section 7 a of nira and the subsequent national labor relations board nlrb created by the national labor relations wagner act of 19351920s the end of the war ended prounion interventions by 1924 the union share of the labor force had slipped to 8 and by 1933 had eroded to the same 6 as thirty years before but peacetime help was not far off the first durable help for privatesector unionism was the railway labor act of 1926 the labor disputes that erupted periodically on the railroads were highly visible violent unpopular and politically embarrassing although the interstate commerce clause of the united states constitution as interpreted then restricted the ability of the national government to intervene in most economic affairs congress had the unchallenged power to regulate interstate commerce a sequence of federal laws beginning in 1888 regulated railway labor matters and congress passed the 1926 law in almost the identical form agreed on by the major railroads and unions the act amended in 1934 essentially dictated collective bargaining for all interstate railroads and set up machinery for governmental intervention in labor disputes this was an obvious example of monopoly intervention on behalf of an industry the already unionized railroads found it comfortable to impose compulsory collective bargaining on all interstate railroads some of which had resisted union pressure better than others the interstate commerce commission icc in turn fixed freight rates for railroads based on costs which were higher because of unions thus railroad wage and price determination was transferred from the marketplace to the political arena1930s during the great depression congress delivered an amazing sequence of six major pieces of labor legislation favored by unionists virtually revolutionizing labor markets davisbacon 1931 norrisla guardia 1932 national industrial recovery act 1933 wagner national labor relations act 1935 walshhealey 1936 and the fair labor standards act 1938 popularly known as the minimum wage law this avalanche of legislation to entrench unions was hastened by the prevailing doctrine of 1920s business leaders that high and rising wages were necessary to a full flow of purchasing power and therefore to good business which was followed by its corollary that reducing the income of labor is not a remedy for business depression it is a direct and contributory cause 9 this ignorant blather reverses the true line of causation high wages are an effect of high productivity and prosperity not a cause of them if it were otherwise rather than producing themselves rich nations could simply declare all good things cheap and all wages high and thus abolish poverty with pious hopes davisbacon this bill passed in 1931 following a sharp decline in construction activity at the beginning of the great depression construction expenditures went from 11 billion annually to 3 billion with over half of the reduced activity financed by government competition for contracts and jobs was fierce and mobile contractors using migrant labor entered the market to underbid some local contractors many contractors and building trade unions welcomed the law to protect themselves from the competition of what one congressman called carpetbagging sharpie contractors 10the law requires that workers on federally financed construction be paid wages at local prevailing rates for comparable construction work the clearly stated intent was to protect local workers and contractors from the competition of outsiders the ambiguity of prevailing wages gave the united states department of labor scope to set minimum wage rates at union wages in about half of its wage determinations this has cost taxpayers at least a billion dollars per year in higher construction and administrative costs since 1931 congress has extended the prevailing wage provision to include most federally assisted construction whether state local or national government is the direct purchaser additional amendments in 1964 added fringe benefits to prevailing wage calculations the effect of the labor departments administration of the law is not to protect local contractors from competitors but to dish out government work to highcost contractors and the buildingtrades unions davisbacon regulates about 20 of all construction construction workers are among the highest paid in america earning twice the hourly rate of employees in retail trade most states passed little davisbacon acts to further unionize the construction industry and build expensive norrisla guardia antiinjunction act signed by president herbert hoover on march 23 1932 this bill passed the house 36313 and the senate 755 it was the culmination of a 50year union campaign against government by injunction the threefold purpose of the act was todeclare nonunion employment agreements yellowdog contracts unenforceable in federal courts section 3grant labor organizations immunity from liability for wrongful acts under antitrust law sections 4 and 5 andgive unions immunity from private damage suits and nullify the equity powers injunctive relief of federal courts in labor disputes sections 7–12 the overriding object of the act was to free organized labor from the constraints that bind businessmen and others allowing unions more scope to use their aggressive and violent tactics the number of strikes suddenly doubled between 1932 and 1933 to 1695 and then continued climbing to a 1930s peak of 4740 in 1937 this outburst of strikes occurred during a period of deep depression and massive unemployment while previous business downturns had always diminished strike activity and caused many unions to disappear as hayek summed it up we have now reached a state where unions have become uniquely privileged institutions to which the general rules of law do not apply 11nira the national industrial recovery act was among the many roosevelt interventions to boost prices and wage rates on the mistaken theory that falling wages and prices were causing the depression rather than being marketdriven adjustments to recoordinate the economy and restore production and employment the nira — the new deal fascist system of codes to cartelize both industry and labor markets and push up prices throughout the economy — was struck down by the supreme court in the famous schechter poultry case of 1935 on the grounds that the act delegated virtually unlimited legislative power to the president section 7 a of the nira promoted unions and the practices of collective bargaining congress then repackaged similar labor regulations and new interventions piece by piece in surviving legislation like the wagner walshhealey and fair labor standards acts national labor relations act nlra otherwise known as the wagner act the nlra was a rewrite of the niras section 7a the act passed the senate 6312 and an unrecorded voice vote in the house and roosevelt signed it july 5 1935 the nlra remains the overall labor framework in the united states to this day it declares that the labor policy of the federal government is encouragement of the practice and procedure of collective bargaining as well as protection of worker designation of representatives to negotiate terms and conditions of employment it uses federal coercion to make it easier to unionize enterprises and employees in the private sector who otherwise would not participate in unionization and collective bargaining the main regulatory features of the act were as follows the creation of a politically appointed board the national labor relations board to enforce the act thereby escaping the toofrequent apolitical antiunion rulings from courts of law the specification of multiple unfair labor practices by enterprises to hamper their resistance to organized labor nlrb enforcement of majority elections for union representation nlrb determination of eligibility to vote nlrb enforcement of exclusive monopoly bargaining for all employees in a bargaining unit by nlrbcertified unionists only nlrb enforcement of union pay rates for all employees represented whether union members or not in april 1937 contrary to the expectations of many in the congress who had hoped the supreme court would overturn their handiwork as unconstitutional as it had the nira the court declared the wagner act constitutional by a 54 vote in the midst of roosevelts famous threat to pack the court it is no exaggeration to state that the wagner decision marked the judiciarys general abandonment of constitutional protection against federal encroachment on economic rights and due process years later public disgust with adversarial unionism and underworld corruption produced federal legislation to modify the wagner act — principally the labormanagement relations tafthartley act in 1947 and the labormanagement reporting and disclosure landrumgriffin act in 1959 — that has been less favorable to unions though this can be exaggerated neither law tampered with the basic privileges and immunities previously granted to organized labor as legal scholar richard epstein says tafthartley was a partial union victory because it maintained the original structure of the statutes making it more difficult to return to common law 12my favorite section 602a in landrumgriffin although intended to rein in union officials abuse of members rights highlights the immunities the state grants to unions it shall be unlawful to carry on picketing on or about the premises of any employer for the purpose of or as part of any conspiracy or in furtherance of any plan or purpose for the personal profit or enrichment of any individual  except a bona fide increase in wages or other employee benefits by taking or obtaining any money or other thing of value from such employer against his will or without his consent emphasis added the exclusion in parentheses is quite astounding such open exceptions privileges and immunities for labor unions are necessary in legislation if the object of national labor law since the 1930s is to be promoted and achieved namely this involves an organized labor movement freed from the regular constraints of civilization to extract money from employers against their will with the proviso that the loot be mostly paid to union members in wages and benefits public contract walshhealey act passed in 1936 this act tried to accomplish for unions more generally what davisbacon did for the buildingtrades unions but it turned out to be relatively ineffective walshhealey targeted bureaucratic administration of employment conditions for all government contracts over 10000 the law allowed the secretary of labor to fix minimum wage scales among nearly all businesses contracting with the government responsible businesses — that is unionized employers — generally urged that standards be imposed in order to discipline unscrupulous lowcost nonunion competitors yet the department of labor never could settle on a consistent method of determining the prevailing wage for such a bewildering array of jobs individual skills and pay systems evidence that walshhealey is dead for wage and hourfixing purposes can be seen in the fact that the act no longer excites controversy in the business community while davisbacon still does the fair labor standards act passed in congress in 1938 this act set a national minimum wage rate of 25 cents per hour it applied to an estimated 43 of employees in private nonagricultural work and gradually grew to cover nearly 90 state minimum wage laws cover most remaining employees effective july 24 2008 the federal minimum was 655 per hour and becomes 725 per hour effective july 24 2009 a 29fold increase over the first minimum wage in 1938 13 a 90day beginners minimum of 425 per hour applies to workers under age 20 covered nonexempt employees must be paid overtime rates of oneandahalf times the regular pay rate for any hours over 40 in a sevenday period generally the minimum wage has fluctuated between 35 and 50 of the average hourly wage in manufacturing how does the minimum wage help unions less than 10 of all wage and salary employees have wage rates low enough to be directly impacted by the minimum wage essentially unions benefit by pricing competitors and potential nonunion entrants out of business many young people women older people and members of minority groups such as innercity blacks find it more difficult to find beginners jobs because minimumwage and union wage rates price them out of the market yet accepting a lowpaying job for its onthejob training is no different in principle from paying to go to school economic studies show that about half of the training in the us economy occurs on the job rather than in school 14 shrunken work opportunities caused by the minimumwage law have ruined uncounted careers most visibly black teens in the ongoing tragedy of our inner cities milton friedman called the minimum wage law the most antiblack law on the books 15 some antipoverty deviceworld war iiin 1940 congress passed the first peacetime draft compelling conscripts to serve in the military a prelude to the command economy of world war ii 16 of the 16 million who served in the armed forces during the war 10 million were draftees and a depression labor glut turned into a wartime shortage government policy shifted from promoting artificially high prices for labor services to keeping prices artificially low during wartime a series of makeshift commissions and boards were charged with planning and coordinating economic mobilization by fixing prices and wages at belowmarketclearing levels among countless other interventions wartime socialism in other words in january 1942 roosevelt created the national war labor board patterned after the war labor board of world war i to resolve labor disputes by mediation or arbitration the board could and did seize plants in accord with the draft act of 1940 also in early 1942 the president created the war manpower commission and by late in the war tried to make it into a powerful workorfight agency of compulsion though congress never approved an economywide national service law if labor rates had been allowed to clear labor markets by rising rapidly pricecontrolled businesses would have been caught in a costprice squeeze and failed financially so in october 1942 roosevelt got openended authority over all prices and wages the war labor board appeased unions with security arrangements administrative slack in its wage controls and other privileges but gained little labor peace from unions in return despite pledges to the contrary as work stoppages rose to their worst year in 1943 post — world war iilabormanagement relations tafthartley act this act was passed by a republicanmajority congress over president trumans veto in 1947 more democrats joined republicans to vote for the bill and the override than voted against rather than outright repeal of the prounion wagner act tafthartley unfortunately added a list of prohibited union actions or unfair labor practices to balance the nlra which had previously only banned unfair labor practices for employers the tafthartley act outlawed union practices such as jurisdictional strikes wildcat strikes political solidarity strikes secondary boycotts common situs picketing closed shops and money donations by unions to federal political campaigns in the land of the oncefree it also required union officers to sign noncommunist affidavits with the government union shops which compel union membership andor dues payments as a condition to retain a job were restricted and states were allowed to pass righttowork laws that outlawed union shops there are 22 states all in the south and west with righttowork laws finally the executive branch of the federal government could obtain injunctions in the federal courts if an impending or current strike imperiled the national health or safety a test that has been interpreted generously by the courts 17 president george w bush invoked the law most recently in connection with the employer lockout of the international longshoremens and warehouse union during negotiations with westcoast shipping and stevedoring companies in 2002 labor management reporting and disclosure act or lmrda also known as the landrumgriffin act for its sponsors democrat phil landrum and republican robert p griffin the lmrda regulates labor unions internal affairs and unions officials relationships with employers enacted in 1959 after wellpublicized revelations of corruption and undemocratic practices in the teamsters longshoremens association and united mine workers the act requires unions to hold secret elections for local union offices on a regular basis and authorizes review by the department of labor of union members claims of improper election activity other provisions required unions to submit annual financial reports to the department of labor declared that every union officer must act as a fiduciary in handling the assets and conducting the affairs of the union limited the power of unions to put subordinate bodies in trusteeship a temporary suspension of democratic processes within a union specified minimum standards before a union may expel or take other disciplinary action against a member of the union barred members of the communist party and convicted felons from holding union office 18more on union membership with withdrawal of wwi federal intervention duespaying union membership fell throughout the 1920s from a reported peak of 5 million in 1920 to fewer than 3 million by 1933 according to nber figures membership then turned around to more than double to 72 million by 1940 doubled again to a staggering 132 million by 1945 and increased more slowly to 148 million by 1950 there was no such postwar slump in membership after world war i because the prounion legal framework empowering unions remained in place wartime proved prosperous for unions wwii government labor boards operated on net to advance unionization cementing in place the union gains originally created by the wwi and new deal interventions between 1933 and 1945 the unionized fraction of the civilian labor force rose fourfold from 57 to 224 that proportion eroded but remained above 20 during the 1950s since 1960 however a sharp decline in union density has set in all western countries according to oecd data estimated union density in the united states was 309 in 1960 223 in 1980 128 in 2000 and 116 in 2007 while the overall rate of decline has recently slowed the decline in private sector union membership has been partially concealed by union growth in the public sector between 2000 and 2008 for example bls data show a decline in unionization among privately employed wage and salary workers from 92 million to 83 million and an erosion in union density from 90 to 76 privatesector membership peaked at 17 million in 1970 so in total membership has fallen by over half since 1970 membership among governmentemployed wage and salary workers grew modestly from 71 million to 78 million since 2000 with a stable density of 369 in 2000 and 368 in 2008 union density in the private sector now is not much higher than it was in the early 1900s despite massive federal intervention on behalf of unionism since world war i the wageboosting success of privatesector unions has gone hand in hand with their decline in membership nothing fails like success as the silent steady forces of the competitive marketplace continually undermine governmentsanctioned labor cartels publicsector unions publicsector unions are on pace to claim an absolute majority of union members in a traditionally privatesectordominated labor movement within a few years government jobs constitute the healthy part of organized labor where external competition provides little or no discipline against union inefficiency costs and privilege from 900000 union members in 1960 government membership rocketed to 4 million by 1970 nearly 6 million by 1976 and 7 million by 1993 with a growth slowdown to 78 million by 2008 the explanation for the sudden burst of government unionization is another intervention namely president john f kennedys executive order 10988 promoting unionism in the federal bureaucracy which he signed in january 1962 kennedy had received considerable campaign support from unions and his executive order declared that the efficient administration of the government and the wellbeing of employees requires that orderly and constructive relationships be maintained between employee organizations and management the language does not say orderly relationships between employees and managers but between employee organizations and management the order set up procedures for determination of collective bargaining units and recognition of unions compelled agency heads to bargain in good faith and specified unfair labor practices for unions and management the order was less generous than the nlra to unions as it prohibited strikes and established no separate nlrbtype bureaucracy — but it was a beginning the order triggered collectivebargaining laws in states such as michigan new york washington and pennsylvania all of which had substantial privatesector unionism only a halfdozen states in the south and west are completely free of such laws promoting publicsector unionism the national education association nea headquartered in washington dc an unsurprising location is the largest publicsector labor union in the united states with 32 million members although it is not part of the aflcio federation of unions 19employer or employee opposition unions bitterly complain that uniquely american management resistance legal as well as illegal has thwarted employees desire to unionize if true stronger government controls to hamper business opposition and allow open expression of employees desire to unionize might reverse the decline of privatesector unionism that is the rationale for the employee free choice act efca backed by the aflcio and the obama administration this year 20 the bill would amend the national labor relations act to require the nlrb to certify a union as the exclusive monopoly bargaining agent for all employees in a unit appropriate for bargaining upon a finding that a majority had signed valid authorizations designating a labor organization as their agent this procedure often called card check recognition would shortcircuit employer and employee resistance to unionization of the business and its employees a secretballot election conducted by the national labor relations board which unions often lose would no longer be required for nlrb certification and an employer would be compelled to bargain in good faith with the exclusive bargaining agent even though it had failed to win a majority in a secretballot election how far the industrial democracy movement has comean efca law would hardly turn things around for unions however they are a relic of the past subject to competition in the marketplace shifts from goods toward services and from the northeast and upper midwest to the south and west a trend toward smaller companies highertech products and more professional and technical personnel continue to erode the demand for privateunion membership further american workers like the general public have a low opinion of unions and union leaders and surveys consistently show that only one in three us employees would vote for union representation in a secretballot election organizing drives and dramatic confrontations play a small numerical role compared to quiet reductions in the number and size of union establishments and growth in number and size of nonunion establishments 21an economic conclusion while the basic facts of labor history are well known to industrial relations specialists and labor historians their proper interpretation is not most labor historians believe that what is good for unions is good for all labor this belief underlies prounion statist interventions in markets for labor but is entirely false as economic reasoning and evidence prove beyond reasonable doubt first when labor combinations or cartels capture monopoly control over whom employers can hire and impose higher wage rates the number of jobs available in these companies and industries declines this is the simple result of the law of demand when unions raise the price of labor employers purchase less of it while an increase in labor productivity can partially offset higher labor cost labor productivity cannot be raised cheaply or it would have been done already unions are clearly an anticompetitive force in labor markets second workers priced out of work by unions remain unemployed or obtain jobs at nonunion companies a larger labor supply depresses wage rates there so union wage rates come partially at the expense of lower nonunion wages third cartels flourish only where rewards are high and organizational costs low historically highly paid craft workers known as the aristocrats of labor organized instead of downtrodden lowwage workers because they met two conditions union wage rates often decreased employment relatively little because demand for skilled workers was inelastic that is employment levels were relatively insensitive to changes in wage rates at least in the short run craft workers also could organize at low cost because they were few in number had a common mindset low turnover and few or geographically concentrated employers many early economists who sympathized with unions knew unionization could succeed only if restricted to a minority of workers but they endorsed unions as a device to benefit a visible group and ignored the consequences for everybody else especially wage earners outside the unions these economists probably wanted to gain a hearing rather than being dismissed as meanspirited that left the field to a handful of truthtellers like w h hutt and sylvester petro mises set the standard for advocating the blunt truth with no bow toward labor mythology no one has ever succeeded in the effort to demonstrate that unionism could improve the
