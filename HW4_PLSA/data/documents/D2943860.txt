go to this comic explanation  prev comic 1979 april 11 2018history title text historians weve decided to trim the past down to make things more manageable using bcece would you rather we lose the oddnumbered or evennumbered years explanation this explanation may be incomplete or incorrect created by a historian needs to be expanded do not delete this tag too soon this comic quotes a lengthy section of the bloomington daily pantagraphs september 30 1881 issue the tragic event referenced throughout is the assassination of president james a garfield interestingly the article is about how closely studied the incident will or will not be in the future garfields assassination is rarely more than a quick note in a history class leaving only the dry and tedious historians to comb through the details the writer also notes that vast quantities of accounts exist of the national grief and trauma caused by garfields murder and wonders whether students in the future will bother to read those accounts to understand it or simply let historians sum it up without conveying the vastness of the response that fear at least did prove wellfounded most students are not aware of the fallout of the assassination or indeed of garfield at all cueball and megan are discomfited by the fact there exists a vast untapped store of information that they have never read about an event they know little to nothing about despite it apparently causing nationwide trauma this leads to a larger point about the vastness of history and the extreme difficult of learning all of it the article itself references other events that would have been in recent memory at the time of publication for example it cites the defeat of roscoe conkling as a serious event that would fade in importance when compared to garfields assassination conkling was a senator in garfields party who resigned in protest of garfields policies then failed to achieve reelection contrary to the writers belief both these events have faded into roughly the same level of obscurity he also speculates that there may not be any event in american history that matches the level of grief caused by garfields assassination not even that of lincoln in historical memory however the lincoln assassination is still a towering defining event whereas garfields is a footnote the title text indicates that there is more information about the past than can be researched by the manpower of available historians at this time for whatever reason be it lack of funding to carry out research or lack of interested people becoming historians the facetious solution is to just ignore events of either even or odd numbered years this would essentially halve the amount of data to go through and the amount of time to go through it but it would be at the detriment of our understanding of all of the context of said events as an example world war 2 started and ended on odd years but some of the most tideturning battles fall of france most of stalingrad dday happened on even years although this format with small panels above and below a larger one has been seen before there could be an extra joke this time if it is seen as if there were originally five panels to the comic but the second and fourth the even ones were removed transcript in a small panel top left cueball walks up to megan who is sitting on an office chair holding a tablet showing a screen full of to the reader unreadable text megan i read this article in an old newspaper and i cant stop thinking about it below is a large panel twice as wide as the first and much longer it contains the newspaper clip that megan talks about three sections of the text is in normal black font the rest is in gray fontthe public events of the last three months are of the class which will go into its permanent history we have been living in an atmosphere of history which will be immortally preserved even the brief series of important dates to be collated for the use of the schoolboys of centuries hence will contain the day of the assassination and the day of the death of president garfield the intermediate events corelated like the defeat of roscoe conkling will be of great interest but will scarcely be likely to stand prominently out from the page of history written in 1881 to us who have been the witnesses so to speak of the tragic incidents of the times it seems entirely probable that future generations will eagerly scan every feature of the recent bereavement which the nation has suffered how accurately will future generations know the immense volume of grief and sorrow which has rolled over the land will those who come after us ever be able to understand the extent of our loss is there anything in the first century of our history—even the death of the great lincoln—which can be used as a parallel perhaps a careful reading of the daily papers of the present period may give some future antiquarian a fine idea of the feelings of the nation during the past summer but these journals are so large so full of detail that we imagine the coming american will never find time to read the record he must depend on a brief statement meagerly compiled by some dry and tedious historianthe bloomington daily pantagraph september 30 th1881 the third and final panel is the same size as the first below and to the right it contains a zoom in on cueball and megan talking cueball man the past is so big megan how do historians even cope cueball i have no idea megan i honestly have enough trouble just with the present
