cars  transportation buying  selling what do car dealers really pay for their cars follow 6 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer the cost of a new vehicle to a dealer is referred to as its dealer invoice price which is typically based on the following base vehicle price  typically 7 profit margin vehicle options  typically 15 profit margin manufacturers marketing support  a fixed fee per model between 300 and 1000 destination charge  a fixed cost  800 for transporting the vehicle from the factory to dealer the amounts and percentages are typical estimates but may vary among makers and models anything the dealer can command above the total is gross profit however there are other amounts factoredin after the fact for example each manufacturer pays its dealers a holdback varying from 25 of the vehicles sticker price in the form of a rebate after a vehicle is sold manufacturers also offer whats called marketing support in the form of cash given to the dealer that the dealer can use to either reduce the purchase price ie give it to the customer or keep in their pockets there can also be additional revenue paid by the manufacturer for selling certain vehicles during certain promotional periods achieving certain sales goals andor achieving high customer service index csi satisfaction scores dealers can also earn extra income by arranging financing either through their captive finance companies like ford and ford motor credit and even through private lenders who often rebate a percentage point or so some unscrupulous dealers will actually pad interest rates for customers who have difficulty obtaining credit and put the difference right in their pockets adding the additional incentives for selling each vehicle the share of overall incentives for all vehicles sold over a given period paperwork processing fees and any financing profit and deducting sales commissions floorplan financing the dealers own loan for the cars they keep in inventory and you have the net profit made or lost on each transaction many websites like carscom edmundscom and kbbcom can provide you with exact dealer invoice prices for virtually any make model and option combination for used vehicles dealers obtain them in one of three basic ways tradeins wholesale auctions or private party purchase when determining how much a dealer will give in consideration for a tradein the dealer uses any number of reference publications that show the basic values for similar vehicles bought and sold at auction on a local regional and even national basis naturally its going to be less than what they will eventually try to resell the car for as part of its used car inventory most try to allow themselves a 2030 profit margin the benefit of trading in a vehicle is the convenience and the fact that any amount received in trade is not subject to sales tax when buying a new vehicle depending upon the circumstances tradingin a vehicle can be both the most convenient and cost effective blanket statements as to whether its always better to do one thing or another are sheer baloney by those who feel more comfortable just repeating what they may have once heard rather than actually understanding the process in a state where sales tax is 8 a 25000 tradein represents 2000 in sales taxes saved alone plus although not always the best financial decision trading allows you to seamlessly payoff financing and combine other steps whose added convenience and peace of mind is not without value there are all sorts of auctions operated by local regional and national companies manheim is one of the biggest there is no set price vehicle prices are based upon what people in attendance are willing to bid there is no wholesale price that dealers pay rather wholesale value is the average of auction prices for similar vehicles make model trim mileage significant options and condition that dealers use when guesstimating how much a car may be worth in a nonauction setting the notion that dealers get together and some how determine what a particular models wholesale price will be is pure nonsense and urban myth finally although its always been done dealers simply buying used cars outright has become much more common with the supply of used vehicles having never been so short resulting from people keeping their cars longer during a bad economy and cash for clunkers having literally destroyed some 600000 vehicles many dealers have taken to searching local classified ads and making direct offers to buy vehicles from private parties just to stock their inventories of course dealers will try to pay as little as possible as little as they would give in trade but its an open negotiation and dealers have been paying more than ever with used car prices having been supported by the short supply and high demand there are also other opportunities for dealers to obtain new and used inventories such as the liquidation of nearby dealers inventories who may be going out of business or whose franchise agreements were terminated nearby dealers are often quick to buyup these vehicles rather than having to lower their own prices to compete with socalled fire sale prices its also important to know that rebates and incentives offered directly to customers are usually paid directly from the manufacturer they do not reduce the purchase price of the vehicle instead they are applied toward the downpayment this is important because they are taxable in most states any purchase price should be spoken of before any rebates and incentives to prevent dealers from trying to make money the customer should receive for free from the manufacturer is a discount the dealer is providing when its possible to obtain both best of luck i

higher price for the car they are selling to cover what they give you for your trade this is why it is always better to sell your old car first then use that money as your downpayment if you were trying to buy a new car for 3000000 and they offer you 600000 trade you probably could get the car for 2400000 with no trade sophie b · 8 years ago0 5 comment maybe you would like to learn more about
