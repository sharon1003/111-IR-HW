from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search ribbon representation of the human cardiac troponin core complex 52 k da core in the calciumsaturated form blue  troponin c green  troponin i magenta  troponin t 1troponin or the troponin complex is a complex of three regulatory proteins  troponin c troponin i and troponin t that is integral to muscle contraction 2 in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle but not smooth muscle  discussions of troponin often pertain to its functional characteristics  citation needed andor to its usefulness as a diagnostic marker  citation needed or therapeutic target 3 for various heart disorders in particular as a highly specific marker for myocardial infarction or heart muscle cell death contents  hide 1 function2 physiology21 subunits3

links function  edittroponin is attached to the protein tropomyosin and lies within the groove between actin filaments in muscle tissue in a relaxed muscle tropomyosin blocks the attachment site for the myosin crossbridge thus preventing contraction when the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm some of this calcium attaches to troponin which causes it to change shape exposing binding sites for myosin active sites on the actin filaments myosin s binding to actin causes crossbridge formation and contraction of the muscle begins troponin activation troponin c red binds ca2 which stabilizes the activated state where troponin i yellow is no longer bound to actin troponin t blue anchors the complex on tropomyosin troponin is found in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle but the specific versions of troponin differ between types of muscle the main difference is that the tn c subunit of troponin in skeletal muscle has four calcium ionbinding sites whereas in cardiac muscle there are only three views on the actual amount of calcium that binds to troponin vary from expert to expert and source to source  citation needed physiology  editin both cardiac and skeletal muscles muscular force production is controlled primarily by changes in the intracellular calcium concentration in general when calcium rises the muscles contract and when calcium falls the muscles relax troponin is a component of thin filaments along with actin and tropomyosin  and is the protein complex to which calcium binds to trigger the production of muscular force troponin itself has three subunits tn c tn i and tn t each playing a role in force regulation  citation needed under resting intracellular levels of calcium tropomyosin covers the active sites on actin to which myosin a molecular motor organized in muscle thick filaments binds in order to generate force when calcium becomes bound to specific sites in the ndomain of tn c a series of protein structural changes occurs  citation needed such that tropomyosin is rolled away from myosinbinding sites on actin allowing myosin to attach to the thin filament and produce force andor shorten the sarcomere troponin i has also been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro 4individual subunits serve different functions troponin c binds to calcium ions to produce a conformational change in tn itroponin t binds to tropomyosin interlocking them to form a troponintropomyosin complex troponin i binds to actin in thin myofilaments to hold the troponintropomyosin complex in place smooth muscle does not have troponin 5subunits  edittn t is a tropomyosinbinding subunit which regulates the interaction of troponin complex with thin filaments tn i inhibits atpase activity of actomyosin tn c is a ca 2 binding subunit playing the main role in ca 2 dependent regulation of muscle contraction 6tn t and tn i in cardiac muscle are presented by forms different from those in skeletal muscles two isoforms of tn i and two isoforms of tn t are expressed in human skeletal muscle tissue sk tn i and sk tn t only one tissuespecific isoform of tn i is described for cardiac muscle tissue c tn i whereas the existence of several cardiac specific isoforms of tn t c tn t are described in the literature no cardiac specific isoforms are known for human tn c tn c in human cardiac muscle tissue is presented by an isoform typical for slow skeletal muscle another form of tn c fast skeletal tn c isoform is more typical for fast skeletal muscles 7 c tn i is expressed only in myocardium no examples of c tn i expression in healthy or injured skeletal muscle or in other tissue types are known c tn t is probably less cardiac specific expression of c tn t in skeletal tissue of patients with chronic skeletal muscle injuries has been described 8inside the cardiac troponin complex the strongest interaction between molecules has been demonstrated for c tn i – tn c binary complex especially in the presence of ca 2  ka  15x10 −8 m −1  9 tn c forming a complex with c tn i changes the conformation of c tn i molecule and shields part of its surface according to the latest data c tn i is released in the blood stream of the patient in the form of binary complex with tn c or ternary complex with c tn t and tn c 10 c tn itn c complex formation plays an important positive role in improving the stability of c tn i molecule c tn i which is extremely unstable in its free form demonstrates significantly better stability in complex with tn c or in ternary c tn ic tn ttn c complex it has been demonstrated that stability of c tn i in native complex is significantly better than stability of the purified form of the protein or the stability of c tn i in artificial troponin complexes combined from purified proteins relation with contractile function and heart failure  editmutations in the cardiac troponin subunits can result in cardiomyopathies including familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 11diagnostic use tropinology  editan increased level of the cardiac protein isoform of troponin circulating in the blood has been shown to be a biomarker of heart disorders the most important of which is myocardial infarction 12 raised troponin levels indicate cardiac muscle cell death as the molecule is released into the blood upon injury to the heart cardiac conditions  editcertain subtypes of troponin cardiac i and t are very sensitive and specific indicators of damage to the heart muscle  myocardium  they are measured in the blood to differentiate between unstable angina and myocardial infarction heart attack in people with chest pain or acute coronary syndrome a person who recently had a myocardial infarction would have an area of damaged heart muscle and elevated cardiac troponin levels in the blood 13 this can also occur in people with coronary vasospasm a type of myocardial infarction involving severe constriction of the cardiac blood vessels after a myocardial infarction troponins may remain high for up to 2 weeks 14cardiac troponins are a marker of all heart muscle damage not just myocardial infarction which is the most severe form of heart disorder however diagnostic criteria for raised troponin indicating myocardial infarction is currently set by the who at a threshold of 2 μg or higher critical levels of other cardiac biomarkers are also relevant such as creatine kinase 15 other conditions that directly or indirectly lead to heart muscle damage and death can also increase troponin levels such as renal failure 16 17 severe tachycardia for example due to supraventricular tachycardia in an individual with normal coronary arteries can also lead to increased troponins for example it is presumed due to increased oxygen demand and inadequate supply to the heart muscle troponins are also increased in patients with heart failure where they also predict mortality and ventricular rhythm abnormalities they can rise in inflammatory conditions such as myocarditis and pericarditis with heart muscle involvement which is then termed myopericarditis troponins can also indicate several forms of cardiomyopathy such as dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or left ventricular hypertrophy peripartum cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy or infiltrative disorders such as cardiac amyloidosis heart injury with increased troponins also occurs in cardiac contusion defibrillation and internal or external cardioversion troponins are commonly increased in several procedures such as cardiac surgery and heart transplantation closure of atrial septal defects percutaneous coronary intervention or radiofrequency ablation noncardiac conditions  editthe distinction between cardiac and noncardiac conditions is somewhat artificial the conditions listed below are not primary heart diseases but they exert indirect effects on the heart muscle troponins are increased in around 40 of patients with critical illnesses such as sepsis there is an increased risk of mortality and length of stay in the intensivecare unit in these patients 18 in severe gastrointestinal bleeding there can also be a mismatch between oxygen demand and supply of the myocardium chemotherapy agents can exert toxic effects on the heart examples include anthracycline cyclophosphamide 5fluorouracil and cisplatin  several toxins and venoms can also lead to heart muscle injury  scorpion venom snake venom and venom from jellyfish and centipedes  carbon monoxide poisoning or cyanide poisoning can also be accompanied by release of troponins due to hypoxic cardiotoxic effects cardiac injury occurs in about onethird of severe co poisoning cases and troponin screening is appropriate in these patients 19 20some patients with dissection of the ascending aorta have elevated troponins and increased hemodynamic stress has been suggested as a mechanism 21in both primary pulmonary hypertension pulmonary embolism and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd right ventricular strain with increased wall tension and ischemia of course patients with copd exacerbations might also have concurrent myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism so care has to be taken to attribute increased troponin levels to copd central nervous system disorders can lead to increased sympathetic tone andor catecholamine release which lead to cardiac overstimulation this is seen in subarachnoid hemorrhage stroke intracranial hemorrhage and generalized seizures in patients with epilepsy or eclampsia for example patients with endstage renal disease can have chronically elevated troponin t levels which are linked to a poorer prognosis 22 23 troponin i is less likely to be falsely elevated 22strenuous endurance exercise such as marathons or triathlons can lead to increased troponin levels in up to onethird of subjects but it is not linked to adverse health effects in these competitors 24 25 26 high troponin t levels have also been reported in patients with inflammatory muscle diseases such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis 27 28 troponins are also increased in rhabdomyolysis in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy such as preeclampsia elevated troponin levels indicate some degree of myofibrillary damage 29 30cardiac troponin t and i can be used to monitor drug and toxininduced cardiomyocyte toxicity  31prognostic use  editelevated troponin levels are prognostically important in many of the conditions in which they are used for diagnosis 32in a communitybased cohort study indicating the importance of silent cardiac damage troponin i has been shown to predict mortality and first coronary heart disease event in men free from cardiovascular disease at baseline 33subunits  editfirst c tn i 34 and later c tn t 35 were originally used as markers for cardiac cell death both proteins are now widely used to diagnose acute myocardial infarction ami unstable angina postsurgery myocardium trauma and some other diseases related with cardiac muscle injury both markers can be detected in patient’s blood 3–6 hours after onset of the chest pain reaching peak level within 16–30 hours elevated concentration of c tn i and c tn t in blood samples can be detected even 5–8 days after onset of the symptoms making both proteins useful also for the late diagnosis of ami 36detection  editcardiac troponin t and i are measured by immunoassay methods 37 38due to patent regulations a single manufacturer  roche diagnostics distributes c tn t a host of diagnostic companies make c tn i immunoassay methods available on many different immunoassay platforms 38troponin elevation following
