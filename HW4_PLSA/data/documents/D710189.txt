what is a ferritin test what preparation is necessary for the ferritin test how are the results of the ferritin test interpreted what do abnormal results of a ferritin blood test mean what is a ferritin test a ferritin test is a laboratory blood test that measures the amount of ferritin in a persons blood stream ferritin is the major iron storage protein in the body so the ferritin test is ordered as an indirect way to measure the iron stores in the body the ferritin test is often ordered as part of a panel of tests that examine the levels of body iron and the effects of abnormalities in iron storage it may be ordered together with an iron level a total iron binding capacity test or blood cell counts what preparation is necessary for the ferritin test the ferritin test is measured in a blood sample withdrawn from a vein as for any routine blood test it can be performed at any time of day and no special preparation for the test is necessary how are the results of the ferritin test interpreted the normal range for ferritin levels is rather broad and varies slightly among laboratories normal ferritin levels are higher for men than for women high or low levels of ferritin are suggestive of an iron storage disorder or iron deficiency anemia respectively as with any blood test the result is interpreted together with the result of other laboratory tests and a thorough patient physical examination and medical history to establish a diagnosis womens screening tests slideshow mens screening tests slideshow what do abnormal results of a ferritin blood test mean low levels of ferritin are seen in iron deficiency the body uses iron to produce the hemoglobin that is critical for the red blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues of the body iron deficiency anemia or a decrease in red blood cells is the result serious cases of anemia can produce symptoms such as shortness of breath fatigue dizziness pale skin and fast heartbeat although mild cases may not be apparent and may first be noticed when blood tests are performed for other reasons elevated levels of ferritin can mean that the body has too much iron hereditary hemochromatosis is an example of an inherited iron storage disease in which there is excessive accumulation of iron in the body  iron overload  in individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis the daily absorption of iron from the intestines is greater than the amount needed to replace losses since the normal body cannot increase iron excretion the absorbed iron accumulates in the body the accumulation of iron in different organs including the heart liver joints and testicles in men damages these organs over time potentially causing heart failure cirrhosis diabetes joint pain and sexual dysfunction women can also have hereditary hemochromatosis but because they lose more iron than men due to iron loss from menstruation symptoms begin at a later age than in men ferritin levels are also commonly elevated when there is underlying inflammation in the body in this setting ferritin is sometimes referred to as an acute phase reactant similar to erythrocyte sedimentation rate or esr creactive protein or crp  reviewed on 11212017medically reviewed by john a daller md american board of surgery with subspecialty certification in surgical critical care reference fauci anthony s et al harrisons principles of internal medicine 17th ed united states mc grawhill professional 2008
