considering ethanolfree gas try an ethanol treatment instead if you’re hunting down nonethanol gas stations consider this first ethanol fuel burns cleaner and more efficiently and helps increase octane while the waterattracting alcohol in these blended fuels can lead to potential problems they’re easy to prevent all it takes is some basic knowledge about what’s going into your fuel tank what is ethanol ethanol is the same alcohol used in alcoholic beverages but with water removed so it’s suitable for blending with gasoline it helps increase octane and burn fuel more efficiently why is ethanol added to fuel refiners have added ethanol to fuel for years because it burns cleaner than pure gas now federal regulations are requiring them to use increasing amounts of ethanol to help reduce america’s dependence on foreign oil most u s gasoline now contains a blend of up to 10 ethanol e10 fuel but newer automobiles are being advertised as capable of using up to 15 ethanol e15 fuel what problems can be caused by ethanol in gasoline although these blended fuels burn cleaner than pure gasoline the ethanol absorbs moisture from the air over time that water can separate and drop along with ethanol to the bottom of your fuel tank this is when problems like corrosion stalling and engine damage start what should i do about it ethanol isn’t a problem for cars and trucks that are used daily especially if you use an ethanol additive treatment or a fuel stabilizer at every fill up to remove water and keep gas fresh it’s another story when it comes to ethanol treatment for the fuel systems in boats snowmobiles atvs motorcycles and small engine outdoor power equipment that sits idle for long periods of time no you don’t need to hunt down ethanolfree gas in your area just two steps are all that’s needed to prevent costly engine repairs step 1 keep the tank as full as possible moisture condenses in the empty space in the tank so reducing the amount of air decreases the amount of water that can enter while many manufacturers recommend draining all gasoline it’s nearly impossible to completely empty a builtin tank instead top off the tank to 95 full to allow for expansion and minimize explosive vapors and use a gas treatment or fuel stabilizer step 2 use an ethanol treatment or fuel additive these products are designed to help offset the effects of moisture in today’s ethanol blended fuels for boats and jet skis it’s important to use a product that’s specially formulated for marine conditions still considering using 100 gas head on over to the stabil brand facebook page and let us know what other ethanol concerns you have
