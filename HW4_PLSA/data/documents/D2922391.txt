question anybody can answer the best answers are voted up and rise to the top how should minor children be listed as ira beneficiariesup vote6down votefavorite ive heard conflicting information on how minor children should be listed as beneficiaries of an ira and perhaps for life insurance this is where there is a testamentary trust to provide for the child in the case of the death of both parents one school of thought says to use the childs name directly the other way is to make the trust the beneficiary we can assume that the trust meets the requirements on page 36 of irs pub 590 so that the children are treated as designated beneficiaries which way is better and what does better mean does it depend on state law or the terms of the trust are there tradeoffs to either approach  yes ill be asking the lawyer but id like to educate myself about this choice before i get there  so bonus points for good referencesunitedstates ira children willshare improve this questionasked apr 13 12 at

and this eliminates the opportunity to take withdrawals over the beneficiaries lifetimes theres a five year distribution requirement also with a proper beneficiary set up on the ira account the will does not apply to the ira an ira with me as sole beneficiary regardless of the will saying all my assets i leave to the aspca this is also a warning to keep that beneficiary current its possible that ones exspouse is still on ira or 401 k accounts as beneficiary and new spouse is in for a surprise when hubbywife passes sorry for the tangent but this is all important to know the funneling of a beneficiary ira through a trust is not for amateurs if set up incorrectly the trust will not allow the stretchlifetime withdrawals but will result in a broken ira trusts are not cheap nor would i have any faith in any attorney setting it up i would only use an attorney who specializes in trusts and estate planning as littleadv suggested they dont have to be minors it turns out that the expense to set up the trust 1k2k depending on location can help keep your adult child from blowing through a huge ira quickly id suggest that the trust distribute the rmds in early years and a higher amount say 10 in years to follow unless you want it to go just rmd for its entire life or greater flexibility releasing larger amounts based on life events the tough part of that is you need a trustee who is willing to handle this and will do it at a low cost if you go with childs name only i dont know many 1821 year old kids who would either understand the rmd rules on iras or be willing to use the money over decades instead of blowing it edit  a wsj article inherited iras a sweet deal and my own on my death please take a breath an article that suggests for even an adult education on how rmds work is a great ideashare improve this answeredited apr 13 12 at 1919answered apr 13 12 at 1732joe taxpayer ♦135k 21 213 432thanks for the warning ive been having the same thoughts  and im certainly not going to attempt to set it up myself fwiw i dont know many 35 50 or 65 year olds who understand the rmd rules on iras – bstpierre apr 13 12 at 1833bstpierre  as a part time finance blogger i am appalled at the lack of expertise by the actual professionals when it comes to iras and specifically the rules of inheritance – joe taxpayer ♦ apr 13 12 at 1921true but im not actually surprised that a typical lawyer is ignorant of the rules they are incredibly complex – bstpierre apr 14 12 at 22533elsewhere i am helping someone with an ira question her cpa told her to consult a tax autorney the tax autorney said she needs a cpa and the ira custodian says they cannot offer any advice at all i respect lawyers but only those who are expert at their chosen focus – joe taxpayer ♦ apr 14 12 at 2323add a commentup vote1down vote i think that better is up to a discussion but the difference is that while in trust you can control the money after your death in some way  giving it directly to children means you have no such control ie  in trust you can stipulate that the children will be able to spend the money under certain terms or in certain ways for example  for college only after getting married no more than 10 of the value a year etc giving their names as the beneficiaries means that they get the money and can do with it whatever they please btw minor has nothing to do with it they dont have to be minors or your children at allshare improve this answeranswered apr 13 12 at 1704littleadv110k 10 162 2881i understand the answer youve given but minor is actually the crux of the question if the minor child is the designated beneficiary not the trust then does the guardian have control over those assets until the child reaches majority versus the trustee if the guardian and trustee are different people as i understand it ira custodians will not deal with a minor the minor does not have the legal capacity to deal with the ira – bstpierre apr 13 12 at 1822bstpierre i didnt understand that your question was guardian vs trustee for minors it depends on the state laws as they cannot enter contract however guardian can do anything he wants as long as its considered to be for the benefit of the child while the trust does what you prescribe it to do – littleadv apr 13 12 at 1824add a commentup vote0down vote i would like to bring up some slightly different points than the ones raised in the excellent answers from joe taxpayer and littleadv the estate can be the beneficiary of an ira  indeed as has been pointed out this is the default beneficiary if the owner does not specify a beneficiary  but a testamentary trust cannot be the designated beneficiary of an ira a testamentary trust that meets the requirements laid out on page 36 of publication 590 is essentially a passthrough entity that takes distributions from the ira and passes them on to the beneficiaries for the case being considered here of minor beneficiaries the distributions from the ira that pass through the trust must be sent to the legal guardians or other custodians of the minors utma accounts and said guardians must invest these sums for the benefit of the minors and hand the monies over when the minors reach adulthood minors are not responsible for their support and so these monies cannot be used by the legal guardian for oaying the minors living expenses except as provided for in the utma regulations when the minors become adults they get all the accumulated value on their utma accounts and can start taking the rmds personally after that and blowing them on motorcycles if they wish thus the advantage of the testamentary trust is essentially that it lets the trustee of the trust to decide how much money over and above the rmd gets distributed each year the minors and soontobe young adults cannot take the entire ira in a lump sum etc but must abide by the testamentary trustees ideas of whether extra money over and above the rmd should be taken out in any given year how much discretion is allowed to the trustee is also something to be thought through carefully but at least the rmd must be taken from the ira and distributed to the minors utma accounts or to the persons as they reach adulthood each year regardless of whether the traditional ira goes to beneficiaries directly or through a testamentary trust its value as of the date of death is still included in the estate and estate tax might be due however beneficiaries can deduct the portion of estate tax paid by the estate from the income tax that they have to pay on the ira withdrawals estate planning is very tricky business and even lawyers very competent in estate and trust issues fall far short in their understanding of tax law especially income tax lawshare improve
