throughout the country according to aljazeera’s timeline the protests gained more strength when widespread strikes happened throughout the country jack shenker writing for the guardian described downtown cairo as a “war zone” filled “with running street battles” 6 according to wikipedia promubarak supporters escalated the violence when they rode on camels and horses into tahrir liberation square the mubarak government tried to crush protest with armed forces and plainclothed supporters and when those tactics failed state media depicted the protesters as foreign agents the government also targeted foreign journalists and human rights workers however during the protests muslims and christian egyptians demonstrated unity and according to wikipedia’s timeline muslims protected christian demonstrators during sunday service 7 mona seif an egyptian woman interviewed by aljazeera said there was one egypt inside tahrir and another egypt outside 8protests in egypt portrayed more than political will aljazeera correspondent fatima naib said “egyptian women just like men took up the call to hope here they describe the spirit of tahrir  the camaraderie and equality they experienced  and their hope that the model of democracy established there will be carried forward as egyptians shape a new political and social landscape” 8on february 11 2011 hosni mubarak resigned

all khalid said” twitter black berry messenger and blogs were tools people in egypt used to exchange information globally in an article in ahram english an egyptian newspaper “by themselves sm do not cause popular uprisings demonstrations and revolutions after all this technology is to be found everywhere though certainly with restrictions in some places but we do not live in a world of constant global revolt” 12the ahram article adds that if protest movements access significant numbers of people for any opposition event they can somewhat confidently act on their political motivations and challenge the state” these outlets provide organizers and people a safe space to organize and potentially gain more support 12 google executive wael ghonim developed the facebook page “we are all khalid said” after an egyptian activist killed by the police the facebook group helped organize over 100000 people to protest on egypt’s police day originally the facebook page aimed for 50000 people to protest 13according to aljazeera english on jan 27 people reported disruptions to their facebook twitter and black berry messenger service the disruption to internet service lasted until february 2 but internet services were “partially restored in cairo after a fiveday blackout aimed at stymieing protests” 14 the use of social media to intensify the protests is a contested one according to mary botarri writing for prwatch in the end we may discover that the oldfashioned friday prayer service was the critical vehicle for educating and mobilizing the great unwired but facebook appears to have played an important role in mobilizing the younger more urban and wired classes giving them the comfort of an online community and making it safer to take collective action” 15postmubarak on march 20 the interim military government held elections to garner where egyptians stood on amendments concerning electing a leader according to the new york times “voters were asked to either accept or reject eight constitutional amendments as a whole — all of them designed to establish the foundations for coming elections most addressed some of the worst excesses of previous years — limiting the president to two fouryear terms for example to avoid another president staying in office as long as mr mubarak the amendments were announced feb 25 after virtually no public discussion by an 11member committee of experts chosen by the military” 16 according to the new york times article some people argue that “early elections would benefit the brotherhood and the old governing party which they warned would seek to write a constitution that centralizes power much like the old one” 16according to human rights watch the ruling egyptian generals may be trying to avoid holding egyptian soldiers who were involved in death of more than 20 coptic christians accountable for their role on october 9th 1000 christians attempted to stage a peaceful sitin outside the state television building the protesters

in the midst of widespread violence and unrest in the days prior to the election thousands of protesters violently clashed with the interimmilitary led government many protesters argued that demands from the original protests against mubarak at tharir square had yet to be addressed leading protesters to question the legitimacy of the elections voters were urged by protesters to boycott the elections and many liberal candidates suspended their campaigns arguing that elections should be delayed to allow opposition candidates more time to organize their campaigns 18 the elections nonetheless took place as scheduled the islamist parties claimed an astounding victory early receiving 65 of the total vote the more moderate muslim brotherhood got 40 of the vote whereas ultraconservative salafi groups got 25 allowing for the formation of a islamist majority coalition the islamist parties are said to have enjoyed a decisive organizational advantage in light of their wellestablished base of support that was developed during the mubarak years the liberal parties were comparatively newer and less organized and were thus less able to stage an effective campaign the strength of the islamist coalition is expected to grow stronger as more votes are counted from rural more conservative areas of egypt the final vote tally will not be completed until two more rounds of voting have occurred 19on december 20th 2011 hundreds of women took to the streets of cairo to protest the military governments brutal treatment of female protesters the demonstration took place in

a heart attack and over 100 protestors were injured the protests in jordan differ from tunisia and egypt because they don’t want to oust their monarch much of the dissent is centered around economic issues such as the defecit and inflation a jordanian man interviewed by the washington post said i cannot imagine the country without the royal family they strike a balance between the people and the government i trust them 31the main goals of the protests were to lower food prices amend the electoral law free and fair elections ending government corruption and a responsible and representative government king abdullah in return dissolved the parliament and removed prime minister samir rifai the king also met with opposition groups and expressed his readiness to address the grievances and demands of the people 32the protest draws more concern for the monarchy than reckless individuals according to al jazeera “the jordanian government is specifically concerned about rising calls for the establishment of a constitutional monarchy which would entail reducing king abdullah’s powers so that the king would no longer appoint or dissolve governments or disband parliaments  prerogatives he seems reluctant to give up” 32lamis andoni writing for al jazeera said “the protests appeared to be intended to split the population by appealing to fears of the supposedly palestiniandominated brotherhood among jordanians of east bank descent and in so doing it has succeeded in deepening an already simmering crisis and further undermining social cohesion within the country” 32palestinians in jordan constitute more than half of the country’s population “and this dynamic partly explains why jordanians have shied away from calling for regime change for the hashemites are widely seen as guarantors of stability in the face of israeli extremists’ calls for the establishment of a substitute palestinian state in jordan” said andoni 32on october 17th king abdullah ii fired his government in an effort to expedite the process of political reform the previous government was accused of dragging its feet on reform measures king abdullah ii would appoint prime minister awn khasawneh who was formerly a judge at the international court of justice 33prime minister awn khasawneh would resign on 26 april 2012 without any clear explanation 34 in a letter to awn khasawneh king abdullah ii complained that achievements so far are far less than what is required and way below what we expected 35 after accepting khasawnehs resignation king abdullah immediatley appointed former prime minister and chief of the royal court fayez tarawneh as current prime minister bahrain the protests for democracy influenced by other regional upheavals erupted in bahrain on feb 14 the movement like many others began online almost 30 people were killed since the beginning of the protests and according to reuters “bahrain has stepped up arrests of cyber activists and shiites with more than 300 detained and dozens missing since it launched a crackdown on prodemocracy protests…” 36the equivalent to egypt’s liberation square bahrain’s peal roundabout became the symbol of the uprising says reuters the protesters are calling for more political freedom but the protests hit on sensitive gulf issues because it is dominated by shi’ite muslims according to reuters “bahrain’s largest shiite opposition group wefaq accepted kuwaits offer to mediate in talks with the government to end the political crisis” troops from saudi arabia have also intervened to cool the uprising 36on april 5 president of iran mahmoud ahmadinejad called for saudi troops to leave the protesters alone and to leave bahrain “where they are helping a sunni monarchy put down a shi’iteled protest movement demanding equal rights and a political voice” 37bahrain is a key middle eastern ally for the us this strong relationship between bahrains ruling regime and the united states has resulted in a relatively muted response from the united states to the ongoing protests in october 2011 for example the u s state department failed to directly condemn bahrains government for its egregious sentencing of 20 doctors involved in the protests 38five opposition parties have formed a coalition denouncing sunni reign and demanding a transition to a constitutional monarchy they issued what they referred to as the manama document on october 12th which declared that the ruling khalifa party should govern without powers in a constitutional monarchy 39may 15 palestinian protests along with popular protests from neighboring countries palestinian youth and supporters called for a protest against israeli occupation on may 15 the day palestinians consider the nakba catastrophe protests began on the borders israel shares with egypt lebanon jordan syria gaza and the west bank social media months before the protests the facebook group the third palestinian intifada began organizing palestinians within the territories and the diaspora the group was shut down after the israeli government and jewish organizations in america petitioned the facebook administration according to the huffington post jewish groups felt the content on the group’s page had “crossed the line from free speech to violent incitement” before the group was shut down it accumulated over 300000 facebook “likes” 40 according to the ap “since its removal several other pages with of the same name have been created – each attracting only a few hundred likes apiece” 41the backlash from jewish groups raised questions whether “facebook should be used to facilitate some popular uprisings but not others and even whether facebook founder and ceo mark zuckerberg has lost touch with his familys jewish roots” 42protests before the may 15 protests began protests in jerusalem turned violent when israeli soldiers were injured by a molotov cocktail and several palestinians were injured by rubber bullets earlier that day milad ayyash 16 was shot in the stomach by israeli soldiers in the east jerusalem area of ras alamud protests intensified on may 15 when palestinian refugees in syria gaza and lebanon held demonstrations on the israeli border protesters on syrian and lebanese borders managed to enter into israel israeli soldiers cracked down on the protesters killing 20 and injuring hundreds 43the egyptian military halted buses heading for the egyptian and israeli border town of rafah however over 1000 protesters in egypt demonstrated outside of the israeli embassy in cairo the protest began peaceful and intensified when demonstrators rushed towards the entrance of the embassy egyptian soldiers responded by launching tear gas into the crowd and shooting rubber bullets and live ammunition 44 in jordan over 500 protesters headed towards the israeli border but were cut off by jordanian police before they could reach the border 45obama supports 1967 borders in president barack obama’s may 19 speech he said that palestine “should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states” and “the palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves and reach their potential in a sovereign and contiguous state” 46however obama’s balancing act ignored many vital issues such as the status of jerusalem the right of return and the hamas and fatah unification government israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu flatly refused obama’s statements stating the 1967 lines are “indefensible and would leave major israeli population centers in judea and samaria beyond those lines” the “israeli population centers” are commonly referred to as israeli settlements in the west bank 47saudi arabia similar to jordan protests in saudi arabia are directed towards more freedoms than ousting the monarchy the protests in comparison are relatively small ranging from 100 to 4000 people however king abdullah according to aljazeera “has tried to head off unrest in the kingdom with a series of economic reforms  which include housing subsidies unemployment benefits and a programme to give permanent contracts to temporary government workers state employees will receive 15 per cent raises” 48the protesters are calling for “an elected consultative council an independent judiciary and a serious anticorruption push” 48 they are also calling for saudi arabia to pull their troops from bahrain according to reuters the protests like the ones in bahrain have been staged in the city by minority shiites who complain of discrimination at the hands of the sunni majority 24on september 25 king abdullah granted women the right to vote and run in future municipal elections the move was surprising because saudi arabia is known for its widespread stifling of womens freedom saudi women have traditionally been not been allowed to drive and are required to be accompanied in public by a male chaperone the move was view by saudi women largely as a response to the arab spring spreading across the middl east the decree however will not enter into effect until 2015 49syria protests in syria though on a small scale faced

syria left the country in response to threats to his safety fords prescence had stirred controversy because of his frequent criticism of the repressive policies of the syrian government he also paid a visit to the city of hama which has been the site of large demonstrations by syrian protesters and attended a funeral for a slain activist 54as of october 2011 the crackdown by the assad regime has resulted in the loss of at least 3000 lives according to estimates by the united nations 55on november 27 2011 the arab league imposed broad sanctions in syria to punish the government for its continuing crackdowns against its citizens the sanctions were levied in response to syrias failure to allow arab league observers into the country to monitor the governments adherence to a peace accord that syria had signed just three weeks earlier provisions of the sanctions include prohibiting commercial transactions with the syrian government a travel ban on syrian government officials the freezing of syrian assets in arab countries and a ban on transactions with syrias central bank this type of action against an arab league member state was unprecedented 56 shortly after the arab league announced the sanctions turkey also moved to impose its own sanctions 57as of september 21st 2012 the situation in syria has escalated into an ongoing civil war that has claimed over 29000

began on january 27 2011 59 16000 citizens lined the streets of the capital city of sanaa calling for an end to the 32 yearlong rule of ali abdullah saleh 60 the original protests were inspired by the uprisings in egypt and tunisia the protesters chanted things such as enough being in power for over 30 years and no to extending presidential tenure no to bequeathing the presidency 61 as mother jones explained yemen is the poorest country in the world which also serves as a fuel for anger for the yemeni people 62saleh returned to yemen on september 23 2011 after having been hospitalized in saudi arabia for nearly four months due to severe injuries suffered during an attack on his presidential compound his return spurred violent confrontations between those still loyal to saleh and the forces of dissident gen ali mohsen alahmar whose forces controlled much of the capital the general claims that saleh intends to ignite a civil wart hat would bring down the whole country and have

of the united states akin to the former u segypt relationship with hosi mubarak the wikileaks diplomatic cables also known as cable gate 65 showed that saleh in a cozy relationship with david petraeus opened up the country for the u s to attack his own people the cable from the january 2010 meeting with petraeus agreed to a have u s fixedwing bombers circle outside yemeni territory ready to engage al qaeda in the arabian peninsula targets should actionable intelligence become available 66 it was described as an open door to attack yemen and in the meantime stoking the fire domestically and deceiving his own people in order to unite under his rule blamed the launching of cruise missiles on rebel forces yet the truth is that saleh agreed to let americans bomb his country and agreed to continue lying about it 67baumann puts it this way yemens citizens are the poorest in the arab world and yemen for all its talk about being a republic is a particularly nasty dictatorship complete with the usual secret police and torture and general repression the u s role in yemen is also extremely controversial and shouldnt be underestimated as a contributing factor in the uprising against

september 11 2001 president george w bush put yemen on a list of potential early targets in the war on terror he could have swiftly dismantled salehs government despite salehs pre911 declaration that yemen is a graveyard for the invaders but saleh was determined not to go the way of the taliban and he wasted little time making moves to ensure he wouldnt 68saleh proceeded to board a plane to the united states in nov 2001  during that trip bush and saleh crafted an agreement through which u s special operations troops would deploy to yemen and create a counterterrorism camp run by the central intelligence agency the marines and special forces they were and still are housed in camp lemonier located in djibouti 69 not too long thereafter the joint special operations command set up camp there to begin a campaign of targeted assassinations of socalled terrorists and members of al qaeda numerous targeted assassinations have gone awry with scores of yemeni citizens having been killed while the assassinations unfurled over 60 documented al qaeda attacks on yemeni soil took place scahill wrote quoting a former senior counterterrorism official when al qaeda starts creating problems in

civilians to be killed in the name of defeating terrorism the very terrorist threat that their actions are actually fueling and making worse in sum a small group of yemenis have flocked toward aqap
