a handy tip i just recently learned from the new intern on our team see you can learn something from anyone on any given day i’ve long known you could access your local drives from a remote machine start up a remote desktop dialog then expand the dialog by clicking on options then check the local resources tab make sure clipboard is checked and then hit the more… button now you can select a local disk to be shared with the remote machine for example in this case i selected my c drive as you can see the file explorer has another drive named xyz which can be used to copy files back and forth from my local machine to the remote machine but here’s the part i did not know let’s take a look at the desktop of my remote machine which has a text file named infotxt one way i can get that file to my local machine is to copy it to the mapped drive we saw in the previous screenshot or i can simply drag and drop the infotxt from my remote desktop machine to a folder on my local machine so all this time i had no idea cut and paste operations for files work across remote desktop this may be obvious for many of you but it wasn’t to me share improve this answeredited feb 1 12 at
