return to minerals database sand and gravel sand and gravel deposits found on beaches or in rivers and streams are mostly quartz silicon dioxide si o 2 grains weathering of rocks such as granite forms these quartz grains in the process of weathering the softer weaker minerals in granite such as feldspar are weathered away the more resistant quartz eventually is ground down in size but does not break down chemically in time these quartz grains accumulate in rivers streams deltas and on beaches type other industrial material description sand and gravel deposits found on beaches or in rivers and streams are mostly quartz silicon dioxide si o 2 grains weathering of rocks such as granite forms these quartz grains in the process of weathering the softer weaker minerals in granite such as feldspar are weathered away the more resistant quartz eventually is ground down in size but does not break down chemically in time these quartz grains accumulate in rivers streams deltas and on beaches relation to mining industrial sand mining methods are contingent on deposit type unconsolidated deposits are mined using frontend loaders scrapers or bulldozers material is dug excavated and pushed to a central point the oregrade material is then loaded onto a truck using standard earthmoving equipment where it then reports to a stockpile or a processing plant a hydraulic dredge uses a suction pipe to excavate the sand which is pumped through a pipeline to surge piles or directly to a processing plant the channel or tailings deposit is excavated and placed in a stockpile the oregrade material is loaded into haul trucks for transportation to a processing plant uses sand and gravel are used for road construction for mixing with asphalt as construction fill and in the production of construction materials like concrete blocks bricks and pipes it is also used to make roofing shingles used on icy roads in the winter for railroad ballast and water filtration industrial sand and gravel is used to make glass as foundry sand and as abrasive sand for some applications it is the silica content quartz of sand that makes it so valuable the silica itself is needed to make products such as glass in addition the physical properties of sand particularly its abrasive property make it useful for traction on icy roadways and railroads and for sandblasting related topics cement crushed stone aggregates teacher guide return to minerals database
