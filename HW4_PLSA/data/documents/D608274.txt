october 6 2010  419 pm  carey goldberg primer what is an aco and why should i care filed under insurance medicinescience email twitter facebook acos are hot they were the topic of a major federal meeting yesterday today they are on the agenda of the massachusetts panel that’s charged with revamping the health care payment system another state panel has already recommended heading toward them they are causing many concerns your health care organization may try to become one so what are they aco stands for “accountable care organization” from there it gets a little amorphous so amorphous that the confusion — combined with strong federal incentives to go aco — inspired this hilarious video already viewed more than 20000 times in search of an accountable care organization acoyour

things health care for her simplest most minimalist definition her response picture one system that offers and coordinates all the health care you need the most important person in the system is your primary care doctor when you need something he or she can’t provide your doctor refers you to a cardiologist or cancer specialist or eye doctor and continues working on your case with that specialist you would get all the tests you need within the same health system and go to a hospital if needed all under the same health care umbrella that’s an aco everything you need under one umbrella patients can get care outside the umbrella but it would probably cost more some patients love the idea of a “home” and someone who guides them through the health care system other patients don’t like the idea of limiting where they can go for care some doctors like and are comfortable collaborating on a patient’s care others say “team” care is unwieldy and then there are the financial challenges of making a health care system that offers all things to all people work if your eyes don’t glaze over when you hear words like “capitation” here’s an excellent briefing on acos from health affairs kaiser health news does its simpler more accessible version here at its core in the existing feeforservice payment system used by medicare and most private insurers doctors get paid more by giving more services and hospitals make more by increasing admissions with acos doctors and hospitals would get paid based on their ability to hold down overall costs and meet qualityofcare indicators in effect their pay would be based on improving care not driving more of it if the acos fail to meet certain quality and cost savings targets the providers in the aco would face lower payments from medicare on the flip side the acos would also be awarded for keeping patients happy and meeting national quality standards such as making sure diabetics get regular foot exams and women get their annual mammograms in effect acos are an attempt to buid integrated health systems like the mayo clinic where none exist but mayo took several decades to become a global destination for health care the studies of acos called for in the congressional proposals aim to see if one can be formed in a year or two here’s yet another take from today’s huffington post dr paul grundy ibm’s director of health care technology and strategic initiatives writes in acos doctors are accountable for improving the health of their patients acos tap into existing communities of physicians and other health professionals in order to build a stronger team culture in these practices doctors are rewarded for meeting targets that improve outcomes and lower costs their benchmarks are set to regional not national standards so that local factors impacting health can be taken into account and he adds i am eager to see the results from the pilot studies now underway i believe the aco concept allied with the medical home model has the potential to transform u s health care note this primer is a work in progress contributions in comments welcomenewer post daily rounds waiver nation zero tolerance for

to administer these programs any time the government steps in to our lives it cost more money let people have access to health insurers all across the country not just in the state that will being down cost ecs • 6 years ago drs are going to win either way with open insurance they over treatwith acos they under tereat doctors are the problem they choose who gets treatment and who doesnt they play god ed • 6 years ago acosmore bonuses to dr and clinics  less care for the patients  i know its what im going through right now drs just refuse to treat you so they get a bonus its all bullllllllrandygrenier • 6 years ago i think whats important is that new payment models are emerging doctors and practices will get paid for overall quality of care rather than fee for service care quality would be measured by various criteria documented in the electronic health records if this can be made feasible it would definitely be in the best interest of the consumer richard • 6 years ago aco this is just a new moniker for an already tried and failed concept hmo why do you think so many are so fed up with obamacare and that entire concept instead of improving the quality of care they are destroying it the whole idea of keeping down costs leads to the rationing of health care plain and simple the only ones in favour of this garbage are the idiots in academia who dont have the wherewithall to make it in private practice admin • 6 years agoobamacare at the right calls it is not responsible for the healthcare crisis int his country nor is it responsible for homs  youd have to go back to nixon for that one neither would i say that most academics are in favor of hmo models somply because most intelligent people with an interest can easily make themselves aware of the facts both here and internationally the plain truth is that the us does not fair even remotely well in relation to other oecd nations in the delivery or care the preservation of the health of its citizens or the management of cost study after study has found that profit incentives in the system are chiefly responsible for deterioration in the quality of service and the resultant poor statistical markers darrylhenry • 7 years ago paul grundy grinds on as if there were some expertise there from my personal experience sand first hand knowledge u s health care is nearly as good as it can be with the single exception of conerns regarding how much one makes vice how much personal integrity is demonstrated all of us have been taught and i believe completely that the skills i have are best used not for my own personal gain although i am entitled to reward for all my hard work i guess that means  i have to call into discussion what a reward ispaul grundy • 7 years ago as it is structured now the u s health care system has been failing us for years u s life expectancy continues to fall behind other countries despite spending the most on health care the united states continues to lag behind

consumer because  lets face it  thats all i really care about right now im in an hmo and my pcp makes referrals and i go where she tells me and pay extra for outofnetwork providers so it seems like an aco would be the same thing what i really need is someone to pay for my massage therapist gym membership and overpriced organic glutenfree cornflakes anybody gonna do that no i didnt think so fcv • 6
