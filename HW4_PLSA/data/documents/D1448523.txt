by the phoenician colony of carthage in around 600bc where it had become a strong power in western mediterranean region their wealth was built on trade in products got from tropical africa across the sahara the phoenicians relied on berber pastoralists of the atlas mountains as intermediaries the berbers had long been in contact with the other small groups of berbers who settled along a certain lines of oases that stretched across the sahara desert to the tropical west africa this kept communication linkage between the berbers from the north sahara berbers and the tropical africans they used two wheeled horsedrawn vehicles called chariots and packoxen in transporting products across the desert the trade routes in this trade passed from fezzan through ahaggar mountains to gao in the south the second route was in the went from morocco to mauritania at akjoujt and titchitt major charioteers are said to have been the garamantes who lived in fezzan and raided to the south the main items traded at this time included salt cloth beads metal goods from north africa in exchange for west african gold ivory and slaves this trade saw the coming of romans who developed deeper interest in the trade across sahara their main imports included ivory ostrich feathers and furs which came from animals that were still found in the north side of the desert however the romans did little to stimulate the trade right across the sahara until 300 a d the use of chariots packoxen donkeys and horses had been proved ineffective in 3rdc and 4th c there was introduction of the camels among the berbers which revolutionized the scope and scale of the trade the camels were resistant to hardships across the desert compared to parkoxen or horses 1it could carry goods that weighed over 100 kg of goods and travel over a hundred kilometers in a single day and lasted over ten days without fresh water with the introduction of camels experienced traders were able to reach distant oases and settlements by moving long distances across the desert the desert transport mainly remained in the hands of the berber nomads the principal berbers involved were the sanhaja in the west and the tuareg in the central and south of sahara the tuareg were different from the zenata berbers from the north with their custom of wearing veils to cover the lower part of their face the origin of veils is not well known but presumably it provided protection from desert winds and sandstorms the berbers mainly kept flocks of sheep goats camels and occasional cattle and horses to wealthier people and this was a symbol of social status sahara was the main territory of the berbers where they harvested date palms with the introduction of camels in the trade new trade routes and centers were founded these included the eastern routes that ran from gaotadmekka ghatto fezzan there was tripolifezzanto kanem there was that from gao to tadmekka to tunis gaotadmekkaghatto qayrawn in the west there was kombi saleh akjoujtfes and kombi salehtaghaza sijilmasa consequences of the transsaharan trade the trans saharan trade involved traveling long distances from tropical africa through sahara dessert to north africa many people and animals lost their lives on their way to the north due to shortage of water heat and sandstorms the profitability of this trade led to the rise of powerful kingdoms in west africa some communities that are known to have participated in this trade such as soninke in ancient ghana mandika in mali accumulated a lot of wealth to ensure their influence in maintaining the trade they annexed the neighboring communities in such for a wide place where to exploit gold and other commodities there was wide spread of instabilities in the region where these commodities were collected from this was due to constant raids in search for gold and slaves where many people were displaced others taken as slaves that were needed by north africans there was development of strong trade centers such trade centers included kumbisaleh gao tadmekka fezzan taghaza walata ghat etc they became commercial and administrative centers where goods were exchanged and administrative headquarters situated as the trade intensified infrastructures were developed in form of trade roots schools mosques and monuments all of these led to cultural exchanges between the arabs from north africa and the people from western sudan the trans saharan trade is said to have facilitated the spread of islam religion in western sudan the major participants in this trade were the muslim barbers and the arabs from north africa along mediterranean region these came with their cultures that were superior to that of the natives islamic doctrines were widely spread and accepted as a medium of communication in commercial transactions as well as a belief the trade further acted as an engine of growing robbery and theft in the saharan region robbers hijacked charioteers and caravans of camels that carried goods from the south goods were normally robbed off from the traders and at times they were killed this trade was responsible for the disappearance of some animals in saharan region these animals were killed in search for ivory ostrich feathers furs and animals that provided these products were wiped out of this region among which included elephants rabbits ostrich birds etc there was also intense suffering and starvation in the regions where these products were got from the local leaders in pursuit of gaining maximum profits from this trade they made sure that they collected a lot of goods using forceful means like forced labor accompanied by torture in their collection last but not least there was massive reduction of people through raiding in such of slaves that were severely wanted in north of africa and later in southern europe this led to rampant displacement of people from their respective areas and moved southwards in such for safety many people were captured and sold as slaves to barber traders who transported them to the north which in later years attracted the attention of the outsiders like people from europe and americas to come and participate in this trade which gave it a different and alarming dimension to be continued the transsaharan tradelast updated jan 18 2012add vote share via googleshare via email report story link to comment report comment
