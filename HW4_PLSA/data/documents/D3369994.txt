votrient works votrient is not a chemotherapy drug but one of many targeted therapies targeted therapy is the result of about 100 years of research dedicated to understanding the differences between cancer cells and normal cells to date cancer treatment has focused primarily on killing rapidly dividing cells because one feature of cancer cells is that divide rapidly unfortunately some of our normal cells divide rapidly too causing multiple side effects targeted therapy is about identifying other features of cancer cells scientists look for specific differences in the cancer cells and the normal cells this information is used to create a targeted therapy to attack the cancer cells without damaging the normal cells thus leading to fewer side effects each type of targeted therapy works a little bit differently but all interfere with the ability of the cancer cell to grow divide repair andor communicate with other cells there are different types of targeted therapies defined in three broad categories some targeted therapies focus on the internal components and function of the cancer cell the targeted therapies use small molecules that can get into the cell and disrupt the function of the cells causing them to die there are several types of targeted therapy that focus on the inner parts of the cells other targeted therapies target receptors that are on the outside of the cell therapies that target receptors are also known as monoclonal antibodies antiangiogenesis inhibitors target the blood vessels that supply oxygen to the cells ultimately causing the cells to starve votrient is designed to block tumor cell growth in several ways votrient targets several proteins called tyrosine kinases on the surface of cancer cells as well as targets within the cell several of these targets are thought to be involved in angiogenesis making of blood vessels by blocking these targets it is hoped the cancer will shrink research continues to identify which cancers may be best treated with targeted therapies and to identify additional targets for more types of cancer note we strongly encourage you to talk with your health care professional about your specific medical
