closest potentially habitable planet to our solar system found by ashley strickland cnnupdated 1154 pm et wed august 24 2016just watchedearthlike planet discovered orbiting suns neighbor replay must watchearthlike planet discovered orbiting suns neighbor 0053story highlights scientists have found the closest exoplanet to earth liquid water could exist on the surface of proxima b cnn in a discovery that has been years in the making researchers have confirmed the existence of a rocky planet named proxima b orbiting proxima centauri the closest star to our sun according to a new study it is the closest exoplanet to us in the universe given the fact that proxima b is within the habitable zone of its star meaning liquid water could exist on the surface it may also be the closest possible home for life outside of our solar system the researchers said because of its location the researchers hope it provides an opportunity for possible robotic exploration in the coming centuries this artists impression shows a view of the surface of the planet proxima b the good news is that it is so close study author ansgar reiners said it is not only nice for having it in our neighborhood but its a dream come true for astronomers if we think about followup observation read hate your job nasa wants you to work on mars proxima centauri coexists with a binary star in alpha centauri a wellstudied star system that serves as a neighbor to our sun proxima b is a mere 42 lightyears away from our solar system or 266000 times the distance between the earth and the sun which are 9296 million miles apart previous rocky exoplanet discoveries like those orbiting ultracool red dwarf star trappist1 were previously described as close at 40 lightyears away its not only the closest terrestrial planet found its probably the closest planet outside our solar system that will ever be found because there is no star closer to the solar system than this one said lead study author guillem angladaescudé the only thing you can hope to find between that is planet nine but that would require a solar system object or a brown dwarf that hasnt been discovered researcher pedro amado

unlike a gas giant such as jupiter  that is 13 times the size of earth and orbits its star every 112 days it is in a close orbit of proxima centauri only 5 of the distance between the earth and the sun they are even closer together than mercury and the sun but because its star is much cooler and fainter than our sun proxima b has a temperature that is suitable for liquid water to exist on the surface without evaporating researchers estimate that if the planet has an atmosphere which could be assumed but isnt known it may be between 86 to 104 degrees fahrenheit 31 to 40 degrees celsius on the surface without an atmosphere it could be 22 to 40 degrees fahrenheit 30 to 40 degrees celsius to put that in perspective earth would be 4 degrees 20 degrees celsius if it didnt have an atmosphere reiners said given the proximity to its star proxima b is also subject to less pleasant factors like ultraviolet and xray flares that are 100 times the intensity of what earth receives from the sun in the paper researchers estimated it to be 400 times the intensity but recent research has caused them to create a new estimate they said if there is life on the planet it would be affected by this radiation but it is pure speculation as to what kind of effect this infographic compares the orbit of the planet around proxima centauri proxima b with the same region of the solar system what took so long if the alpha centauri system is wellstudied and proxima centauri is our suns cozy star neighbor in the universe why did it take so long to find proxima b it comes down to an understanding of the star this planet orbits as well as how data collection has evolved during the last 16 years proxima centauri is a lowmass red dwarf star known as an mclass dwarf that happens to be close to the bright binary star alpha centauri ab which outshines its cool stepbrother so to speak all of these stars are within the faint centaurus constellation which cant be seen with the unaided eye taking a closer look at new earthlike planets for the first time mclass dwarves are not well understood in comparison with other types of stars reiners said because of that researchers dont know much about the history of these stars or their radiation in the early days but within the field of exoplants researchers have recently realized that looking for planets around m dwarves is what is going to be the most spectacular because you can find these plants in the liquid water zone more easily than other stars reiners said nasas k2 mission finds more than 100 new planets because its an active star proxima centauri can behave in varied ways that mimic the presence of a planet according to the study researchers wanted to observe it for a long period of time so for the first half of this year telescopes around the world were pointed at proxima centauri the researchers looked for a doppler wobble or back and forth wobble of proxima centauri that would be caused by the gravitational pull of a planet in orbit this was combined with research data and published studies of proxima centauri dating to 2000 the significance of the detection went sky high angladaescudé said statistically there was no doubt we have found a planet around proxima centauri what we dont know exoplanet hunter seeks life on other worlds the research around proxima b will continue and the researchers have more questions they want to answer they dont know whether there is water on the surface or if the planet has an atmosphere although both are likely they also dont know whether like earth the planet has a protective magnetic field to help with some of the radiation it receives perhaps one of the biggest questions includes the history of the star and the planet how did they form what happened during the formation reiners asked was the star more active than the sun is today and where during that phase was proxima b located this would indicate whether the plant was rich with water in its early days or started out dry as well as whether there was any highenergy radiation that could have blasted away an atmosphere during formation of the planet a view of the southern skies over the eso 36meter telescope at la silla observatory in chile with images of the stars proxima centauri lower right and the double star alpha centauri ab lower left there is also some debate over whether this planet is earthlike which comes with some connotations depending on its formation perhaps it could be like venus learning the answers to these questions about formation are possible with research the habitability of a planet like proxima b is also a matter of intense debate according to the study due to arguments against it tidal locking strong stellar magnetic fields strong flares and high ultraviolet and xray fluxes but as they point out none of those has been proved definitive either growing excitement researchers have long looked to alpha centauri for study now they want us to go there programs like mission centaur intend to design and build a space mission with a small telescope to point at the star system it would look for exoplanets by imaging or other techniques that could find more of them around these three stars given how long it took us to confirm proxima b and the fact that the researchers encountered a puzzling extra signal in some of their data and models its entirely possible that there are more planets to be found it is also the target of the starshot project which aims to create and send ultrafast lightdriven nanocraft that would reach the system 20 years after launch and beam home images this is on the list of breakthrough initiatives an effort whose board includes stephen hawking and mark zuckerberg join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter because proxima b exists outside our solar system it doesnt change our wellknown roster of planets and we know some of you are still rather upset over pluto but it does add to the field of exoplanet research thats underway some of which hopes to identify earthlike planets that future telescopes such as the james webb space telescope and the european extremely large telescope can use for observation many researchers hope that we can actually image these planets in the future getting an idea of their atmospheric makeup and surface composition and strive to answer the question of are we alone in the universe we know that there are terrestrial planets around stars the excitement is because its the nearest one and we expect to characterize it and maybe visit in a couple of centuries angladaescudé said content by lending tree experts are urging americans to refinance in 2018pay off your house with this insane trick how much
