sullenberger have as a pilot for 42 years ive been making small regular deposits in this bank of experience education and training and on january 15 the balance was sufficient so that i could make a very large withdrawal sullenberger told 60 minutes in researching the sully true story we discovered that he learned to fly at age 16 in a aeronca 7dc taking off from an airstrip near his home he entered the u s air force academy in 1969 and was ranked his classs top flyer at graduation he served as a fighter pilot in the air force between 1975 and 1979 he reached the rank of captain and

consulting firm safety reliability methods which has assisted the ntsb in investigating several plane crashes the observercom a young chesley sully sullenberger in his 1973 air force academy senior class photo right and as an air force fighter pilot left did canada geese really take out both engines yes factchecking the sully movie reveals that the flight data recorder registered the plane at an altitude of 2818 feet when the 66ton airbus a320 lost both engines after flying into a flock of canada geese at roughly 100 seconds into the flight passengers could hear a colossal bam when the birds were sucked into the engines flames could be seen coming from the left engine  miracle of the hudson plane crash documentary how long was the plane in the air the plane which was bound for charlotte north carolina was in the air for approximately five minutes and twenty seconds after taking off from new york citys la guardia airport and crash landing in the hudson river there were 208 seconds from when the us airways flight 1549 jet sucked geese into its engines at 2818 feet above la guardia to the moment when sully brought the craft down onto the hudson  nypostcom  while gliding captain sully circled once over the hudson river to help the passengers prepare for the water landing it was very quiet as we worked my copilot and i we were a team the real sullenberger recalled but to have zero thrust coming out of those engines was shocking  the silence  the observer  does video exist of the miracle on the hudson crash landing yes technically it was a controlled water landing as tom hanks character emphasizes in the movie the coast guard released a miracle on the hudson crash landing video that shows the plane descending into the hudson river at 331pm on january 15 2009 watch the sully crash landing video us airways flight 1549 becomes visible on the left side of the screen just after the 200 minute mark of the video the camera zooms in on the plane which is seen floating downriver in the frigid water as the survivors step out onto the wings hitting the water is hard the real sully told 60 minutes anchor katie couric who plays herself in the sully movie it was a hard landing and then we scooted along the surface for some point and then at some point the nose finally did come down as the speed decreased and then we turned slightly to the left and stopped a security camera captures flight 1549 seconds after captain sully landed the plane on the hudson river how fast was the plane really sinking pilot sullenberger and copilot jeff skiles didnt have enough time to go through the entire crash landing checklist the ditch button which seals the planes vents and outlets from taking on water was never pressed that coupled with the fact that the impact had caused a breach near the planes tail resulted in the plane rapidly taking on water as thousands of gallons of water poured in the plane began to sink by the tail the passengers would have just 24 minutes before the cabin and wings were fully submerged miracle of the hudson plane crash documentary did the passengers really fear that they were going to drown after surviving the water landing yes either that or perish from hypothermia in the freezing water of the hudson river survivor barry leonard actually thought they were under water since that was all he could see out the window as water came in and the back of the plane began to sink the passengers feared the worst and began using their cell phones to call their loved ones as they scrambled for a way out of the plane people were actually climbing over seats to get out says rob kolodjay a retired postal worker who was on flight 1549 with his son jeff miracle of the hudson plane crash documentary the 155 flight 1549 survivors scramble onto the wings the emergency inflatable exit ramps and some end up floating in the frigid water of the hudson river did sully stay in the plane to make sure no more passengers were on board yes the sully true story confirms that captain sullenberger walked the plane twice to make sure that all of the passengers had gotten out safely once outside of the plane he ushered passengers into the life rafts he then used a knife given to him by a ferry boat crew member to cut the rafts loose from the plane so that they wouldnt be pulled under as the aircraft sank abc news were the survivors rescued by new york city ferry boats yes the first boat to come to the aid of the sinking airliner was the ferry the thomas jefferson which was part of the hudsons commuter ferry services and was the closest vessel that could assist it took approximately four minutes for ferry captain vincent lombardi to reach the floating plane the ferry was not a rescue boat and its decks were nearly seven feet above the water too high for the passengers to easily climb aboard the ferrys crew used nets and rope ladders to help the survivors onto the boat more ferry boats and a smaller coast guard vessel arrived to help pull people from the fuelslick wings of the plane and the freezing water of the hudson the nypds scuba team came on the scene via helicopter focusing on survivors struggling to stay afloat in the freezing water captain sully was the last survivor to board a ferry miracle of the hudson plane crash documentary nyc ferry boats quickly come to the aid of sinking flight 1549 top the tense scene is recreated for the clint eastwood movie bottom how many lives were saved pilot chesley sully sullenberger saved all 155 lives on board 150 passengers and 5 crew when he safely landed us airways flight 1549 on the hudson river on january 15 2009 nydaily newscom did some of the passengers really suffer injuries yes my knee hit my sternum and actually cracked my sternum says survivor barry leonard  miracle of the hudson plane crash documentary  78 people were treated for injuries most were minor such as hypothermia but five were severe including a deep lshaped laceration to flight attendant doreen welshs leg depicted in the movie was sully really wracked with guilt over whether he made the right choice in landing the plane in the water not exactly at the time sully expressed very little doubt with regard to his decision the public instantly and unequivocally anointed him a hero and supersaint the movie poses that sully was privately tormented and wrought with guilt especially after the faa federal aviation administration questioned his decision which they did when was your last drink captain sullenberger have you had any troubles at home they ask tom hanks character simulations show that you could make it back to the airport another gripes in real life this process was far more drawn out and largely benign as most such questions were routine director clint eastwood is known for depicting tortured heroes see american sniper  adding controversy and personal drama to the story certainly helps to fill in the time around the threeminute water landing the sully movie was based on chesley sullenbergers book highest duty my search for what really matters which is thought to have netted the retired pilot a healthy six figures how much personal drama was injected or heightened for the story is hard to say but sullenberger himself stands by the film the story being told came from my experiences and reflects the many challenges that i faced and successfully overcame both during and after the flight he said in a statement passed along by warner bros nypostcom the real sully left and tom hanks right as captain sullenberger in the movie did sully suffer ptsd symptoms after the accident yes like in the sully movie the real chesley burnett sullenberger iii later stated that he suffered flashbacks and insomnia for several weeks after the accident  the observercom  sullenberger told 60 minutes that the moments before the crash were the worst sickening pitofyourstomach fallingthroughthefloor feeling that hed ever experienced was there really tension between sully and his wife because of the media coverage after the accident yes during our investigation into the sully movie true story we learned that captain sullenberger and his family were being hurried around the country for interviews and events early on there was some contention between us sullys wife lorraine told the oprah winfrey network because i said this is going to kill us i mean literally kill us we cant do it all i dont care who it is or what it is we need to manage it better lorraine and her husband sully at the movies wrap party left and laura linney as lorraine in the movie right did simulations really show that sully could have made it back to the airport yes but mainly only when the human factor was omitted several months after the ditching nearly two dozen emergency simulations were flown at the airbus headquarters in toulouse france four out of four simulations were successful when the pilots returned to the closest la guardia runway however in the simulations the decision to turn back was made immediately after the engines blew the simulated scenarios didnt account for the human factor essentially the 30 seconds it took to decide what to do nine more simulated attempts to land at la guardia were conducted taking into account the human factor and variables like landing at a different la guardia runway or landing with the plane more severely disabled only three of those attempts were successful in the end the faa agreed with what sullenberger stated in his book i had to be certain we could make it he wrote because it would rule out every other option and could kill who knows how many people on the ground there was no guarantee that the 70ton glider would clear manhattans skyline the wall street journal this diagram shows the planes flight path in red with the option of landing at teterboro in blue and the option of turning back to la guardia in pink or landing in the east river are the ntsb board members in the movie based on real people no the ntsb investigators were reimagined for the movie with only very loose correlations to the reallife ntsb board which included chairman deborah a p hersman member robert l sumwalt and vice chairman christopher a hart among others the real sully insisted the names be changed for the film since the movie treats the ntsb investigators as the villains of the story painting them to be more vindictive and outtogetem than they were in real life the movies three main ntsb board members charles porter ben edwards and elizabeth davis portrayed by mike omalley jamey sheridan and anna gunn have no direct reallife counterparts the film needed an antagonist and the ntsb became that villain the basic premise of the film is simply inaccurate says one source connected to the ntsb  condé nast traveler  how long did it take for the ntsb investigators to conclude that sully made the right decision to ditch the plane it took 15 months before federal crash investigators concluded that capt chesley sully sullenberger and copilot jeff skiles made the right decision to ditch the plane in the hudson river  the wall street journal  that time frame is significantly condensed for the movie until i read the script i didnt know the investigative board was trying to paint the picture that sully had done the wrong thing said director clint eastwood they were kind of railroading him into believing it was his fault and that wasnt the case at all  ewcom  miracle on the hudson copilot jeff skiles left and his onscreen counterpart aaron eckhart right how miraculous was sullys water landing to get the water landing right and not end in disaster pilot chesley sully sullenberger had to bring flight 1549 down at the perfect speed and angle if the nose was angled up too high the fuselage would take too much of the impact and the plane would break in half this could also create too much drag and slow the plane down too much sloping the plane forward would increase the speed but too much forward slope would mean the engines would hit the water first causing the plane to break up how do the miracle on the hudson survivors feel about the film of the survivors interviewed most have expressed support for the movie baltimore lawyer james hanks no relation to the movies star 73 called the trailer a fascinating inside look at how sully saved all 155 of us plus an unknown number of additional lives yet to be born to those on board its accurate pretty spoton said banker ricardo valeriano 45 of charlotte north carolina who walked away from the flight he calls a surreal moment a bad dream another passenger expressed mixed feelings after watching the trailer nydaily newscom does the real sully have any children yes the real sully and his wife lorraine have two daughters kelly and kate pictured below who were 14 and 16 at the time of the 2009 miracle on the hudson sullys wife lorraine middle addresses the media on january 16 2009 the day after the miracle on the hudson with their daughters kelly left 14 and kate right 16 by her side did controversy ensue when more than a thousand geese were caught and gassed following the crash yes in june and july of 2009 roughly a dozen workers from the united states department of agriculture wildlife services and the citys parks and recreation and environmental protection departments honed in on 17 locations across new york capturing and gassing 1235 canada geese prior to the roundup 1739 eggs had been coated with corn oil to stop the air from getting in which halts development wildlife advocates like glenn phillips executive director of new york city audubon says that there was insufficient research done to determine how many birds to kill citing that the birds that took out the engines were determined to have been migrant geese not resident geese  nytimescom  according to national geographic more than 200 people have died in bird strike accidents since 1988 further emphasizing the significance of the problem have any other planes crashed into the hudson river yes while exploring the sully true story we learned that a vintage wwii fighter plane crashed into the hudson river in may 2016 killing pilot bill gordon the cause was most likely mechanical failure  nypostcom  with regard to commercial airlines crashing into u s rivers on january 13 1982 air florida flight 90 a boeing 737 crashed into the frozen potomac river after taking off from washington national airport in virginia only five people on board survived 74 on the plane and four on the ground died including one initial survivor who perished after making sure that the other crash survivors were rescued in 1984 a popular tv movie was made about the potomac crash titled flight 90 disaster on the potomac i heard director clint eastwood had been involved in an emergency water landing is that true yes clint eastwood had been involved in an emergency water landing when he was in the military as a young man ive been involved in a water landing before he acknowledged when asked by katie couric well it was an exciting moment for a 21yearold kid but i was riding in the back of a military plane as a passenger a free flight deal coming down the pacific coast from seattle to san francisco we went in the ocean off of point reyes california it was a good water landing much like sully did the plane didnt float though we had about 30 seconds to get out of it on the wing and the water was coming up the pilot said what do you think i said i guess were going swimming they got in the cold november water and swam for the shore surviving the ditching
