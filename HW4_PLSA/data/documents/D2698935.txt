availability of published volumes • acknowledgements about the ghetto prior to world war ii onethird of the 665000 inhabitants of the city of łódź were jewish on september 8 1939 the city was aptured by the germans and renamed litzmannstadt in february 1940 a ghetto was created and in april was sealed off with wooden fences and barbed wire transports arrived from many other towns elsewhere in poland and from vienna prague berlin and other cities throughout europe including poland and luxembourg approximately 60000 inhabitants were packed into each square kilometer of the ghetto provisions were scarce and famine and disease were common the ghetto became the main jewish slavelabor camp for the nazis tailors and linen manufacturers made uniforms and civilian clothing shoemaking tannery metal electrical furniture and furrier workshops existed several political and social groups met secretly in the ghetto the health department ran hospitals pharmacies and clinics fortyfive primary religious and secular schools two high schools and one vocational school existed public kitchens were organized in schools factories and offices the ghetto also included old age homes an orphanage a courthouse and a prison starvation and disease killed many of the jews in the ghetto however the direct extermination of the jews began in 1942 with many jewish victims sent to the death camp at chełmno on the ner river as a result of successive deportations the numbers of jews in the ghetto decreased to 70000 people in the second half of june 1944 as the soviet army approached the remaining inhabitants were deported to auschwitz and other concentration camps lodznames list of the ghetto inhabitants 19401944origins population registry books were kept by the judenrat of the łódź ghetto from the time of establishment of the łódź ghetto in february 1940 to just prior to its liquidation in august 1944 records were maintained by apartment address and were updated on a continuing basis in addition to the names of the residents in an apartment these records sometimes included the former addresses of the inhabitants dates of birth occupation and date of deportation or death of the individual in august 1944 the nazis dissolved the judenrat and the ghetto was liquidated thus no entries were made about the fate of those deported to auschwitz in the ghettos last days these registry books managed to avoid destruction by the germans at the time of liquidation of the ghetto it includes individuals and families who were residents of łódź before the nazi invasion and the many others who were transported to łódź before being deported on to death camps it is at once a memorial to the victims of nazi brutality and a genealogical treasure not only was the łódź ghetto the longest existing ghetto in poland but the surviving records are the most detailed of any polish ghetto after world war ii the books were placed at the jewish historical institute in warsaw poland until 1967 when they were turned over at the request of the polish government to the state archives in łódź where they now reside yad vashem with the assistance of the organization of former residents of lodz in israel was able to purchase a photocopy of the registers from the polish state archives the information in the registers was reorganized by resident name from the original organization by apartment and building and an attempt was made to edit duplicate entries the result was published in a five volume set as lodznames list of the ghetto inhabitants 19401944  the names are listed in alphabetical order with a supplement of omitted names in a fifth volume the books may be found at yad vashem and copies of the books are available at the lodz landmanshaft in israel as well as at several libraries and research institutions listed below  the alphabetic registers in the first four books were later entered by volunteers into a database format  however it is important to note that no data from the fifth volume containing data that was not otherwise included in the alphabetical compilation is contained in this online database the introduction to volume five reads this book lists those inhabitants of łódź ghetto who for technical reasons were omitted from previous publications the fifth volume contains 223 pages of 20000 additional entries in order to do a complete search these entries should not be overlooked for example although the surname schwarcberg  scwarzberg appears in the surname column in the first four volumes only 20 times this surname appears over 200 times in volume five data from volume five is now searchable online at jewish gen as of 2008 read more about the volume five dataset at httpwwwjewishgenorgdatabasespolandlodz ghetto vol5html  format of the books maintained by the statistical department of the judenrat the ghettos jewish administration the records were originally organized by ghetto address before the list was published the data were computerized and reorganized by surname and given name in alphabetical order the information in the book is organized alphabetically by surname then by given name in addition to columns for surname and given name there are column headers for “sex” “birth date” “occupation” “ghetto address” and “notes” the “notes” column includes information such as dates of changes of address notations as to deportation from the ghetto and death dates there is often information on additional items such as maiden name information for an individual is often missing in one or more columns in an effort to include all information there are many instances of an individual being listed more than once with either identical statistical information or statistical information which could lead to the conclusion that two or more entries are for an identical individual format of the database in compiling the online database information was reorganized for clarity and separated into additional data fields to allow greater searchability addresses for an individual entry were each placed into a separate field each record consists of nine fields with the following information surname in alphabetical order maiden name occasionallygiven name sex date of birth occupation usually in german also in polishghetto address apartment number notes this section may include previous address or town date of death or deportation and possibly the transport number łódź street names are listed as renamed by the germans in 19391940 to find the equivalent polish street names and a key to comparing german and polish street names see httpwwwshtetlinksjewishgenorglodzstreetshtm  the germans renamed many towns in 19391940 equivalent polish town names may be found in lodz ghetto deportations and statistics table c in august 1944 the nazis dissolved the judenrat and the ghetto was liquidated thus no entries were made about the fate of those deported to auschwitz in the ghettos last days the absence of such information is a clue in itself however especially if there is evidence the individual was still alive in 1944 in the ninth column notes german or polish abbreviations are used to denote the movements or fate of the individual as on the following chart abbreviations in lodz names german or polish english abg  date change of registration to new address ag or a g  date change of

registered in zmarl died comments this database was created by alexander avraham at yad vashem jerusalem israel alex comments the original data contains two some people say three official censusesregistrations within the ghetto between 19411944 there are even records where the year 1945 is stated that is why some inmates appear two or three times within the 242000 records sometimes one can say exactly when there is a double record for the same person sometimes not because mispellingsdistortions or differences in birth dates it seems that at the time of the data entry an attempt was made to deduplicate double registrations but obviously it did not succeed entirely we have decided to stick with the file as it is and state in a disclaimer that double entries might appear for the same person the big problem is that in the original file the records consist not of separate fields but of mere lines where the different pieces of information are separated by spaces not tabs with no mark for missing items which causes inconsistence due to similarity in the type of items ie last names and maiden names three possible sets of addresses in similar format dates for record modification deportation and death it was very difficult to structure the data in a columnfield strandard pattern that is why it took so long to compile this database one has to know by heart the geography of the ghetto street by street hospital by old age home as well as other street names and cities to decypher the abbreviations and their true meaning out of a lot of folk stories and contradicting expert advise i had to ask a lot of peoplesurvivors and to go many times to the microfilm of the original records in order to understand the logic of the actual registration on forms that changed from census to census i had to go over tens of thousands of records manually because any subsets i would select would inevitably include hundreds of exceptions i had to handle manually the notations census were made in german andor polish there are a lot of erasures illegible items and wrong entries and all of this is reflected in the digital file notations pertinent to these issues appear in the notes field mostly without translation a few persons 1520 appeared not as independent records but by mistake their data was superimposed on the last items of the previous record i made a new entry for them and made a remiza in the notes pointing to the source record they appear also in the notes of the original record itself as registered in the deportation date field there are dates 19421944 for which there is no specification of deportation type or transport no in the file since the dates coincide with the waves of akzionendeportations and since there is no other information at all one might suppose this was the date of deportation or the last date an inmate was last heard of this is why i put them in the deportation date field but there is a question mark still lingering there i trust that i succeeded to do a fairly good job now i can finally sleep well over night but i am sure it is still not 100 on the other hand i dont know if somebody else having dedicated so much time and effort over almost an year in and out would have come with better results handling the data was the easy part getting to the bottom of the reality behind every item and having it right was the really complicated thing it had haunted me ever since i had to present to foreign vips over and over and over again the łódź ghetto exhibit we had for over two years in our museum i owe a tribute of recognition to my assistent zvia fried who as a łódź native and second generation to lodz ghetto survivors supported me all along and not least to joyce field warren blatt susan king and to yaacov lozewick who nudged me continuously into getting this done thanks a lot alexander avraham examples of using this database example one below is a copy of sample entries from the book for the family “rublach” fourteen entries show up but a comparison of the data fields show that some individuals may have multiple entries the most likely explanation is that entries were made at each apartment for an individual and the data was not consolidated there are sometimes slight variations in information so that it cannot be shown conclusively that two entries are definitely for the same individual the following examples illustrate possible interpretations for the entries with the rublach surname“rublach chaim” with a date of birth of 20021882 is listed twice with an identical ghetto address of “stochen gasse 9 flat 6” however the entries are not identical — the first entry shows the additional entry of “deutchland” which could indicate that this individual was brought to the ghetto from germany and also the entry of “ausg 25342 tr 25” the abbreviation ausg25342 found on the above table indicates that he was transported to chełmno on march 25 1952 the notation “tr 25” most likely means “transport no 25“rublach chaja” has three entries — two with a date of birth of “   1922” and one with a date of birth of “26 21921 the address information is identical for the first and third entry although the notes each have different dates one indicating a date of “24343 the other “ag 10644” either change of address or transport to chełmno on that date the second entry may or may not be related to the other two“rublach ita” has two entries with the same date of birth and same address of “storchen 9” and notation for a “hamburg” address so it might be inferred that they represent two moves for the same individual the first from the storchen to the hamburg address on april 7 1944 the second for a deportation on april 13 1944“rublach mordka icek” and “rublach mordka idel” seem to refer to the same individual the dates of birth are identical as is some of the address information and the date of death a comparison of addresses and dates of movement seems to indicate a familial relationship between these individuals — storchen 9 was an address for all entries but four although two different flat numbers flat 4 and flat 6 are indicated dates of transition are also identical for example chaja approximately age 20 ita approximately age 18 liba ides approximately age 3 and mortka icek idel approximately age 40 all lived in flat 4 storchen 9 below is the results screen from

would also be retrieved for an individual whose maiden name was “rublach” example two another example of how to use this database to recreate family units may be seen in the table of the talman family below at first glance it may be difficult to determine who is related to whom however by excerpting surnames from the database and reorganizing the data back to its original format by ghetto address family units might emerge for example talmans living at ghetto address hanseaten 12talman joel icek m b 1886 of lowenstadt brzeziny occupation fuhrman driver ghetto address was hanseaten 12 gest died
