apple i pod touch 5th generation philippines price and release date guesstimate complete specifications features photos mark milan macanas 9132012at around 3 oclock this morning a few minutes after tim cook wrapped up apples keynote presentation to formally introduce i phone 5 and the new i pod line i asked tp friends on facebook this straightforward question between i phone 5 and i pod touch 5th generation which i device do you think is more interesting guess what almost all of them answered i pod touch 5th generation and really why not if it looks this hot why not you know what i havent seen one in the flesh but id say its already a tpfavorite  just like its immediate predecessor i used to think that the ultrathin i pod touch 4th generation with its front and back cameras retina display and tapered edges was already the very pinnacle of what apple can deliver in the portable media player category i remember telling myself whenever id take it out of the tp gadget vault to play a game or two apple will have a hard time trying to top this one its possible but it will be a tall order and thats the very reason why i find i pod touch 5th generation totally amazing you see the product it superseded is by no means a pushover but it managed to provide a true upgrade nonetheless simply by being better in practically all departments it sounds really simple but when you think about it very few electronics companies are able to do this with their products these days for me i pod touch 5g represents the classic never settle for the status quo apple mantra that weve come to love about the company through all those years now do we see that same spirit in the i phone 5 you tell me an i phone without the phone  steve jobs flaunting a massive 4inch display and a smaller 9pin lightning dock connector similar to that of the new i phone the gorgeous i pod touch 5g  which comes in a variety of colors namely white black yellow sky blue and pink the same colors of the matching i pod touch loop that comes with every package  packs a 5 mega pixel autofocus camera with backilluminated sensor and led flash at the back  a first in the i pod line  and another 12 mega pixel shooter infront the rear camera also takes 1080p full hd video while the one for face time video calls can record 720p hd clips this new i device comes replete with all these hardware enhancements and it still manages to be more than a millimeter thinner than the already reedthin i pod touch 4th generation it becomes even more incredible when you consider the fact that it comes with the processing power and graphics performance of i phone 4s thanks to its apple a5 chip and that it runs i os6 with most of its key features including shared photo streams via i cloud facebook integration a smarter siri and apple maps with 3d view right out of the box i pod touch 5g just like i phone 5 ships with redesigned apple earphones called ear pods that supposedly enhance music playing experience by providing a more natural fit in the ear and better acoustic quality as of writing we havent heard from any of apples authorized retailers about i pod touch 5th generations release date and pricing details in the philippines i believe though that the device will enter the country via apple store online later this month with price tag of around php 16990 for the 32gb version and php 22990 for the 64gb version again thats just the tp guesstimate tp thoughts i pod touch 5g has the word hot written all over it i think it will be another bestseller  not just because of its looks nor specs but because when you think about it its easily the most sulit new generation apple product that you can get in the market and people love getting the most bang for their buck i mean its practically a cross between the ultraexpensive i phone 4s and i phone 5  only it doesnt have phone functionality so it wont allow you to send text messages and make calls but really is that so bad ill tell you this the very first apple product that i owned and worked hard for as far as i can remember is an i pod touch i fell in love with it and i think thats one of the reasons along with purchasing a think pad why i became really interested with technology and yeah it made me an apple fan tp friends im thinking about getting one in sky blue how about you tech pinas portable media player technical specs
