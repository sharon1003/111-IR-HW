826 pm while on december 21 the shortest day of the year it rises at 713 am and sets 10 hours 20 minutes later at 533 pm sunrise  sunset with twilight in july the solar day over the course of july from bottom to top the black lines are the previous solar midnight sunrise solar noon sunset and the next solar midnight the day twilights civil nautical and astronomical and night are indicated by the color bands from yellow to gray humidity we base the humidity comfort level on the dew point as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin thereby cooling the body lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid unlike temperature which typically varies significantly between night and day dew point tends to change more slowly so while the temperature may drop at night a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night the chance that a given day will be muggy in orlando is essentially constant during july remaining within 1 of 99 throughout the highest chance of a muggy day during july is 100 on july 31 for reference on july 21 the muggiest day of the year there are muggy conditions 100 of the time while on january 30 the least muggy day of the year there are muggy conditions 7 of the time humidity comfort levels in july the percentage of time spent at various humidity comfort levels categorized by dew point dry  55°f  comfortable  60°f  humid  65°f  muggy  70°f  oppressive  75°f  miserable wind this section discusses the widearea hourly average wind vector speed and direction at 10 meters above the ground the wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages the average hourly wind speed in orlando is essentially constant during july remaining within 02 miles per hour of 58 miles per hour throughout for reference on march 10 the windiest day of the year the daily average wind speed is 94 miles per hour while on august 4 the calmest day of the year the daily average wind speed is 56 miles per hour average wind speed in july the average of mean hourly wind speeds dark gray line with 25th to 75th and 10th to 90th percentile bands the wind direction in orlando during july is predominantly out of the east from july 1 to july 4 and the south from july 4 to july 31 wind direction in july the percentage of hours in which the mean wind direction is from each of the four cardinal wind directions north east south and west excluding hours in which the mean wind speed is less than 1 mph the lightly tinted areas at the boundaries are the percentage of hours spent in the implied intermediate directions northeast southeast southwest and northwest water temperature orlando is located near a large body of water eg ocean sea or large lake this section reports on the widearea average surface temperature of that water the average surface water temperature in orlando is essentially constant

section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day the elevation of the sun above the horizon and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation the average daily incident shortwave solar energy in orlando is essentially constant during july remaining within 01 k wh of 51 k wh throughout average daily incident shortwave solar energy in july the average daily shortwave solar energy

latitude 81379 deg longitude and 98 ft elevation the topography within 2 miles of orlando is essentially flat with a maximum elevation change of 56 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 93 feet within 10 miles is essentially flat  157 feet  within 50 miles also contains only modest variations in elevation  302 feet  the area within 2 miles of orlando is covered by artificial surfaces  98  within 10 miles by artificial surfaces  94  and within 50 miles by herbaceous vegetation  32 and artificial surfaces  24  data sources this report illustrates the typical weather in orlando year round based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from january 1 1980 to december 31 2016 temperature and dew point there are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in orlando for each station the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and orlando according to the international standard atmosphere and by the relative change present in the merra2 satelliteera reanalysis between the two locations the estimated value at orlando is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between orlando and a given station the stations contributing to this reconstruction are executive airport 81 46 kilometers east orlando international airport 17 13 kilometers southeast and leesburg international airport 21 53 kilometers northwest other data all data relating to the suns position eg sunrise and sunset are computed using astronomical formulas from the book astronomical tables of the sun moon and planets by jean meeus all other weather data including cloud cover precipitation wind speed and direction and solar flux come from nasas merra2 modernera retrospective analysis this reanalysis combines a variety of widearea measurements in a stateoftheart global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50kilometer grid land use data comes from the global land cover share database published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations elevation data comes from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm published by nasas jet propulsion laboratory names locations and time zones of places

reliance on the merra2 modelbased reconstructions for a number of important data series while having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness these reconstructions 1 are based on

difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas especially small islands
