field in addition to shin splints which is the number one overuse injury in track some of the most common injuries are chondromalacia aka runners knee  this painful knee ailment occurs when the kneecap patella rubs against one side of the knee joint irritating the surface of the undersurface of the patella and causing pain runners knee is more often seen in female athletes the thinking being that a womans wider hips increase lateral forces on the kneecap patellar tendonitis aka jumpers knee when the patellar tendon which connects the kneecap the patella to the shin bone becomes inflamed an athlete has patellar tendonitis while most often seen in athletes participating in jumpingtypes of sports such as basketball or volleyball this injury is also common in track and field it can result from overuse but also when the kneecap does not move up and down ie track properly in its natural groove causing friction leading to inflammation leading to chronic pain stress fractures perhaps the ultimate overuse injury left untreated a sore spot on a bone also known as a hot spot leads to a hairline fissure in the bone which leads to a fracture which can lead to the bone completely breaking in two bottom line dont ignore and continue running when there is pain and soreness in a bone treat it while it is a hot spot three primary causes overuse is the cause of most chronic nagging injuries track  field lends itself to these problems because of the repetitive motion in most events there are several primary causes of overuse problems biomechanical imbalance running too much running on hard surfaces treatment according to laura ann christopher ms atc an athletic trainer for the university of maryland track team these types of injuries usually respond to the following types of treatment rest the best antidote for overuse injuries cross training such as pool running or other aerobic exercise that doesnt use the affected area can maintain your fitness while your child rests in order to avoid aggravating the injury and allowing it time to heal antiinflammatory medications nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications nsaids such as ibuprofen motrin® naprosyn celebrex® or similar products are typically used be sure to check with a medical care provider for the proper dosage because sometimes the most effective dose for reducing inflammation is different from the dose recommended for pain relief ice ice should definitely be applied to the inflamed area as soon after a training session as possible because the more you can ice the more quickly you will get better icing throughout the day 20 minutes out of each hour 20 minutes with ice on then a 40 minute break will promote healing icing through the whole day will lead to frostbite so ice frequently but not steadily a slightly damp paper towel will allow the cold to do its work while protecting the skin from freezer burn all of these treatments can be done by the athlete an athletic trainer or physical therapist may also use some of the following to promote healing ultrasound machine sound waves penetrate the affected area bringing deep heating which can increase circulation and decrease inflammation electrical stimulation units use low level electrical currents to provide pain relief they block pain signals to the brain or may promote the production of endorphins which are the bodys natural pain relievers these machines should only be used in athletic training rooms and physical therapy lclinics by trained professionals the improper usage of units marketed for home use can be harmful prevention overuse injuries usually occur due to a biomechanical imbalance in the way the person runs causing excess stress to one area of the body remove the imbalance and strengthen the weakness and injuries will be less likely to occur according to christopher the three most important things an athlete can do to prevent inflammation and overuse injuries are dont over train more volume is not always better training or good for your childs body ideally each athlete will find the training volume that is the most effective for her but allows her to maintain her health any increase in volume should be done gradually for example increase training volume by 5 and then take several weeks to adjust before adding more dont change training techniques abruptly in general training on softer surfaces will produce less wear and tear on a young athletes joints and bones this is good for both the short term and long term health if he loves to run and want to still be doing it later in life he needs to do what he can to preserve his joints when he is young some athletes can go back and forth between grass trails roads and tracks with no problems but if your child cant he needs to keep that in mind when planning his training wear appropriate footwear different shoes are made for different kinds of feet and varying foot placements before beginning or if she is having any foot or leg pain visit a running store to have her feet evaluated and get recommendations for running shoes that will give her the best fit and support updated april 25 2015tweet average0related
