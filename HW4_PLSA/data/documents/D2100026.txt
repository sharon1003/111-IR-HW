chapter 6chapter 6pretest question 1which of the following choices correctly matches a tool and its proper applicationa transmission electron microscopy tem to study the movement of organelles within a living celb transmission electron microscopy tem to study the surfaces of preserved cellsc light microscopy to study the internal structure of ciliad cell fractionation to study the function of specific organellese scanning electron microscopy sem to study the detailed movements of living cells questions question 1when biologist wish to study the internal ultrastructure of cells they can achieve the finest resolution by usinga a phasecontrast light microscopeb a confocal fluorescence microscopec a transmission electronic microscoped a superresolution microscopee a scanning electron microscope question 2the advantage of light microscopy over electron microscopy is thata light microscopy allows one to view dynamic processes in living cellsb light microscopy provides for higher magnification than electron microscopyc light microscopy provides for higher resolving power than electron microscopyd light microscopy provides higher contrast than electron microscopye specimen preparation for light microcopy does not produce artifacts question 3a primary objective of cell fractionation is toa separate the major organelles so that their particular functions can be determinedb sort cells based on their size and weightc separate lipidsoluble from watersoluble moleculesd determine the size of various organellese view the structure of cell membranes question 4in the fractionation of homogenized cells using centrifugation the primary factor that determines whether a specific cellular component ends up in the supernatant or the pellet isa the percentage of carbohydrates in the componentb the presence or absence of lipids in the componentc the presence or absence of nucleic acids in the componentd the size and weight of the componente the relative solubility of the component question 5which of the following correctly lists the order in which cellular components will be found in the pellet when homogenized cells are treated with increasingly rapid spins in a centrifugea chloroplast ribosomes vacuolesb nucleus mitochondria ribosomesc nucleus ribosomes chloroplastsd vacuoles ribosomes nucleuse ribosoms nucleus mitochondria question 6what is the reason that a modern electron microscope tem can resolve biological images to the subnanometer level as opposed to tent of nanometers achievable for the best superresolution light microscopea the electron microscope has a much greater ratio of image size to real sizeb the focal length of the electron microscope is significantly longerc contrast is enhanced by staining with atoms of heavy metald electron beams have much shorter wavelength than visible lighte the electron microscope cannot image whole cells at one time question 9the volume enclosed by the plasma membrane of plant cells is often much larger than the corresponding volume in animal cells the most reasonable explanation for this observation is thata plant cells are capable of having a much higher surfacetovolume ratio than animal cellsb plant cells have a much more highly convoluted folded plasma membrane than animal cellsc plant cells can have lower surfacetovolume ratios than animal cells because plant cells synthesize their own nutrientsd animal cells are more spherical whereas plant cells are elongatede plant cells contain a large vacuole that reduces the volume of the cytoplasm question 13prokaryotes are classified as belonging to two different domains what are the domainsa archaea and protistab bacteria and eukaryac bacteria and fungid bacteria and archaeae bacteria and protista question 14if radioactive deoxythymidine triphosphate d ttp is added to a culture of rapidly growing bacterial cells where in the cell would you expect to find the greatest concentration of radioactivitya endoplasmic reticulumb nucleusc robisomesd cytoplasme nucleoid question 36one of the key innovations in the evolution of eukaryotes from a prokaryotic ancestor is the endomembrane system what eukaryotic organelles or features might have evolved as a part of or as an elaboration of the endomembrane systema plasma membraneb mitochondriac chloroplastsd nuclear envelopee none of these question

the rough era endoplasmic reticulum proteinsb secreted proteinsc mitochondrial proteinsd plasma membrane proteinse extracellular matrix proteins question 64a biologist wants specifically to examine the surfaces of different types of cells in kidney tubules of small mammals the cells in question can be distinguished by external shape size and 3d characteristics which of the following would be the optimum method for her studya scanning electron microscopyb cell fractionationc transmission electron microscopyd light microscopy using stains specific to kidney functione light microscopy of living unstained material question 65a newspaper ad for a local toy store indicates that a very inexpensive microscope available for a small child is able to magnify specimens nearly as much as the much more costly microscope available in your college lab what is the primary reason for the price differencea the toy microscope usually uses a different wavelength of light sourceb the college microscope produces greater contrast in the specimensc the toy microscope magnifies a good deal but has low resolution and therefore poor quality imagesd the ad agency is misrepresenting the ability of the toy microscope to magnifye the toy microscope does not have the same fine control for focus of the specimen activity metric system review1 meter   centimetersa 1000000b 1000c 1000000000000d 1000000000e

composed of two lipid bilayersc molecules pass into and out of the nucleus through nuclear poresd nuclear pores are made up of a group of proteins that are collectively called the nuclear pore complex true or false large proteins containing a nuclear localization signal nls bind to the nuclear pore and enter the nucleus without any expenditure of energya trueb false a small protein molecular weight  25000 daltons is injected into a cell and observed in the nucleus a short time later what type of transport has taken placea osmosisb active transportc passive transport in experiments to test

to give the protein molecules energy nucleoplasmin is a nuclear protein this protein was divided into two segments and linked to the same large cytoplasmic protein generating two fusion proteins after injecting these fusion proteins into a cell one of the proteins was found in the nucleus and the other in the cytoplasm which of the following conclusions can be drawn from these resultsa one of the
