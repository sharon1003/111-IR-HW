voltage free contact voltage free contact by andrew on 16 august 2007  1110 pm how does a voltage free contact work by anonymous on 19 august 2007  852 pm1 out of 1 members thought this post was helpful this means that the relay contact will be free of voltage there is no voltage will be there in the relay contacts so you can switch to any system without any fear best of luck by anonymous on

no voltage is present on contact when it is open no voltage at all by michael griffin on 20 august 2007  1137 pm its just a relay contact or optoisolator or transistor you need to supply your own signal voltage the voltage that is present is whatever you supply by anonymous on 21 august 2007  444 pm hmm if i understand you correctly 90 of all contacts are voltage free for example if i have standard ordinary relay that has no and nc contacts all of them are voltage free right contact that is no voltage free has a built in power supply or similar by david adams on 21 august 2007  524 pm technically all contacts are voltage free until you connect them to a voltage source the term voltage free means they do not yet have a voltage connected to them so you may provide your own based upon the needs of the machine andor system involved they are typically used to isolate two machines each having its own voltage source from one another that way machine builder a does not care what voltage machine builder b uses one machine may have 24 vdc control power and the other may have 120 vac control power by michael griffin on 22 august 2007  1039 pm yes you could say that an ordinary relay has voltage free contacts you wouldnt normally phrase it that way though the term is normally used for complex devices that have relay or optoisolator or transistor outputs for example suppose you had a panel meter that turned on an output if a voltage reading were within limits if it simply provided you with access to a pair of terminals which connected directly to the contacts then these would be voltage free if however there were a 24vdc power supply inside the panel meter and one of the terminals output 24vdc when on then it wouldnt be voltage free i think you should be able to see the difference a voltage free output simply closes a switch inside a device and you have to feed a voltage into it somewhere in order to get a signal back out again this isnt a term that you would apply to a simple device like a relay it is something you would use for a complex device that has relays inside it which it uses to signal or handshake with another device there are several reasons for designing devices this way one is that this way it can be electrically compatible with a wide range of signals since you provide the voltage which is output the other reason is that it is cheaper that way since the device doesnt have to have a 24vdc power supply inside it just to provide a signal output instead they rely on you to provide that this is one of those terms which has come into use as a short hand description for a common configuration note as mentioned above that a voltage free contact isnt necessarily an actual relay it could also be a transistor or optoisolator by dude1977 on 27 march 2008  1149 pm if you had a plc and one of its inputs was connected to a running signal from a pump and the connection was a volt free contact how would the plc know that the running signal was high or low or would this situation never arise ie would volt free contacts only be used by plc output cards so that the plc could generate a signal to maybes to start the pump any help would be appreciated by michael griffin on 28 march 2008  1142 pm in reply to dude1977 a voltage free contact is just a switch you would need two wires from the plc to the pump contact if we assume the plc has sinking inputs then one wire would go to the plc input and the other would go to 24vdc or whatever the voltage is when the contact closes at the pump the plc input is connected to 24vdc and sees this as on when the contact at the pump opens the plc input is disconnected from 24vdc and sees this as off if the plc uses sourcing inputs then the second wire goes to the io card common instead of 24vdc by marcolito on 28 october 2010  718 am hmm if i understand you correctly 90 of all contacts are voltage free for example if i have standard ordinary relay that has no and nc contacts all of them are voltage free right contact that is no voltage free has a built in power supply or similar you have two circuits one for the relay coil and one which is volt free the contacts for example when the coil is 240v the relay contacts can be another voltage and circuit for example 12 v dc from another source by curt wuollet on 21 august 2007  227 pm it means that there is no voltage on the contacts open or closed unless you supply it and the whole idea is that you can use it for whatever you need within its ratings its just like a standalone relay as far as contacts are concerned these are often referred to as dry contacts as well which is a bit confusing as it is not really related to dry switchingregardscww by tom chubb on 21 august 2007  324 pm it can be used to interface with another machine that has a different voltage to the machine with the relay for example you want to give a machine running signal to the other machine so you energise the relay and use the volt free contacts to tell the other machine that the system is running hope this helps by jm on 12 march 2009  732 am voltage free contact means that the contact is free to carry whichever voltage you choose to feedsupply it with one moment you may send 5v through that contact the next moment you may send 10v through it the next moment 0v the next moment 3v etc etc etc basically the choice of voltage to be sent through that contact at any given time is free ie free choice of voltage usage through it imagine you have an actuator that opens o on o v 30 on 3v 50 on 5v 75 on 75v and 100 on 10v the moment you need the actuator to open 50 you send a signal of 5v through that volt free contact to a plc controller which in turn sends lets say for the sake of simplicity of explanation 50v to the actuator the next moment you need the actuator to open 75 so you send 75v through that voltage free contact to the same plc controller which in turn sends 75v to the actuator and so on and so forth understand now j c joao monteiro by prashant on 22 august 2007  1145 pm a voltage free contact provided on a particular contactor does not carry the syatem voltage which basically activates that particular contactors coil itself it is free to be used to control another system with different voltage obviously no contact will be voltage or potential free if it is opearting a control system your use of
