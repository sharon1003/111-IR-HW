future of our current health plans and medicare under the upcoming trump administration quinlan i am expecting that president elect trump will repeal portions of the current federal affordable care act aca sometimes called obama care in the first 100 days of his administration some political watchers predict that he will execute a “repeal and delay” strategy to immediately repeal certain portions of the aca like the current irs penalty if you do not have any health insurance under this scenario we would experience a delay in new health care reform legislation until congress passes new health provisions in 2017 or into 2018 medicare changes will also be likely be proposed in 2017 or in 2018 trump has nominated republican u s rep tom price of georgia to be head of the u s department of health and human services which regulates a large portion of our health care system price is a medical doctorsurgeon and has been a sharp critic of the affordable care act he and others in our congress have proposed major changes to medicare like raising the age of eligibility for medicare to age 66 or 67 currently at age 65 and increasing medicare premiums the bigger change to achieve more control over medicare’s rising cost growth swelling number of baby boomers and agerelated expenses for illnesses from americans would be moving away from the current “fee for service” current model under medicare parts a and b and move into more private insurance health plans like the current part c medicare advantage plans under this option called “premium support” medicare recipients would choose a private health plan and the federal government would make a predetermined contribution for medical expenses any unreimbursed balance due would be paid by the recipient this option would be of

visits and outpatient procedures quinlan your monthly premium for part b is based on your annual income the 2017 base monthly premium is 134 but not everyone is paying this amount for people who have their part b monthly premium directly deducted from their monthly social security retirement check the majority of americans choose this option these medicare recipients will pay less than the base monthly premium of 134 these people about 70 of social security recipients will be treated with a lower monthly premium under a provision called “hold harmless” in federal law the average part b premium protected by this “hold harmless” provision will be 109 if your income is equal to or below 85000 for an individual 170000 for couples the 2017 base premium is 134 if your income is between 85001 and 107000 and 170001 and 214000 for couples the 2017 premium will rise to 18750 above 214000 428000 for couples in annual income the monthly premium will be 42860 however not everyone is protected by the “hold harmless” provision this provision will not protect you you will face higher premium than the base premium if you are new to medicare enrolled in 2016 or 2017 and people already paying higherincome related premiums like those in the above paragraph in these cases you will face higher monthly premiums for your medicare part b coverage boomer what if my annual income changes
