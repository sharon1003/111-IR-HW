systematic benevolence as first proposed and adopted by the sabbathkeeping adventists in 1859 comprised a systematic plan of giving not only on a percentage basis but also freewill offerings some documentation on systematic benevolence and the tithe as launched in 1859 top of this sectionthe following plan was recommended at the january 1859 meeting in battle creek1 let each brother from 18 to 60 years of age lay by him in store on the first day of each week from five to 25 cents2 each sister from 18 to 60 years of age lay by her in store on the first day of each week from two to ten cents3 also let each brother and sister lay by him or her in store on the first day of each week from one to five cents on each and every 100 of property they possess the lowest sums stated are so very small that those in the poorest circumstances with very few exceptions of some widows infirm and aged can act upon this plan while those in better circumstances are left to act in the fear of god in the performance of their stewardship to give all the way up to the highest sums stated or even more as they see it their duty to do rh february 3 1859 p 84with only slight modification this plan was adopted at the general conference session june 4 1859 reported in rh june 9 1859 p 20 what shall be done with the money top of this sectionas churches began to respond to the plan adopted at battle creek a question arose as to the use of the money thus raised james white in the review of march 3 1859 answers the questionbrother i c vaughn writes from hillsdale michigan that the church in that place are acting on the systematic benevolence plan and like it much and inquires what is to be done with the money at the end of the month we suggest that each church keep at least 5 in the treasury to help those preachers who occasionally visit them and labor among them this seems necessary such is the scarcity of money that our good brethren very seldom are prepared to help a messenger on his journey let there be a few dollars in every church treasury beyond this the debt on the tent enterprise etc claims the proceeds of systematic benevolence in this state michigan and on january 29 1861

churches are adopting in michigan referring to his statement published in good samaritan no 5 viz they regard the use of their property worth the same as money at ten percent this ten percent they regard as the increase of their property a tithe of this would be one percent and would be nearly two cents per week on each one hundred dollars which our brethren for convenience sake are unanimous in putting down  next comes the personal donations let the young men who have no taxable property come up nobly here also the young women james white rh april 9 1861 p 164 reasons for the choice of the term systematic benevolence top of this sectionwhile the term tithe does not often occur in the presentations of the plans for systematic benevolence full documentation would indicate that the main and strongest phase of this plan was definitely based upon the tithing principle and that the steps taken two decades later were merely refinements and extensions of what was adopted in 1859 they were not two separate and distinct plans why did the term tithe not appear more prominently at the onset when the pioneers moved into the consideration of organization in the 1850s it was in the setting of gospel order they looked to the new testament for the pattern they found this largely in the appointment of the seven deacons and not in the appointment by moses of the 70 elders mrs white in 1854 opens her first full article on this subject with these words the lord has shown that gospel order has been too much feared and neglected ew 97 james white in 1853 in his first appeal to the sabbathkeeping adventists for financial support for the ministry presents it under the title gospel order he draws on the new testament for support later statements which argue for the continuation of the tithing obligation beyond the cross imply that at first it was generally assumed that the tithe responsibility ceased with the death of christ and therefore malachi 3 placed no binding claims upon the believers of our day see j n andrews in rh may 18 1869 in 1875 in pressing the matter of a tithe of onetenth of the increase see 3t 395 ellen white recognized that some will pronounce this one of the rigorous laws binding upon the hebrews 3t 396 and she declaresthe special system of tithing was founded upon a principle which is as enduring as the law of god this system of tithing was a blessing to the jews else god would not have given it them so also will it be a blessing to those who carry it out to the end of time our heavenly father did not originate the plan of systematic benevolence to enrich himself but to be a great blessing to man he saw that this system of beneficence was just what man needed 3t 404 405 consequently the strength of argument for the support of the work of god came at first from the new testament but in reckoning the obligations of the page 3believer the principle of the tithe was employed it should be noted that while systematic benevolence adopted by our forefathers was broader than the tithe it embodied the tithe ellen g white early linked the tithe with systematic benevolence first she assured the church in june 1859 the plan of systematic benevolence is pleasing to god 1t 190 and then in january 1861 in an article entitled systematic benevolence she wrote rob not god by withholding from him your tithes and offerings the article closed with malachi 3811 quoted in full 1t 221 222 the issues of the review and herald through the 1860s carried scores of articles making reference to systematic benevolence reporting on the success of the plan and giving counsel concerning its operation the plan restated in 1864 top of this sectionjames white restated the plan in november 1864 and in so doing tied it very closely with the tithethe children of israel were required to give a tithe or tenth of all their increase  and it cannot be supposed that the lord requires less of his people when time is emphatically short and a great work is to be accomplished in the use of their means in giving the last merciful message to the world says the prophet malachi 3810 quoted if the prophet malachi is not here teaching the carrying out of the israelitish system of tithing he is certainly enforcing a duty of the same nature and his words may come home to us with full force and the principle be carried out by obedience to the language of paulupon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store etc says our lord but woe unto you pharisees for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs and pass over judgment and the love of god these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone luke 1142 how may we reduce to practice these excellent suggestions we recommend the following plan which all with very few exceptions can adopt if the brethren give a tithe or tenth of their income estimating their income at ten percent on what they possess it will amount to about two cents weekly on each 100 of property besides this let all who are able so to do give a personal donation for each week more or less according to their ability this is necessary to include those who have but little or no property yet have ability to earn and should give a share of their earnings while some widows or aged and infirm should be excused from personal the young and active who have but little or no property should put down a liberal weekly personal donation  those whose income is more than ten percent on their property can pay higher in proportion to the amount of their income a tithe or tenth of their increase is just exactly onetenth of the increase of their property has a brother or sister increased his or her property during 1864 by the sum of 1000 a tithe would be just 100 review  herald november 29 1864 a plan with some defects top of this sectionwith the tithing system as with several other lines of truth which became fundamental adventist doctrine our pioneers did not see it in all its beauty and completeness at the very outset they were endeavoring to find a system of finance which harmonized with gospel order the lord led them only as fast as they could see accept and follow unfolding biblebased truth there was a gradual development in both the basis page 4for ascertaining the obligations of the believer and the precise use to which this revenue of the gospel should be put the large need was the support of the ministry and the funds yielded by systematic benevolence which included both tithes and offerings were channeled almost exclusively toward ministerial support except for publishing house employees and after 1866 sanitarium workers who were supported from the incomes of the institutions all was in ministerial lines there were many references to systematic benevolence and the tithe through the late 1860s and the 1870s ellen white in testimony no 24 written in 1874 and published in january 1875 devotes 28 pages to tithes and offerings followed by five pages under the title of systematic benevolence 3t 381413 in 1876 the conviction came to leading brethren that there were defects in the plan especially in the basis on which the tithe was reckoned the following comes from a special session of the general conference held early that yearremarks were then made by brother canright on the subject of systematic benevolence taking certain wellascertained facts as a basis he showed that if all would come up to the bible plan of s b the amount within our ranks would reach the sum of 150000 yearly instead of about 40000 as it now is the lord says bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse and until this is done the lord will not be proved to see whether he will not pour out a blessing so that there shall not be room enough to receive it brother white followed with lengthy and stirring remarks on the same subject brother canright offered the following resolutions on the subject of systematic benevolence which were unanimously adopted by the conference and congregation  resolved that we believe it to be the duty of all our brethren and sisters whether connected with churches or living alone under ordinary circumstances to devote onetenth of all their income from whatever source to the cause of god and further  resolved  that we call the attention of all our ministers to their duty in this important matter to set it plainly and faithfully before all their brethren and urge them to come up to the requirements of the lord in this thing  moved and carried that the chairman appoint a committee of three himself to be one of that committee to prepare a tract upon the subject of systematic benevolence the chair appointed d m canright and u smith to act with him as that committee minutes of the special session of the general conference published in rh april 6 1876 p 108 by the year 1878 a change had been made in the plan of figuring the percentage of giving or tithe shifting from approximately one percent per year to the total valuation of property to ten percent of the actual income the former plan was found to be defective in one case on the old plan the tithe amounted to 10 per month while under the new plan of an actual ten percent of income the tithe amounted to 36 per month the perfected plan delineated in an 1878 pamphlet top of this sectionaccording to conference action the perfected plan was set before the believers in a pamphlet significantly bearing the title systematic benevolence or the bible plan of supporting the ministry it was but a refinement with a better way of figuring the tithe and the presentation page 5made under the familiar title of systematic benevolence in the introductory statement in the pamphlet we readthe subject of systematic benevolence has been under practical consideration by seventhday adventists for a period of twenty years or more and no material changes from the system first adopted were seen necessary until two years since the reasons for these changes are given in the pages that follow how much ought i to give for the support of the gospel after carefully viewing the subject from all points we answer a tithe of all our income this does not mean a tenth of our annual increase of property after the cost of food and clothing and other expenses are paid but that nine parts of our income are to meet all these expenses while a tithe of our income is the lords to be sacredly devoted to the support of the ministry we regard the plan of pledging a sum equal to one percent annually on our property defective in several respects1 it does not give a tithe of our income  it is our conviction that our people have robbed god of more than onehalf of the tithes which are his while acting upon the defective plan of paying s b to the amount of only one percent per annum on their property2 the words of paul touching this subjectas the lord hath prospered himare in strict harmony with that system in the old testament which claims onetenth of all the income of the lords people as his the following we regard as a scriptural and proper pledge for all our people to makewe solemnly promise before god and to each other conscientiously to pay to the systematic benevolence treasurer a tithe of all our income to be laid by when received and paid on the first sunday of each one of the four quarters of the year namely the first sunday in january the first sunday in april the first sunday in july and the first sunday in october 3 by the defective plan those who had little or no property and at the same time had considerable income in some cases robbed the lord of nearly or quite all the tithes of their actual income by the bible plan one dollar of every ten earned is secured to the lords cause this alone will make a difference of many thousands to be cast into the lords treasury for the support of the cause of god and we cannot see reasons why our institutions such as publishing houses schools sanitariums and state conferences should not put into the treasury of the lord a tithe of all their income these are indebted to the lord and his servants for their existence and prosperity as these receive the support of the general conference their tithes should be put into the general conference treasury the annual sum to be collected from our institutions at battle creek alone would not be less than 4000 a handsome sum indeed to cast into a treasury which is not only empty but actually in debt and if our state conferences also pay a tithe of their income into the general conference treasury a want will be supplied that has long been felt  statement prepared by committee appointed at general conference october 213 1878 committee as follows james white d m canright s n haskell j n andrews uriah smith systematic benevolence or the bible plan of supporting the ministry the developing concept of the proper use of the tithe top of this sectionnot only was there a development in the understanding of what constituted a page 6proper tithe but there was also a development in an understanding of the use to which it should be put the pattern of history in this matter is akin to that of other developments among us the lord did not at the outset through vision to ellen white decree every detail rather he led our forefathers to the scriptures as a basis of a church financial system first to the new testament and then to the old when the plan of gospel finance was adopted in the late 1850s the lines of church work were limited there were those engaged in ministerial labors and there was the publishing work the publishing work was supported by the sale of literature and by freewill gifts as the sanitarium work was begun in 1866 a stock company was formed and at the outset it seemed that this enterprise would be a moneymaking concern yielding no less than ten percent on the investment the medical work although not so lucrative as it first seemed it would be was not the recipient of systematic benevolence nor did the school look to this source for finance as our educational work was started in the early 1870s the three very early attempts at church school work were before the days of systematic benevolence and they looked to tuition for their support this was true also with the school that bell started in battle creek in the late 1860s the school started in battle creek in 1872 with general conference support was on a tuition basis the only school in operation before the 1878 actions reorganizing systematic benevolence was battle creek college it was not until 1882 that healdsburg college and south lancaster academy were started and there is no hint that they drew in any way on systematic benevolence or tithe funds in fact the demands of the ministerial lines of work pressed hard on the systematic benevolence funds as the record shows no segregation of funds top of this sectionthe systematic benevolence funds provided for the cause were not divided by the giver or the local church into strictly tithe funds and nontithe funds offerings nor were they in any manner separated in the account books of the conferences or general conference the spirit of prophecy counsels repeatedly call for a faithfulness that the treasury be constantly replenished but prior to 1880 the instruction does not delineate precisely how systematic benevolence funds should be used nor impose the restrictions presented in later years james white in the review of november 29 1864 argues strongly for all of the systematic benevolence funds to be placed in the local or general conference treasuries to support the proclamation of the third angels message this he maintains was the original design for our plan of benevolence and we regard it as a very great error in departing from it in any degree he recognized however that there were exceptions and that some of these funds could properly be used locally for expenses other than the support of the ministrythose churches that have to build houses of worship and meet the expenses of lights fuel etc and do not feel able to come up to the figures of our illustration of systematic benevolence besides can at their annual meeting appropriate by vote such a percent of their entire systematic benevolence funds to such objects as they think proper but it is supposed that the page 7instances where such a course would be necessary would be very few rh november 29 1864 with the restudy in 1878 and the adoption of the plan of figuring the tithe on the total income the treasuries were better supplied and the uses to which systematic benevolence funds should be put became a matter of study and discussion ellen whites 1879 statement top of this sectionlate in 1879 ellen white penned the article on sacredness of vows now in testimonies vol 4 pp 462476 in this she makes several references to tithes and liberal offerings as a means of supporting various facets of the work of the church1 institutionsselfishness and fraud are practiced daily in the church in withholding from god that which he claims thus robbing him and conflicting with his arrangements to diffuse the light and knowledge of truth throughout the length and breadth of the land god in his wise plans has made the advancement of his cause dependent upon the personal efforts of his people and upon their freewill offerings by accepting the cooperation of man in the great plan of redemption he has placed a signal honor upon him the minister cannot preach except he be sent the work of dispensing light does not rest upon ministers alone every person upon becoming a member of the church pledges himself to be a representative of christ by living out the truth he professes the followers of christ should carry forward the work which he left for them to do when he ascended into heaven institutions that are gods instruments to carry forward his work on the earth must be sustained churches must be erected schools established and publishing houses furnished with facilities for doing a great work in the publication of the truth to be sent to all parts of the world these institutions are ordained of god and should be sustained by tithes and liberal offerings as the work enlarges means will be needed to carry it forward in all its branches those who have been converted to the truth and been made partakers of his grace may become coworkers with christ by making voluntary sacrifices and freewill offerings to him and when the members of the church wish in their hearts that there would be no more calls for means they virtually say that they are content that the cause of god shall not progress 4t 464 the plan of systematic benevolence was of gods own arrangement but the faithful payment of gods claims is often refused or postponed as though solemn promises were of no significance it is because church members neglect to pay their tithes and meet their pledges that our institutions are not free from embarrassment if all both rich and poor would bring their tithes into the storehouse there would be a sufficient supply of means to release the cause from financial embarrassment and to nobly carry forward the missionary work in its various departments god calls upon those who believe the truth to render to him the things that are his 4t 475 4762 the gospel ministry and the printed pagein commissioning his disciples to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature christ assigned to men the work of spreading the gospel but while some go forth to preach he calls upon others to answer to his claims upon them for tithes and offerings with which to support the ministry and to page 8spread the printed truth all over the land this is gods means of exalting man it is just the work which he needs for it will stir the deepest sympathies of his heart and call into exercise the highest capabilities of the mind  4t 472 what proportion of income and possessions top of this sectionin this same article in dealing with the demands upon israel for benevolence ellen white wroteaccording to the amount bestowed will be the amount required the larger the capital entrusted the more valuable is the gift which god requires to be returned to him if a christian has ten or twenty thousand dollars gods claims are imperative upon him not only to give his proportion according to the tithing system but to present his sin offerings and thank offerings to god the levitical dispensation was distinguished in a remarkable manner by the sanctification of property when we speak of the tithe as the standard of the jewish contributions to religious purposes we do not speak understandingly the lord kept his claims paramount and in almost every article they were reminded of the giver by being required to make returns to him they were required to pay a ransom for their firstborn son for the first fruits of their flocks and for the first gatherings of the harvest they were required to leave the corners of their harvest fields for the destitute whatever dropped from their hands in reaping was left for the poor and once in every seven years their lands were allowed to produce spontaneously for the needy then there were the sacrificial offerings the trespass offerings the sin offerings and the remission of all debts every seventh year there were also numerous expenses for hospitalities and gifts to the poor and there were assessments upon their property at stated periods in order to preserve the integrity of the law the people were interviewed as to whether they had faithfully performed their vows or not a conscientious few made returns to god of about onethird of all their income for the benefit of religious interests and for the poor these exactions were not from a particular class of the people but from all the requirement being proportioned according to the amount possessed besides all these systematic and regular donations there were special objects calling for freewill offerings such as the tabernacle built in the wilderness and the temple erected at jerusalem these drafts were made by god upon the people for their own good as well as to sustain his service  4t 467 468 our work needs tenfold more top of this sectionof all our income we should make the first appropriation to god in the system of beneficence enjoined upon the jews they were required either to bring to the lord the first fruits of all his gifts whether in the increase of their flocks or herds or in the produce of their fields orchards or vineyards or they were to redeem it by substituting an equivalent how changed the order of things in our day the lords requirements and claims if they receive any attention are left till the last yet our work needs tenfold more means now than was needed by the jews the great commission given to the apostles was to go throughout the world and preach the gospel this shows the extension of the work and the increased responsibility resting upon the followers of christ in our day if the law required tithes and offerings thousands of years ago how much more essential page 9are they now if the rich and poor were to give a sum proportionate to their property in the jewish economy it is doubly essential now the majority of professed christians part with their means with great reluctance many of them do not give onetwentieth of their income to god and many give far less than that while there is a large class who rob god of the little tithe and others who will give only the tithe if all the tithes of our people flowed into the treasury of the lord as they should such blessings would be received that gifts and offerings for sacred purposes would be multiplied tenfold and thus the channel between god and man would be kept open the followers of christ should not wait for thrilling missionary appeals to arouse them to action if spiritually awake they would hear in the income of every week whether much or little the voice of god and of conscience with authority demanding the tithes and offerings due the lord  4t 474 by 1880 it was the general understanding that such as funds came from the tithe should be devoted exclusively or nearly so to the support of the gospel ministry note this from james whitethe tithe is the lordssince the fall of man it has been necessary that there should be men devoted wholly to the service of god it appears that from the beginning the lord taught his people to devote onetenth to the support of his ministers  review  herald january 15 1880 in 1880 some local churches must have been drawing upon tithe funds for church expenses at least this is implied in an action taken on october 6 at the general conference session resolved that no church should devote any portion of the tithe to the erection or repairing of its church without the free consent of the state conference committee  review  herald october 14 1880 the church was feeling its way while it had been the general understanding that tithe funds should be reserved for the gospel ministry the demands of a growing work and increased resources at hand led to a more liberal stance and one which was defended by the president of the general conference george i butler wrote a pamphlet which carries no date but gives evidence of having been published in 1884previous to 1878 we tried to carry out a plan called systematic benevolence each person estimated the value of his property ten percent of which was reckoned as its income and onetenth of this latter was the tithe he was to pay on his property personal weekly donations were given besides this was as its name implies systematic benevolence but it was far from being the same as a bible tithe the tithe is in no sense benevolence it is not ours to give but the lords all the time the matter of the tithe was brought before the general conference in october 1878 and a committee of five three appointed to prepare a work on this subject our people then generally accepted the tithing principle theoretically and have practiced it to a certain extent ever since  the tithing system p 69 on pages 71 and 72 elder butler deals with the use of the tithematters in the cause are assuming a new phase new demands upon us in the line of laborers are coming in more and more and certainly the time is reached when we ought to be honest with god and give him his own then in pointing out that page 10which makes this necessary he makes this statementuntil within a few years past the tithe has been used almost wholly for sustaining ministers of the gospel those who preach from the stand in some way it seemed to be universally understood that no others were entitled to any of the tithe but more recently it has become customary to pay our tract and missionary state secretaries from the tithe and our auditing committees have settled with them the same as ministers it has taken in many cases considerable argument to bring this about with the last year or two another class has also been laboring in the cause and the question has been raised how shall these be paid we refer to the colporteurs and missionary workers of different classes laboring in field or in city missions these have in many cases been paid from the tithe but in several instances it has been a heavy strain upon the treasury and in some cases the ministry have not had a reasonable support because of this the question has come to the front in a manner so forcible that it must be met and settled many can labor as effectively in the missionary work as colporteurs and laborers as those who preach from the desk many no doubt will canvass and pay their way by the profits on sales but there are many others who cannot be supported in this way whose labors are necessary to carry the truth how shall these be sustained after giving the matter much reflection we have settled the question in our own mind we believe that tithing is designed of god for the support as far as it will go of all laborers who are called by the cause of god to give their time to this work we know of no other special system for this purpose  g i butler in an examination of the tithing system from a bible standpoint pp 71 72 notice that church school teachers are not mentioned we had no organized church school program at this time to what extent the opinions expressed by elder butler may have been incorporated into the policies of the church is a matter which could be investigated there was a discussion of the wider use of tithe at the general conference committee on october 13 1896 at the fall session we quote from the minuteselder breed asked advice with reference to the counsel which should be given churches in regard to use of the tithe for church debts and expenses it was shown that while it was quite generally the custom of our churches to keep their tithe in the regular channelthe support of the ministryyet in some instances especially among two or three of the largest churches in the denomination the usual practice in this respect was not being followed the members of the committee expressed regret that such was the condition of things and suggested that steps should be taken to remedy the evil as quickly as possible  general conference committee october 13 1896 the record makes clear that in the mid1890s the lord through his messenger gave specific directions calling for a strict policy relating to the use of the tithe this came in a communication written from cooranbong new south wales on march 14 1897 it was published by the general conference in a 39page tract may 21 1897letters have come to me from oakland and battle creek making inquiries as to the disposition made of the tithe the writers supposed that they were authorized to use the tithe money page 11in meeting the expenses of the church as these expenses were quite heavy from that which has been shown me the tithe is not to be withdrawn from the treasury every penny of this money is the lords own sacred treasure to be appropriated for a special use there was a time when there was very little missionary work done and the tithe was accumulating in some instances the tithe was used for similar purposes as is now proposed when the lords people felt aroused to do missionary work in home and foreign missions and to send missionaries to all parts of the world those handling sacred interests should have had clear sanctified discernment to understand how the means should be appropriated when they see ministers laboring without money to support them and the treasury is empty then that treasury is to be strictly guarded not one penny is to be removed from it ministers have just as much right to their wages as have the workers employed in the review and herald office and the laborers in the pacific press publishing house a great robbery has been practiced in the meager wages paid to some of the workers if they give their time and thought and labor to the service of the master they should have wages enough to supply their families with food and clothing the light which the lord has given me on this subject is that the means in the treasury for the support of the ministers in the different fields is not to be used for any other purpose if an honest tithe were paid and the money coming into the treasury were carefully guarded the ministers would receive a just wage    the minister who labors should be sustained but notwithstanding this those who are officiating in this work see that there is not money in the treasury to pay the minister they are withdrawing the tithe for other expensesto keep up the meetinghouse necessities or some charity god is not glorified in any such work    gifts and offerings should be brought in by the people as they are privileged in having houses of worship    let housetohouse labor be done in setting before the families in battle creek and oakland their duty in acting a part in meeting these expenses which may be called common or secular and let not the treasury be robbed  special testimonies to ministers and workers pp 1619 while making clear that well established churches such as those in oakland and battle creek should not use tithe funds for church expense ellen white did at the same time 1897 recognize that there were circumstances where tithe funds might be used for church buildingsthere are exceptional cases where poverty is so deep that in order to secure the humblest place of worship it may be necessary to appropriate the tithes but that place is not battle creek or oakland let those who assemble to worship god consider the selfdenial and selfsacrifice of jesus christ let those brethren who profess to be children of god study how they can deny themselves how they can part with some of their idols and carefully economize in every line in each house there should be a box for the church fund to be used for the needs of the church     let not those to whom are entrusted responsibilities allow the treasury that god has appointed to sustain the ministers in the field to be robbed to supply the expenses incurred in keeping in order and making comfortable the home of god thousands upon thousands of dollars have been taken from the tithes and used for these purposes this is not as it should be the page 12gifts and offerings that have cost some selfdenial are to be brought in a separate fund for the purpose of defraying the expenses which every church member should share according to his ability should be instituted in every place where there is a church ms 24 1897 this message led to an exchange of correspondence c h jones of oakland wrote immediately to elder white that the oakland church was not using tithe funds for church expense and mrs white replied on may 27 1897 writing at length in appreciation and again stressing the importance of reserving tithe funds for the specific purpose for which it is intended in this she declared if there is a surplus of means in the treasury there are many places where it may be used strictly in the appointed lines letter 81 1897 the next year ellen white restated the matter in a manner concerning which there can be no questiongods ministers are his shepherds appointed by him to feed his flock the tithe is his provision for their maintenance and he designs that it shall be held sacred to this purpose ms 139 1898 again six years later she stressed this pointthe tithe is to be used for one purposeto sustain the ministers whom the lord has appointed to do his work it is to be used to support those who speak the words of life to the people and carry the burden of the flock of god    the impression is becoming quite common that the sacred disposition of the tithe no longer exists many have lost their sense of the lords requirements ms 82 1904 the diversion of tithe funds top of this sectionin many of her later statements relative to the use of the tithe ellen white speaks of how funds have been diverted to areas other than that to which the tithe was dedicated that is for the support of the ministry as we have gone through the early records we find that on may 4 1898 the general conference committee at a meeting attended by elders irwin jones evans and moon was persuaded by dr j h kellogg to allow the use of the tithe paid by the sanitarium helpers to be devoted under the direction of the medical missionary association to supporting trained workers and nurses to carry the light of health reform principles into the various conferences for the education of this denomination it is not too clear whether this was to be the tithe funds going directly from the sanitarium to the field or whether the tithe was to be paid to the general conference and the general conference was then to turn around and provide an equal amount for this type of work on march 27 1900 a report to the general conference committee from the medical missionary and benevolent association provided an account of the receipts and disbursements of the tithes of the sanitarium family from may 25 1898 to december 31 1899 attached to this was a copy of the may 4 1898 authorizing action on april 4 1900 the question was raised as to the procedure which had been approved on may 4 1898 and a committee was appointed to bring a recommendation as to the course which should be pursued the committee reported on april 6 1900 taking the position that they did not feel free to make a definite recommendation at this time and interestingly enough by common consent the committee deemed it prudent to let the matter rest page 13for the present apparently they were not prepared to tangle with dr kellogg on this there is a record indicating that when brother semmens was sent to australia as a medical missionary worker part of his support came from the tithe provided by the battle creek sanitarium family however the sentiment generally reflected in various and sundry documents indicates that it was the understanding of the church that the tithe was reserved especially for the ministry early g c committee action on tithe funds for church buildings top of this sectionat its meeting of december 28 1889 attended by o a olsen w c white r m kilgore e w farnsworth and a t jones the general conference committee took the following actiona letter was read from a sister gillett of graysville tennessee asking that they might be permitted to retain their tithes for one year to assist in building a meetinghouse on motion it was voted that it is the sense of this committee that we do not endorse the withholding of tithes for such purposes under any circumstances second that we promise the brethren at graysville a donation to assist in building a meetinghouse gc committee minutes december 28 1889 the tithe for those who labor in word and doctrine top of this sectionin the late 1890s ellen white on several occasions spoke of the remuneration of women in evangelistic work either in the sacred desk or in carrying the message from door to doora great work is to be done in our world and every talent is to be used in accordance with righteous principles if a woman is appointed by the lord to do a certain work her work is to be estimated according to its value every laborer is to receive his or her just due    those who work earnestly and unselfishly be they men or women bring sheaves to the master and the souls converted by their labor will bring their tithes to the treasury ev 491 492 the next year she wrotethe tithe should go to those who labor in word and doctrine be they men or women ev 492 as testimonies for the church vol 6 came from the press in late 1900 it carried several strong appeals for the outreach of the work and the need of this being supported by the tithe in the chapter on school management and finance she declaredour conferences look to the schools for educated and welltrained laborers and they should give the schools a most hearty and intelligent support light has been plainly given that those who minister in our schools teaching the word of god explaining the scriptures educating the students in the things of god should be supported by the tithe money this instruction was given long ago and more recently it has been repeated again and again 6t 215 a full chapter was devoted to tithe and offerings entitled giving to god his own stressing strongly our responsibility to support from the tithe those who carry the message of salvation to the worldhe god places his treasures in the hands of men but requires that onetenth shall be faithfully laid aside for his work he requires this portion to be placed in his treasury it is to be rendered to him as his own it is sacred and is to be used for sacred purposes for the support of those who carry the message of salvation to all parts of the world page 14he reserves this portion that means may ever be flowing into his treasure house and that the light of truth may be carried to those who are nigh and those who are afar off by faithfully obeying this requirement we acknowledge that all belongs to god    god lays his hand upon all mans possessions saying i am the owner of the universe and these goods are mine the tithe you have withheld i reserve for the support of my servants in their work of opening the scriptures to those who are in the regions of darkness who do not understand my law in using my reserve fund to gratify your own desires you have robbed souls of the light which i made provision for them to receive you have had opportunity to show loyalty to me but you have not done this you have robbed me you have stolen my reserve fund ye are cursed with a curse mal 39 6t 386 387 and in her call for help for mission fields she specified that the tithe should be used in missionary workevery convert to the truth should be instructed in regard to the lords requirement for tithes and offerings as churches are raised up this work must be taken hold of decidedly and carried forward in the spirit of christ all that men enjoy they receive from the lords great firm and he is pleased to have his heritage enjoy his goods but all who stand under the bloodstained banner of prince immanuel are to acknowledge their dependence upon god and their accountability to him by returning to the treasury a certain portion as his own this is to be invested in missionary work in fulfillment of the commission given to his disciples by the son of god 6t 447 the decade preceding the issuance of testimonies  vol 6 had marked an important expansion in our school work colleges had been opened in lincoln nebraska walla walla washington and cooranbong australia it is in volume 6 that we find the first clearcut declaration concerning paying bible teachers from the tithethe best ministerial talent should be employed in teaching the bible in our schools those selected for this work need to be thorough bible students and to have a deep christian experience and their salary should be paid from the tithe  6t 134 135 the emphasis was to continue on a faithful stewardship of every church memberif all would pay a faithful tithe and devote to the lord the first fruits of their increase there would be a full supply of funds for his work but the law of god is not respected or obeyed and this has brought a pressure of want  6t 385 the element of the care to be taken in the use of the tithe became more prominent and was to be intensified in the next decadea decade of unprecedented expansion in the work of the church by this time sabbath school offerings were being taken up on a regular basis the first was in 1878the year of the revision of the tithe planand was used for local sabbath school expense in 1885 sabbath schools made their first gifts to missions in 1889 and 1890 the sabbath schools provided funds for building the pitcairn by 1904 most sabbath school offerings went for foreign missions the tithe and school support top of this sectionit was in this setting at the turn of the century that we moved into our church school work in a serious way there were various suggestions made as page 15to how this line of work should be supported on july 29 1901 ellen white wrotethe lord desires the churches in every place to take hold more diligently of the church school work giving liberally to sustain the teachers the question has been asked could not the second tithe be used for the support of the church school work it could be used for no better purpose ms 67 1901 on october 29 1901 the general conference committee took an action on the second tithe in which it was arranged for certain second tithe funds to be returned to the pacific union conference but without specifying their use when san fernando academy was opened about the year 1904 it was proposed that the school be supported from the second tithe and at about that time two pamphlets were published by the southern california conference one was the second tithe its scripture foundation and legitimate use  written by r s owen and the other was the second tithe by clarence santee and r s owen but ellen white on april 27 1904 wrotei do not see the wisdom of the school depending on the second tithe to meet so much of its expenses i fear that if the brethren rely so much upon this difficulties will arise you should labor patiently to develop those industries by which students may partly work their way through school let each family try to pay the expenses of the students that it sends to school letter 167 1904 addressed to brethren santee and owen on april 7 1905 ellen white wrote to e s ballenger who was connected with our school workin regard to the school work i have been instructed that the plan of charging students nothing for tuition depending on the second tithe to support the school will always leave the school in the condition of financial embarrassment when i first heard of this movement i thought i would let it be worked out but i tell you now that the light given me is that other plans will have to be made than the plan of supporting schools from the second tithe students should be charged a reasonable price for their tuition there will be an abundance of places to use the second tithe in doing earnest missionary work in new places letter 103 1905 and then on october 4 1905 ellen white wrote to elder clarence santeewe are now wrestling with the debt on the fernando college if our people will take hold earnestly of the sale of christs object lessons a great deal may be accomplished the plans for supporting this school in the past were not wisely laid i hope that no one will endeavor to go over the same ground again and make similar mistakes letter 279 1905 in the context of these times ellen white in 1904 penned a statement on the use of the tithe ms 82 1904 portions of which were to form a part of the counsels which eventually were published in testimonies vol 9 under the title of faithful stewardship the full 1904 statement appears as appendix a it is significant considerable attention has been focused on the paragraph on pages 248 249 of testimonies vol 9 concerning the use of tithe for school purposes and support of canvassers and colporteurs history of the statement in questiona as noted it appears first in manuscript 82 1904 as followsone reasons that the tithe may be applied to school purposes still others page 16reason that canvassers and colporteurs should be supported from the tithe but a great mistake is made when the tithe is drawn from the object for which it is to be usedthe support of the ministers there should be today in the field one hundred well qualified laborers where now there is but one  see full manuscript as appendix a b in preparing for a presentation to be made at san jose california in january 1907 at a symposium on the support of gods kingdom on earth ellen white incorporated the paragraph in the heart of the manuscript she would readc the ellen g white symposium article was embodied in 1909 in testimonies vol 9 pp 245251 in the chapter faithful stewardship thus we have the paragraph in question appearing three times 1904 1907 1909 no special issues or crises apparent as responsible for the counsel top of this sectionthe question has been raised whether in 1904 or 1907 there were special issues or crises either in our educational work or the colporteur ministry very careful examination of the minutes of the general conference of the correspondence between ellen whites office and leading church workers and the e g white files themselves fails to reveal that there was any special crisis situation which led ellen white to write as she did the 1884 butler pamphlet in which he expresses his conviction that tithe money should help support the newly established colporteur ministry was however in circulation in 1904 the year of writing of the statement in question as to the payment of colporteurs the records from 1901 to 1904 which we have examined make no reference to the suggestion that colporteurs might be paid from the tithe these facts give support to the conjecture that ellen whites statement concerning school interests and colporteurs appears only in general terms in the context of a statement dealing with the tithe and its use and was written to safeguard the use of the tithe it should be ever kept in mind that the burden of many of the e g white statements regarding the use of the tithe and the diversion of tithe funds is that there shall always be ample funds in the treasury to adequately pay the ministers and to support the strong evangelistic thrust throughout the world she wrotethere should be an abundant supply in the lords treasury and there would be if selfish hearts and hands had not made use of the tithe to support other lines of work gods reserved resources are to be used in no such haphazard way the tithe is the lords and those who meddle with it will be punished with the loss of their heavenly treasure unless they repent let the work no longer be hedged up because the tithe has been diverted into various channels other than the one to which the lord has said it should be provision is to be made for these other lines of work they are to be sustained but not from the tithe god has not changed the tithe is still to be used for the support of the ministry the opening of new fields requires more ministerial efficiency than we now have and there must be means in the treasury  9t 249 250 top of this section table of

unusual situations d inappropriate use of the tithe e considerations and conclusions a introduction top of this sectionat the time of the organization of the seventhday adventist church we did not have a fullfledged tithing system nor did we have any instruction from ellen white relative to usage of the tithe mrs whites earliest comments on how tithe funds should be spent were of a very general nature late in 1879 she wroteinstitutions that are gods instruments to carry forward his work on the earth must be sustained churches must be erected schools established and publishing houses furnished with facilities for doing a great work in the publication of the truth to be sent to all parts of the world these institutions are ordained of god and should be sustained by tithes and liberal offerings as the work enlarges means will be needed to carry it forward in all its branches  4t 464 three years later she made a somewhat similar comment a tithe of all our increase is the lords he has reserved it to himself to be employed for religious purposes cs 67 however by the 1890s ellen white had become much more explicit in her counsel as the church grew and new problems and challenges had to be faced the lord gave her increased light and understanding of his will in this matter on march 16 1897 she wrote to a g daniellsi send you this morning a letter written for america and sent there yesterday morning which will show you how i regard the tithe money being used for other purposes see special testimonies series a no 10 pp 1625 this is the lords special revenue fund for a special purpose i have never so fully understood this matter as i now understand it having had questions directed here to me to answer i have had special instruction from the lord that the tithe is for a special purpose consecrated to god to sustain those who minister in the sacred work as the lords chosen to do his work not only in sermonizing but in ministering they should understand all that this comprehends  letter 40 1897 1mr 187 ellen white herself helps us to understand all that this comprehends for she specifically approved certain usages of the tithe while she just as specifically disapproved of others b appropriate use of the tithe top of this sectionaccording to ellen white tithe funds may properly be used for the support of the following classes of workers or projects1 gospel ministerslet each regularly examine his income which is all a blessing from god and set apart the tithe as a separate fundpage 18to be sacredly the lords this fund should not in any case be devoted to any other use it is to be devoted solely to support the ministry of the gospel rh may 9 1893 cs 81 the tithe is to be used for one purposeto sustain the ministers whom the lord has appointed to do his work it is to be used to support those who speak the words of life to the people and carry the burden of the flock of god    when a man enters the ministry he is to be paid from the tithe enough to sustain his family he is not to feel that he is a beggar  ms 82 19042 bible instructors top of this sectionthe tithe should go to those who labor in word and doctrine be they men or women  ev 492 there are ministers wivessisters starr haskell wilson and robinsonwho have been devoted earnest wholesouled workers giving bible readings and praying with families helping along by personal efforts just as successfully as their husbands these women give their whole time and are told that they receive nothing for their labors because their husbands receive wages i tell them to go forward and all such decisions will be revised the word says the laborer is worthy of his hire when any such decision as this is made i will in the name of the lord protest i will feel it my duty to create a fund from my tithe money to pay these women who are accomplishing just as essential work as the ministers are doing  letter 137 1898 mr 9593 bible teachers top of this sectionsome women are now teaching young women to work successfully as visitors and bible readers    should not such labor be looked upon as being as rich in results as the work of the ordained ministers should it not command the hire of the laborers would not such workers be defrauded if they were not paid in many respects a woman can impart knowledge to her sisters that a man cannot the cause would suffer great loss without this kind of labor again and again the lord has shown me that women teachers are just as greatly needed to do the work to which he has appointed them as are men  ms 43a 1898 mr 330 the best ministerial talent should be employed to lead and direct in the teaching of the bible in our schools those chosen for this work need to be thorough bible students they should be men who have a deep christian experience and their salary should be paid from the tithe  ct 431 1913 light has been plainly given that those who minister in our schools teaching the word of god explaining the scriptures educating the students in the things of god should be supported by the tithe money this instruction was given long ago and more recently it has been repeated again and again  6t 215 1900 cs 103 on december 4 1904 w c white wrote william covert president of the wisconsin conferencein working out this problem in schools that mother was closely connected with the tithe was only used for the minister connected with the school who had the chief burden of the bible instruction whose special work was the fiting of young people for evangelical work4 needy mission fields both in america and overseas top of this sectionin some of the larger conferences the tithe may be more than sufficient to sustain the laborers now in the field but page 19this does not sanction its use for any other purpose if the conferences were doing the work that god desires them to do there would be many more laborers in the field and the demand for funds would be greatly increased the conferences should feel a burden for the regions beyond their own borders there are missions to be sustained in fields where there are no churches and no tithes and also where the believers are new and the tithe limited if you have means that is not needed after settling with your ministers in a liberal manner send the lords money to these destitute places  ms 139 1898 1mr 182 184 more and more we must come to realize that the means that come into the conference in the tithes and gifts of our people should be used for the support of the work not only in the american cities but also in foreign fields let the means so zealously collected be unselfishly distributed those who realize the needs of mission fields will not be tempted to use the tithe for that which is not necessary  ms 11 1908 1mr 1925 publishing department directors top of this sectionw c white wrote w s lowry on may 10 1912in many conferences in past years the question has arisen as to whether it was lawful and expedient to pay the state canvassing agent from the tithe this matter has been discussed in union and in general conference councils and our brethren feel clear in supporting the state agent from the tithe because the books are very effective preachers whenever this question has been brought to mother she has given her approval of the plan generally adopted by our people6 medical missionaries ministerphysicians top of this sectionsome who do not see the advantage of educating the youth to be physicians both of the mind and of the body say that the tithe should not be used to support medical missionaries who devote their time to treating the sick in response to such statements as these i am instructed to say that the mind must not become so narrowed down that it cannot take in the truth of the situation a minister of the gospel who is also a medical missionary who can cure physical ailments is a much more efficient worker than one who cannot do this his work as a minister of the gospel is much more complete  mm 2457 retirement benefits for ministers and their families top of this sectionmany workers have gone into the grave heartbroken because they had grown old and could see that they were looked upon as a burden but had they been retained in the work and given an easy place with a whole or part of their wages they might have accomplished much good during their term of labor these men have done double labor they felt so heavy a burden for souls that they had no desire to be relieved of overwork the heavy burdens borne shortened their lives the widows of these ministers are never to be forgotten but should if necessary be paid from the tithe  ms 82 1904 1mr 189 on february 24 1911 e r palmer wrote ellen white describing the details of the newly adopted sustentation plan he stated each of our conferences contributes five percent of its tithes to the sustentation fund ellen white respondedi was pleased to receive a letter from you as one who has been appointed to act a part in the distribution of the sustentation fund    it is right that sure plans be laid for the support of our aged workers or the younger workers who are page 20suffering because of overwork letter 10 1911 mr 1938 a partial salary for some literature evangelists top of this sectionaccording to w c white some colporteurs were provided a partial salary in australia while sister white was there on june 11 1902 he wrote the publishing director of the lake union conferencei see no light whatever in any wholesale move for placing canvassers on the payroll and taking their commissions i have studied the proposition many times and i see nothing in it but financial ruin to the conference and demoralization to the canvassers there are many places however where our canvassers ought to be but which are too difficult to work and i believe it would be greatly to the advantage of our work if faithful men and women were selected to go into our cities and other fields that are especially difficult with the promise of two to three dollars per week to assist them in their living expenses during those times in their work when their commissions do not give them ample support i have seen this plan followed with excellent results and i believe in it most heartily in the australian colonies we could not afford to support bible workers on the oldfashioned plan but we secured as many colporteurs as we could get to sell the bible echo the health journal and our smaller books in the large cities and we paid these workers from two to two and a half dollars a week each from the conference tithe to assist them in their expenses i believe that it will be necessary to follow a plan similar to this in many difficult fieldsw c white to j b blosser june 11 1902 while we do not have a statement from ellen white endorsing this use of tithe funds it seems reasonable to conclude that she was in agreement with the plan for it was in effect in australia while she was there the fact that w c white defended the plan would also seem to indicate that ellen white approved of it c tithe usages in unusual situations top of this section1 houses of worship in exceptional casesthere are exceptional cases where poverty is so deep that in order to secure the humblest place of worship it may be necessary to appropriate the tithes but that place is not battle creek or oakland ms 24 1897 1mr 191 all here petoskey michigan are poor scarcely able to take care of themselves now the request i have to make is for the conference to buy this little meetinghouse we want you all to consent to this and the conference may own it until the church here increases in numbers and can buy it letter 96 1890 to o a olsen general conference president2 the clerk and treasurer of large churches top of this sectionc f mc vagh president of the southern union conference wrote w c white on october 24 1912brethren nicola hart and others of the older brethren tell me that they distinctly remember that years ago sister white said that the tithe collector and clerk of the battle creek church should be paid out of the tithe and up to the time of the haughey administration i guess it is a fact that the battle creek church paid its clerk and treasurer out of the tithe and then turned the balance over to the conference in responding w c white said his recollections were the same page 21my memory of the matter is in full harmony with the statements of brother nicola hart and others in the olden days when the battle creek church was growing it was found that unless the work of collecting the tithe was followed up regularly that the amount received was very much less than if the matter were followed up in a businesslike way by a collector who made the work his regular duty we also found that this work demanded more time than it was right for us to ask any one two or three of the deacons to give to the matter and it was thought by the church council that it would be good policy and for the best interests of the tithe payers and for the best interests of the conference to have a good collector chosen and employed and paid a reasonable amount for his time this plan with the reasons therefor was placed before father  and mother and received their hearty approval i cannot name the time or the place nor can i repeat the words but i am very positive that mother gave her hearty approval to this plan and it seems to me that the wisdom of the plan can be clearly discerned from the business standpoint and that it should be maintained even though we may not find a written testimony bearing upon the subject in years past there was no effort made to conceal from other churches the fact that battle creek managed its affairs in this way our brethren largely recognized that different methods must be followed in churches of different circumstances i am glad to tell you that the st helena sanitarium church employs a faithful tithe collector and pays for actual service done from the tithe should this plan be discontinued i think the conference would lose from five to ten times as much as it paid to the collector but we do not find that our smaller churches need to follow this plan or that they are brought into perplexity because this plan is followed in our very large churchesw c white to c f mc vagh october 31 1912 james white died in 1881 so this was a very early practice in battle creek the fact that the st helena sanitarium church was paying its tithe collector in 1912 would seem to indicate ellen whites continued approval of the plan3 medical missionary work to a very limited degree top of this sectionon may 4 1898 the general conference committee authorized a tithefortithe exchange with dr kellogg concerning this special fund dr john harvey kellogg wrote ellen white on march 17 1901tithe which is paid by our sanitarium workers is all paid into the conference treasury just the same as other tithes every cent of it but at our request and with your approval an equal sum is appropriated to be used in carrying forward the missionary work connected with the sanitarium this is the way the matter has always been conducted and i have never asked for anything else ellen white apparently approved of dr kelloggs use of tithe funds for medical missionary purposes for three years earlier she had written to our leading brethrenwhy i ask you have not special efforts been made to employ medical missionary workers in our churches dr kellogg will make some moves that i would feel sorry to have him feel compelled to make he says if no means is allowed to carry the message by medical missionary laborers into the churches he shall separate the tithe that is paid into the conference to sustain the medical missionary work you should come to an understanding and work harmoniously for him to separate the tithe from the page 22treasury would be a necessity i greatly dread if this money in tithe is paid by the workers into the treasury why i ask should not that amount be apportioned to the carrying forward of the medical missionary work letter 51a 1898 if no help is given by the presidents of our conferences and ministers to those engaged in our work dr kellogg will no longer pay in the tithe from the workers at the sanitarium they will appropriate this to carrying forward the work that is in harmony with the light of gods word    when the lord moves upon the churches bidding them do a certain work and they refuse to do that work and someone consents to reach to the very depths of human woe and misery gods blessing will rest upon him letter 51 1898 ellen white cautioned that this type of work while important should not absorb all the energies of the church she queriedif we should all engage in the work that dr kellogg has been doing for the lowest class of people what would become of the work that is to be done in the places where the third angels message the truth upon the sabbath and the second coming of our lord has never been proclaimed letter 18 1900 d inappropriate use of the tithe top of this sectionellen white also identified certain purposes for which the tithe was not to be employed these included the following1 care of the poor the sick and the agedthrough circumstances some will become poor it may be that they were not careful that they did not know how to manage others through sickness or misfortune are poor whatever is the reason they are in need and to help them is an important line of home missionary work these unfortunate needy ones should not be sent away from home to be cared for let each church feel its responsibility to have a special interest in the feeble and the aged one or two among them can certainly be taken care of the tithe should not be appropriated for this work ms 43 1900 mr 177 the tithe is set apart for a special use it is not to be regarded as a poor fund cs 1032 the education of needy students top of this sectionnow in regard to educating students in our schools it is a good idea it will have to be done but god forbid that in the place of practicing selfdenial and selfsacrifice our individual selves to do this work we should subtract from the lords portion specifically reserved to sustain the ministers in active labor in the field    all these things are to be done as you propose to help students to obtain an education but i ask you shall we not all act in this matter unselfishly and create a fund and keep it to draw upon on such occasions when you see a young man or a young woman who are promising subjects advance or loan the sum needed with the idea that it is a loan not a gift it would be better to have it thus then when it is returned it can be used to educate others but this money is not to be taken from the tithe but from a separate fund secured for that purpose letter 40 1897 1mr 193 1943 school purposes and colporteur support top of this sectionone reasons that the tithe may be applied to school purposes still others reason that

provision is to be made for these other lines of work they are to be sustained but not from the tithe 9t 248250 19094 church expense top of this sectioni was shown that it is wrong to use the tithe for defraying the incidental expenses of the church    you are robbing god every time that you put your hands into the treasury for funds to meet the running expenses of the church   cs 103 his people today are to remember that the house of worship is the lords property and that it is to be scrupulously cared for but the funds for this work are not to come from the tithe 9t 248 1909  after reading this message from ellen white the battle creek church voted on january 16 1897 that the church discontinue the practice of paying the current expenses of the church and tabernacle out of the tithe

including land and furnishings was 36000 a decade later indebtedness on the building had been reduced to 12400 but for various reasons the members were having great difficulty in making the mortgage payments on february 1 1897 c h jones wrote ellen whitewe are in an emergency there is great danger unless this debt is lifted that the church will be allowed to go by default and the mortgage foreclosed    would it be wrong sister white under the circumstances for the oakland church to retain a portion of its tithe for a time in order to liquidate the indebtednesssimply taking it as a loan to be paid back to the conference as soon as possible if it is wrong we do not want to do it if it is right it will be a great relief to the church responding in a general way ellen white declaredthere are exceptional cases where poverty is so deep that in order to secure the humblest place of worship it may be necessary to appropriate the tithes but that place is not battle creek or oakland ms 24 1897 1mr 191 then in a letter to jones under date of may 27 she more directly answered his question when she statedevery soul who is honored in being a steward of god is to carefully guard the tithe money this is sacred means the lord will not sanction your borrowing this money for any other work it will create evils you cannot now discern it is not to be meddled with by the oakland church for there are missions to be sustained in other fields where there are no churches and no tithes letter 81 1897 1mr 185 in 18951896 the boulder sanitarium was erected at a cost of about 80000 of this amount 60000 was supplied from general conference funds which were basically tithe funds ellen white objected to this means of financing the construction costs of the institution on june 19 1899 she wrotethe question has been asked me by letter have you any light for us in regard to the boulder sanitarium  the light which the lord has been pleased to give me is that it was not right to build this sanitarium upon funds supplied by the general conference letter 93 1899 page 24e considerations and conclusions top of this sectionellen white states that the tithe should be used for one purposeto sustain the ministers and that it is to be devoted solely to support the ministry of the gospel these expressions would seem to indicate that tithe funds should be reserved exclusively to pay the salaries of pastors and evangelists however it is evident that ellen white did not interpret her own writings in such a limited way as legitimate recipients of tithe funds she included publishing department directors ministerphysicians dr kelloggs medical missionaries a church treasurer and clerk and apparently literature evangelists with especially difficult territorial assignments ellen whites rather broad understanding of the question of tithe usage is further underscored by her willingness to make exceptions to the rules under certain circumstances as noted she agreed that in cases of dire poverty tithe funds could be used to secure houses of worship true this was an exceptionalnot a regularuse of the tithe but it did in fact receive ellen whites endorsement on the other hand ellen white named several causes for which tithe money was not to be appropriated in specifying that the tithe should not be used for church expense care for the destitute colporteur salaries or school purposes she was not labeling these causes as undeserving rather if the tithe should be used for these and other similar good programs there would not be enough money left to support the gospel ministry the basic rationale for giving top priority to the gospel ministry in the use of tithe funds must be that pastors evangelists and conference administrators have no other adequate source of income available for their support this is also true of other conference office personnel such as secretaries accountants custodians etc colporteurs teachers medical institution workers and publishing house employees all generate an income from their labors this is not true of ministers or conference office personnel hence if the tithe is diverted to other enterprises the gospel ministry will suffer and in consequence the church as a whole will suffer as well question may be raised as to why ellen white approved of paying the battle creek church tithe collector treasurer from the tithe when he was not a minister and was not engaged in ministerial work the answer probably lies in the fact that his work led to a much larger tithe income for the conference even after his salary was paid than would have been the case had he not been so employed question may also be raised as to why ellen white urged local congregations to meet their operating expenses utilities maintenance office supplies etc from free will offerings while she did not give similar counsel concerning conference office expenses in other words if it is proper to pay the electric bill in the conference office from tithe funds why not pay the local churchs electric bill from the tithe also the answer to this question may be that conference office expenses are incurred in order to provide a support center for the conference leaders these expenses become part of the ministerial function on the other hand the same expenses in a local church provide a support center for the laity and are not page 25exclusively connected with the work of the pastor there is still one other matter that deserves attention a practice occasionally encountered over the years is that of a few church members assigning their tithe to projects of their own choice ellen white opposed this procedure she statedlet none feel at liberty to retain their tithe to use according to their own judgment they are not to use it for themselves in an emergency nor to apply it as they see fit even in what they may regard as the lords work    if our churches will take their stand upon the lords word and be faithful paying their tithe into his treasury more laborers will be encouraged to take up ministerial work more men would give themselves to the ministry were they not told of the depleted treasury 9t 247 249 the treasury in ellen whites view was the conference she was pleased that dr kellogg was paying all the sanitarium workers tithe into the conference see p 23 and she revealed great distress at the thought that this plan might be discontinued for him to separate the tithe from the treasury she wrote would be a necessity i greatly dread letter 51a 1898 in ellen whites view then the various conferences should bear the responsibility of authorizing the expenditure of tithe funds and this should be done through representative groups of church leaders who form our local union and general conference committees ellen white objected strongly to the kingly power exerted by a few men who controlled all general conference funds through the 1890s at the general conference session in 1901 she admonished the delegatesit is not in his gods order that two or three men shall plan for the whole conference and decide how the tithe shall be used as though the tithe were a fund of their own 1901 gcb 83 if the various conferences are to decide how tithe funds should be used some may wonder why ellen white at times appropriated her tithe to causes of her own choice the answer to this question is given by arthur l white in the early elmshaven years 389397 a fair consideration of the complete spectrum of ellen whites comments on this subject leads to the following summary of principles to be applied in the appropriation of tithe funds1 the tithe is the lords and should be returned to the storehouse the conference treasury through the members home church2 gospel ministers and bible instructors should have first call on the tithe and they should be remunerated adequately pp 17 18 sections 1 23 the conference should share the tithe with the world church p 18 section 44 church members should give offerings for the operating expenses of the local church pp 20 21 22 sections 1 2 45 some aspects of the gospel even though they are important should not be supported from tithe as other sources of funding are available for them p 22 section 36 exceptions to these principles may be made only in cases of dire poverty or under extraordinarily unusual circumstances see c tithe usages in unusual sotuations  june 1 1986 revised february 1990 top of this section table of contentsellen g white and the titheby arthur l white table of contentsmrs white and the payment of the tithe the special work of ellen g white the e g white letter concerning the tithe the tithe that was entrusted to mrs white another case of gross distortion this paper constitutes a brief historical review of the unique position of mrs white in regard to certain special situations relating to the tithe before sabbathkeeping adventists had organized churches and conferences and before we had chosen the name seventhday adventists the believers came to see the binding claims of the tithing system presented so clearly in the scriptures under the general term systematic benevolence they adopted early in 1859 a tithe plan which was figured on the basis of property it was estimated that ones property should yield an income of ten percent a yearthis was the increase a tithe would be one tenth of this or one percent a year of total property valuation as testimony no 5 came from the press in june 1859 it bore the assurance that the plan of systematic benevolence is pleasing to god ellen white told of how in vision she was pointed back to the days of the apostles and saw that god laid the plan by the descent of his holy spirit and that by the gift of prophecy he counseled his people in regard to a system of benevolence all were to share in this work of imparting of their carnal things to those who ministered unto them in spiritual things 1t 190 there was a good response to the plan and for nearly twenty years there was little or no change in the plan of systematic benevolence then in 1878 workers and church members came to see that there was a defect in figuring the tithe on the basis of property holdings and that by the bible plan one dollar of every ten earned is secured to the lords cause and that to pay a proper tithe called for a tithe of all our income see systematic benevolence or the bible plan of supporting the ministry  1878 from the inception of tithing among us certain principles stood out in bold relief1 the tithe is to be used for the support of the ministry this thought is embodied in the initial spirit of prophecy statement just quoted above in the reference to those who ministered in spiritual things it is a thread running through all the counsel touching on the tithe given over a period of fifty years as in such typical statementsthe tithe is sacred reserved by god for himself it is to be brought into his treasury to be used to sustain the gospel laborers in their work gw 226 it the tithe is to be devoted solely to support the ministry of the gospel cs 81 let the work no longer be hedged up because the tithe has been diverted into various channels other than the one page 27to which the lord has said it should go provision is to be made for these other lines of work they are to be sustained but not from the tithe god has not changed the tithe is still to be used for the support of the ministry 9t 2502 the tithe is to be brought into the storehouse and from there is to be dispersed it is part of the ministers work to teach those who accept the truth through his efforts to bring the tithe to the storehouse as an acknowledgement of their dependence upon god gw 370 he god claims the tithe as his own and it should ever be regarded as a sacred reserve to be placed in his treasury and held sacred for his service as he has appointed 9t 247 2483 unlike his responsibility in the matter of freewill offerings the tithepayer has no discretion as to the place where his tithe should be paid that portion that god has reserved for himself is not to be diverted to any other purpose than that which he has specified let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe to use according to their own judgment they are not to use it for themselves in an emergency nor to apply it as they see fit even in what they may regard as the lords work 9t 247 a very plain definite message has been given to me for our people i am bidden to tell them that they are making a mistake in applying the tithe to various objects which though good in themselves are not the object to which the lord has said that the tithe should be applied those who make this use of the tithe are departing from the lords arrangement god will judge for these things 9t 248 some have been dissatisfied and have said i will not longer pay my tithe for i have no confidence in the way things are managed at the heart of the work but will you rob god because you think the management of the work is not right make your complaint plainly and openly in the right spirit to the proper ones send in your petitions for things to be adjusted and set in order but do not withdraw from the work of god and prove unfaithful because others are not doing right 9t 2494 god has had one plan for all dispensations a tithe of all our increase is the lords he has reserved it to himself to be employed for religious purposes it is holy nothing less than this has he accepted in any dispensation a neglect or postponement of this duty will provoke the divine displeasure if all professed christians would faithfully bring their tithes to god his treasury would be full  rh may 16 1882  we propose that the friends give a tithe or tenth of their income estimating their income at ten percent of what they possess james white in good samaritan january 1861 mrs white and the payment of the tithe top of this sectionnothing is plainer in the e g white writings than the clear instruction concerning the faithful payment of the tithe and the fact that it is reserved for the support of the ministry there are a few individuals who use the e g white writings and their knowledge of certain special situations in a strange manner they attempt to circumvent the clear plain counsels which have guided the church in the matter of handling the tithe and aim to lead others to assume the responsibility of handling their tithe on their own responsibility we feel dutybound to point out a gross distortion of e g white teaching as we do this it will become clear that there is no justification for certain conclusions page 28drawn and expounded by these detractors first we should establish mrs whites personal relationship to the obligation of the tithe and the manner in which she paid her tithe let her speak as she did in 1890 in a statement published in an early pamphlet i pay my tithes gladly and freely saying as did david of thine own have we given thee lest some argue that this statement does not indicate that mrs white paid her tithes in the regular way into the conference treasury we give here the fuller settingyou who have been withholding your means from the cause of god read the book of malachi and see what is spoken there in regard to tithes and offerings cannot you see that it is not best under any circumstances to withhold your tithes and offerings because you are not in harmony with everything your brethren do the tithes and offerings are not the property of any man but are to be used in doing a certain work for god unworthy ministers may receive some of the means thus raised but dare anyone because of this withhold from the treasury and brave the curse of god i dare not i pay my tithes gladly and freely saying as did david of thine own have we given thee a selfish withholding from god will tend to poverty in our own souls act your part my brethren and sisters god loves you and he stands at the helm if the conference business is not managed according to the order of the lord that is the sin of the erring ones the lord will not hold you responsible for it if you do what you can to correct the evil but do not commit sin yourselves by withholding from god his own property cursed be he that doeth the work of the lord negligently or deceitfully when persons declare that they will not pay their tithes because the means are not used as they think they ought to be will theelder of the church or the minister sympathize with the sinners will he aid the enemy in his work or will he as a wise man endued with knowledge go to work to correct the vile and thus remove the stumblingblock but brethren do not be unfaithful in your lot stand in your place do not by your neglect of duty increase our financial difficulties  special testimonies series a no 1 pp 27 28 aug 10 1890 the special work of ellen g white top of this sectionseventhday adventists accept that mrs white was called to a special workthat of serving as a prophet but her work was broader than this she saysmy commission embraces the work of a prophet but it does not end there it embraces much more than the minds of those who have been sowing seeds of unbelief can comprehend  1sm 36 in an article in the review and herald the same year she penned the words quoted above ellen white outlined in considerable detail the broad work to which she was called the account is found in selected messages book 1 pp 33 34 we quote one itemi was charged not to neglect or pass by those who were being wronged    if i see those in positions of trust neglecting aged ministers i am to present the matter to those whose duty it is to care for them ministers who have faithfully done their work are not to be forgotten or neglected when they have become feeble in health  our conferences page 29are not to disregard the needs of those who have borne the burdens of the work this placed a heavy burden on ellen white as a denominational worker she knew from experience what it meant to face illness in the family with no provision for financial assistance she knew what it meant when james white while serving as president of the general conference was stricken with paralysis and she had to pull up the carpets from the floor the rag rugs of her own making and sell them as well as the furniture to secure means for the care of her husband so the instruction that in a special manner she was to watch out for ministers who might be in need was significant to her and not only was she to be alert to the needs of faithful workers but her attention was often called through vision to the cases of ministers or their families who were being neglected in many cases she gave financial assistance from her own income or from funds in her control for at times her personal resources were inadequate her son elder w c white wrote of this experience making reference to her request that certain neglected workers be given assistance from her incomewhen we pleaded with her that her income was all consumed in the work of preparing her books for publication she said in effectthe lord has shown me that the experience which your father and i have passed through in poverty and deprivation in the early days of our work has given to me a keen appreciation and sympathy for others who are passing through similar experiences of want and suffering and where i see workers in this cause that have been true and loyal to the work who are left to suffer it is my duty to speak in their behalf if this does not move the brethren to help them then i must help them even if i am obliged to use a portion of my tithe in doing so in harmony with this mother has many many times made request of our conference officers to give consideration to the necessities of humble but faithful workers whose needs were by some means overlooked in many instances her requests have been responded to and the needed help given but in some cases the lack of funds and the absence of appreciation of the worthiness and the necessities have left the needy workers without help and have left her to face the burden then she has said to me or to the bookkeeper send help as soon as you can and if necessary take it from my tithe in many cases we found it possible to respond to her requests by gifts from her personal funds and in some cases a portion of her tithe has been used these experiences relate mostly to the years we were in europe and australia and to the years 1900 to 1906 in behalf of the work in the southern states during the greater part of the time since my connection with mothers business in 1881 a full tithe has been paid on her salary to church or conference treasurers instead of paying tithe on the increase from her books there has been set apart an amount greater than a tithe from which she has made appropriations from time to time in accordance with the instruction mentioned above in view of the extraordinary and exceptional responsibilities placed upon her as a messenger of god having special light and special responsibility in behalf of the needy and the oppressed she says she has been given special and exceptional authority regarding the use of her tithe this authority she has used in a limited page 30way as seemed to be for the best interests of the causew c white in a statement regarding the use of the tithe  the retirement plan which makes provision for aged or incapacitated workers was not in effect until 1911 not to disregard the needs of those who have borne the burdens of the work the e g white letter concerning the tithe top of this sectionon january 22 1905 mrs white wrote a letter to the president of a local conference in which she sounded certain cautions and referred to the experience just recounted it has been quite widely published by those who would make inroads on the sacredness of the handling of the tithe some set it forth as an exhibit to give seeming justification to their course of action before we present the letter we will give the historical background the work of the denomination began relatively late and grew slowly in the southern part of the united states this was particularly so among the blacks the south of a century ago was backward and in general on a low economic level even when the church did make a beginning it was scattered and small and it was with great difficulty that it was maintained financially long before the southern union conference was organized a work was begun among the blacks by several workers who went at their own expense into the south this was recognized by the church and when the southern missionary society was formed to foster this endeavor in the south it was fully recognized and is found listed in the seventhday adventist yearbook as one of the organizations of the denomination the greater part of the work of the southern missionary society was the starting and maintenance of mission schools but it was also carrying forward other lines of evangelism and was supporting several ordained ministers for a time the society received a small appropriation from the conference but this amount though greatly appreciated by the officers of the society was a very small gift compared with the magnitude of the work they felt distressed over the fact that a neglected people in a destitute field were being deprived of the gospel message because their need and their helplessness were not understood while visiting in the state of colorado in the latter part of 1904 an agent of the southern missionary society received from one church a gift of about 400 to assist in the work of the society these funds came in response to his appeal for help in evangelizing the south some of the money was tithe elder w c white who was familiar with the details of this circumstance writes of thiswhen the agent of the southern missionary society asked the members of this colorado church for a donation they manifested a willingness to give and some of them said that they were paying a large tithe and some were not wholly pleased with the way in which it was used compared with the population of the state the conference was strong and it had a good income therefore some said let us send some of our tithe to be used in the good work for the neglected colored people in the southern states then the officers of the church and the agent of the society did in an irregular way what has since become very popular as a wise and unselfish policy when done in an orderly and regular way they transferred a portion of the tithe of a welltodo conference to a very destitute and needy mission field the officers of the southern missionary society did not use this money to pay their own wages they did not use it in any way for their personal benefit page 31neither did they pay it to the support of men whom the conferences in the south thought to be unfitted or unworthy neither was it paid to men who were carrying on an unauthorized work of their own devising the money was placed in the treasury of the southern missionary society and was paid out in a regular and economical way to approved laborers who were engaged in regular denominational work but the action was irregular on the part of the agent who received the money and the church that paid it to him by the officers of the colorado conference this action was considered to be not only irregular but wrong and censurable they thought that they needed the money for home use and they felt that the action of the officers of the southern missionary society was worthy of public condemnation and censure and that the money should be returned the officers of the society were in trouble they had used the money quickly in paying the wages of preachers and their income was greatly below their needs moreover they felt that a public denouncement would tend to diminish the small income that they were then receiving their trouble became known to sister white and from mountain view she wrote a letter to the conference president dated january 22 1905 here is her letter note carefully its wordingmy brother i wish to say to you be careful how you move you are not moving wisely the least you have to speak about the tithe that has been appropriated to the most needy and the most discouraging field in the world the more sensible you will be it has been presented to me for years that my tithe was to be appropriated by myself to aid the white and colored ministers who were neglected and did not receive sufficient properly to support their families when my attention was called to aged ministers white or black it was my special duty to investigate into their necessities and supply their needs this was to be my special work and i have done this in a number of cases no man should give notoriety to the fact that in special cases the tithe is used in that way in regard to the colored work in the south that field has been and is still being robbed of the means that should come to the workers in that field if there have been cases where our sisters have appropriated their tithe to the support of the ministers working for the colored people in the south let every man if he is wise hold his peace i have myself appropriated my tithe to the most needy cases brought to my notice i have been instructed to do this and as the money is not withheld from the lords treasury it is not a matter that should be commented upon for it will necessitate my making known these matters which i do not desire to do because it is not best some cases have been kept before me for years and i have supplied their needs from the tithe as god has instructed me to do and if any person shall say to me sister white will you appropriate my tithe where you know it is most needed i shall say yes i will and i have done so i commend those sisters who have placed their tithe where it is most needed to help to do a work that is being left undone if this matter is given publicity it will create a knowledge which would better be left as it is i do not care to give publicity to this work which the lord has appointed me to do and others to do page 32i send this matter to you so that you shall not make a mistake circumstances alter cases i would not advise that anyone should make a practice of gathering up tithe money but for years there have now and then been persons who have lost confidence in the appropriation of the tithe who have placed their tithe in my hands and said that if i did not take it they would themselves appropriate it to the families of the most needy ministers they could find i have taken the money given a receipt for it and told them how it was appropriated i write this to you so that you shall keep cool and not become stirred up and give publicity to this matter lest many more shall follow their example  letter 267 1905 as mrs white speaks of the use of the tithe in this particular case and in other cases it is always in the setting of money which was to be used for the support of our ministers any tithe money she handled was used as tithe money should be used in the letter under discussion she says i would not advise that anyone should make a practice of gathering up tithe money she also says as the money is not withheld from the lords treasury it is not a matter that should be commented upon and regarding the field to which it was transferred she says that field has been and is still being robbed of the means that should come to the workers in that field sister white then at a time when there was inadequate provision for these ordained ministers was authorized to meet these necessities even to the use of her tithe but this does not in any degree open the way for church members or ministers to bestow their tithe wherever they see fit it is very clear that this extraordinary experience does not authorize any laborer to gather up tithe money and appropriate it to his own use or to the use of his associates neither does it give license for anyone to invite our people to give their tithe to them for some very needy missionary enterprise there is not one phrase or sentence in this letter which would neutralize or countermand the clear and full instruction concerning paying tithe or its use when all the facts are before us it can easily be seen that any such use of the letter is a misuse the tithe that was entrusted to mrs white top of this sectionin the letter to the conference president quoted above mrs white on the basis of the special instruction god had given to her stated that if there are any persons that shall say to me sister white will you appropriate my tithe where you know it is the most needed i should say i will do this and i have done it  i have taken the money given a receipt for it and reported how it was appropriated she did not make a practice of gathering up tithe funds she never requested that tithe be placed in her hands there was a veteran colporteur who at times sent a portion of his tithe to mrs white to be used properly in the lords work how she handled such tithe is reflected in a letter she wrote to our workers in the south in which she explained the source of some 500 which she was hastening on to them in response to an urgent need made known to her she related how a large part of this was money given by the general public as she made an appeal at a large gathering a part of it was tithe money placed in her hands by this colporteur of this portion she wrote page 33i have 75 from brother r tithe money and we thought that it would be best to send it along to the southern field to help colored ministers    i want it specially applied to the colored ministers to help them in their salaries letter 262 1902 but writing to this man at another time she revealed not only her course of action but her attitude toward such matters urging confidence in his brethren and the regular manner of handling the titheyou ask if i will accept tithe from you and use it in the cause of god where most needed in reply i will say that i shall not refuse to do this but at the same time i will tell you that there is a better way it is better to put confidence in the ministers of the conference where you live and in the officers of the church where you worship draw nigh to your brethren love them with a true heart fervently and encourage them to bear their responsibilities faithfully in the fear of god be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity letter 96 1911 great changes have come into our work since the days when mrs white made use of tithe funds entrusted to her the retirement fund has been established and through this blessed agency money is wisely distributed to workers who were formerly neglected furthermore plans have been adopted by which tithe is sent out of the conferences that are strong for the support of the work in conferences and missions that are needy much will be found in the testimonies for the church regarding tithe paying and systematic benevolence but nothing to sustain the idea that it is right for ministers or other workers either authorized or selfappointed to receive and use the tithe to support themselves in independent work surely no honesthearted person will find in these experiences a justification for the withholding of tithe funds or for appropriating them as he thinks best unless he can qualify as one to whom god has through special instruction guided a course divergent from that so clearly set forth in the many e g white published counsels is he not dutybound to adhere to those counsels responsibility concerning the tithe confused with personal responsibility in the matter of freewill offerings in several instances in privatelyissued publications reproducing the letter written by mrs white to the conference president in 1905 other exhibits are presented which would seem to lend support to the idea that in the matter of the tithe each individual is alone responsible to god and is to seek the counsel of no man short quotations removed from their setting and placed in proximity to statements relating to the tithe would seem to countermand the clear counsels which appear in the e g white books it should be noted that the principal exhibit is taken from a document not generally accessible today here is the quotation as it has been privately published in several tractsthe lord has made us individually his stewards we each hold a solemn responsibility to invest our means ourselves god does not lay upon you the burden of asking the conference or any council of men whether you shall use your means as you see fit to advance the work of god  special testimonies to battle creek pp 41 42 in these two sentencesactually quite widely separated in the original tractno mention is made of the tithe in these sentences mrs white is not writing page 34about the tithe nor is she writing about our regular offerings the statements concern the responsibility of the author of literary productions in the stewardship of his royalties from his published work the setting is the same as that of the article entitled the author found in testimonies for the church vol 7 pp 176180 perhaps we should review briefly the historical backgrounds most authors receive remuneration for their literary work from a royaltya certain percentage of the sale price of each book when a publisher accepts a manuscript for publication he usually does so on this basis this plan has been followed in our denomination from its beginning days there came a time in the mid1890s when some of our publishing houses reasoned that the organization was in a much better position to know the needs of the cause than the author of a book and they urged authors to either give their manuscripts to the publishing house or to accept a very modest lump sum payment then whatever success might come to the book would in turn benefit the publishing house and not the author ellen white pointed out that this was unjust and that the author should receive his due royalties at the same time she pointed out to the author that his royalty income was not his to use as he might please but that he was a steward for god the lord had given him special talents and if the lord in blessing those talents brought financial benefit to the author the author was to recognize his stewardship in the use of such funds sister white addressed several communications to the brethren on this point and it is from one of these communications which appeared in special instruction relating to the review and herald office and the work in battle creek that the parts of three sentences in question are extracted on page 38 of this pamphlet mrs white wrote as an introductioni have borne abundant testimony setting forth the fact that the ability to write a book is like every other talent a gift from god for which the possessor is accountable to him this talent no man can buy or sell without incurring great and dangerous responsibility then from page 40 and onward we quote in their fuller setting the sentences in question placing them in italics to identify them because the tract is not generally accessible we quote quite fullyit is not our property that is entrusted to us for investment if it had been we might claim discretionary power we might shift the responsibility upon others and leave our stewardship with others but this we cannot do because the lord is testing us individually if we act wisely in trading upon our lords goods and multiplying the talents given us we shall invest this gain for the master praying for wisdom that we may be divested of all selfishness and laboring most earnestly to advance the precious truth in our world some men or councils may say that is just what we wish you to do the conference committee will take your capital and will appropriate it for this very object the lord has made us individually his stewards we each hold a solemn responsibility to invest this means ourselves a portion it is right to place in the treasury to advance the general interests of the work but the steward of means will not be guiltless before god unless so far as he is able to do this he shall use that means as circumstances shall reveal the necessity we should be ready to help the suffering and to set in operation plans to advance the truth in various page 35ways it is not in the providence of the conference or any other organization to relieve us of this stewardship if you lack wisdom go to god ask him for yourself and then work with an eye single to his glory by exercising your judgment by giving where you see there is need in any line of the work you are putting out your money to the exchangers if you see in any locality that the truth is gaining a foothold and there is no place of worship then do something to meet the necessity by your own action encourage others to act in building a humble house for the worship of god have an interest in the work in all parts of the field while it is not your own property that you are handling yet you are made responsible for its wise investment for its use or abuse god does not lay upon you the burden of asking the conference or any council of men whether you shall use your means as you see fit to advance the work of god in destitute towns and cities and impoverished localities if the right plan had been followed so much means would not have been used in some localities and so little in other places where the banner of truth has not been raised we are not to merge our individuality of judgment into any institution in our world we are to look to god for wisdom as did daniel age after age jesus has been delivering his goods to his church at the time of the first advent of christ to our world the men who composed the sanhedrin exercised their authority in controlling men according to their will if mens wills were always submerged into gods will this would be safe but when men are separated from god and their own wisdom is made a controlling power the souls for whom christ has given his life to free from the bondage of satan are brought under bondage to him in another form do we individually realize our true position that as gods hired servants we are not to bargain away our stewardship but that before the heavenly universe we are to administer the truth committed to us by god our own hearts are to be sanctified our hands are to have something to impart as occasion demands of the income that god entrusts to us the humblest of us have been entrusted with talents and made agents for god using our gifts for his names glory it is the duty of everyone to realize his own responsibility and to see that his talents are turned to advantage as a gift that he must return having done his best to improve it he who improves his talents to the best of his ability may present his offering to god as a consecrated gift that will be as fragrant incense before him a savor of life unto life  special instruction relating to the review and herald office and the work in battle creek pp 4043 the merchant carries a responsibility as a steward for the lord he is responsible for the way in which he uses his profits from his business after he has paid a faithful tithe the farmer is responsible to god for his use of the means the lord entrusts to him these were not to transfer to someone else the responsibility of the use of the means which god gave to them and this was so with the author it has nothing whatsoever to do with the tithe but it was dealing with the principle of stewardship in general and it is a gross misuse of the parts of three sentences to put them together as has been done in several privately published tracts page 36another case of gross distortion top of this sectionanother case in which mrs whites words relating to freewill gifts are erroneously applied to the tithe is found in some of these privately published tracts in close proximity to the sentences dealt with above here is the statement and its supposedlysupporting quotation taken from the testimoniesbefore the lord directed sister white where to pay her tithe she for a while paid tithe to the seventh day adventist publishing association later on she could not conscientiously do so for she writes when means has been pressed upon me i have refused it or appropriated it to such charitable objects as the publishing association i shall do so no more 1t 678 taken from page 5 of a privately published tract in this statement penned in 1868 mrs white is not speaking of the tithe in any sense this is made clear by reading the sentences quoted in their context in the full paragraph it is found to be in the setting of the distressing experience of the mistreatment of hannah more mrs white declaredwe see outcasts widows orphans worthy poor and ministers in want and many chances to use means to the glory of god the advancement of his cause and the relief of suffering saints and i want means to use for god the experience of nearly a quarter of a century in extensive traveling feeling the condition of those who need help qualifies us to make a judicious use of our lords money i have bought my own stationery paid my own postage and spent much of my life writing for the good of others and all i have received for this work which has wearied and worn me terribly would not pay a tithe of my postage when means has been pressed upon me i have refused it or appropriated it to such charitable objects as the publishing association i shall do so no more i shall do my duty in labor as ever but my fears of receiving means to use for the lord are gone this case of sister more has fully aroused me to see the work of satan in depriving us of means  1t 678 679 here mrs white points out that when those who had been benefited by her patient toil in writing out what the lord had revealed to her for them and they wished to give her something by way of remuneration she had refused or if it was accepted she did not keep it but gave it to such organizations as the publishing association now as she saw the pressing needs about her she declared that she would accept such gifts and use the money to help the needy there is no reference here at all to tithe the discovery of such use of the spirit of prophecy writings should lead all to approach privately published tracts with great caution and should underscore the absolute necessity of looking up in the full setting every ellen g white quotation employed but this is not all not satisfied with this clear distortion the author of the privately published tract referred to here after the brief distorted statement just given addswhy she could not conscientiously pay her tithe to the publishing of seventh day adventist literature any more is seen better by a testimony given out later on i feel a terror of soul as i see to what a pass our publishing house has come the presses in the lords institution have been printing the souldestroying theories of romanism and other mysteries of iniquity this is taking all page 37sacredness from the office the managers are loading the guns of the enemy and placing them in their hands to be used against the truth how does god regard such work in the books of heaven are written the words unfaithful stewardship thus god regards the publication of matter which comes from satans manufactoryhis hellish scientific delusions mrs e g white in a solemn warning read to the review and herald board in november 1901 published by the pacific press oakland california 1903 we have pointed out that the tithe is in no sense involved mrs white stated in 1868 that because of the pressing needs of those about her she would use funds given to her not as a gift to the publishing house but to help the destitute but the writer of the privately published tract first removing from its context the 1868 e g white statement i shall do so no more unequivocally declares that the shift in mrs whites liberalities was because of the type of literature published at the review office and quotes a 1901 statement in support concerning the objectionable literature published for a brief period in the review office we have ample information in testimonies vol 7 pp 164168 it was not until the early 1890s that this problem arose a full 25 years after mrs white wrote her statement regarding the objectives of her liberalities surely such falsehood and gross distortion of the spirit of prophecy writings should alert readers to the true objectives of those who make such use of the precious counsels which mean so much to the church to all who really wish to know what mrs white has actually taught we would urge the reading of the spirit of prophecy counsels in the e g white books themselves rather than in privately issued tracts and mimeographed sheets march 1959 revised february 1990page 38 top of this section table of contentsappendix athe use of the tithe table of contents manuscript 82 1904 a basic source of ellen g whites 9t 248251 statement thou shalt command the children of israel that they bring thee pure olive oil beaten for the light to cause the lamp to burn always this was to be a continual offering that the house of god might be properly supplied with that which was necessary for his service his people today are to remember that the house of worship is the lords property and that it is to be scrupulously cared for but the funds for this work are not to come from the tithe the tithe is to be used for one purposeto sustain the ministers whom the lord has appointed to do his work it is to be used to support those who speak the words of life to the people and carry the burden of the flock of god but there are ministers who have been robbed of their wages gods provision for them as not been respected those who have charge of our church buildings are to be supplied with the means that is necessary to keep these buildings in good repair but this money is not to come from the tithe a very plain definite message has been given to me to give to our people i am bidden to tell them that they are making a mistake in applying the tithe to various objects which though good in themselves are not the object to which the lord has said that the tithe is to be applied those who make this use of the tithe are departing from the lords arrangement god will judge for these things one reasons that the tithe may be appropriated to school purposes still others would reason that canvassers and colporteurs should be supported from the tithe but a great mistake is made when the tithe is drawn from the object for which it is to be usedthe support of the ministers there should today be in the field one hundred well qualified laborers where now there is but one god cannot look upon the present condition of things with approval but with condemnation his treasury is deprived of the means that should be used for the support of the gospel ministry in fields nigh and afar off those who proclaim the message of truth before great congregations and who do housetohouse work as well are doing double missionary work and in no case are their salaries to be cut down the use of the tithe must be looked upon as a sacred matter by our people we must guard strictly against all that is contrary to the message now given there is a lack of ministers because ministers have not been encouraged some ministers who have been sent to foreign lands to enter fields never worked before have been given the instruction you must sustain yourselves we have not the means with which to support you this ought not to be and it would not be if the tithe with gifts and offerings was brought into the treasury when a man enters the ministry he is to be paid from the tithe enough to sustain his family he is not to feel that he is a beggar page 6the impression is becoming quite common that the sacred disposition of the tithe no longer exists many have lost their sense of the lords requirements the tithe is sacred reserved by god for himself it is to be brought into his treasury to be used to sustain the gospel laborers in their work for a long time the lord has been robbed because there are those who do not realize that the tithe is gods reserved portion many ministers are lying in their graves brought there by sorrow and disappointment and by the hardship brought upon them because they did not receive sufficient for their labors let us remember that god is a god of justice and equity there would today be many more ministers in the field but they are not encouraged to labor many workers have gone into the grave heartbroken because they had grown old and could see that they were looked upon as a burden but had they been retained in the work and given an easy place with a whole or part of their wages they might have accomplished much good during their term of labor these men have done double labor they felt so heavy a burden for souls that they had no desire to be relieved of overwork the heavy burdens borne shortened their lives the widows of these ministers are never to be forgotten but should if necessary be paid from the tithe read carefully the third chapter of malachi and see what god says about the tithe if our churches will take their stand upon the lords word and be faithful in paying their tithe into his treasury his laborers will be encouraged to take up ministerial work more men would give themselves to the ministry were they not told of the depleted treasury there should be an abundant supply in the lords treasury and there would be if selfish hearts and hands had not made use of the tithe to support other lines of work gods reserved resources are to be used in no such haphazard way the tithe is the lords and those who meddle with it will be punished with the loss of their heavenly treasure unless they repent let the work no longer be hedged up because the tithe has been diverted into various channels other than the one to which the lord has said it should go provision is to be made for these other lines of work they are to be sustained but not from the tithe god has not changed the tithe is to be used for the support of the ministry the opening of new fields requires more ministerial efficiency than we now have and there must be means in the treasury ms 82 1904 page 40 table of contents top of this sectionappendix bwhere should i pay my tithe

over the role and function of the organized world church of seventhday adventists since we are a biblebased church we believe that israels experience with organization and tithing can provide sound insights to assist modern adventists in resolving such questions old testament experience top of this sectionwe begin our survey with israels experience in the time of the judges 14001050 b c an epoch of anarchy in those days observed the chronicler there was no king in israel every man did what was right in his own eyes judges 2125  there was little pulling together for the common good by contrast the establishment of a monarchy brought a sense of unity national consciousness and purpose it brought identity and coherence to israels religious faith and civil institutions when israels kings governed under god following the organizational pattern laid down by moses the national interests were best served and the people prospered both spiritually and materially this prosperity provided an appealing showcase attracting the surrounding nations to the true god see deut 458 order is the law of heaven it is seen in all gods works israels support system top of this sectionisraels monarchal government as a theocracy meant that religious faith was intimately linked with civil life undergirding the priestly temple ministration and the national religion lay the divinely appointed financial plan of tithing the practice of rendering to god a tithe or tenth of ones increase in material goods appears as a definite part of the patriarchal religion from time immemorial see gen 1420 2822 the patriarchs probably used the tithes in special sacrifices and feasts to the lord although on one occasion abraham gave a tithe of the spoils of war to melchizedek a priest of the true god in canaan at the establishment of the israelite nation sanctuary and priesthood god reaffirmed his right to the tithe all the tithe of the land whether of seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees is the lords it is holy to the lord    and all the tithe of herds and flocks every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsmans staff shall be holy to the lord lev 273032 now however the lord directed that the tithe should form the major basis for the financial support of the tribe of levi which receiving no home territory in canaan was appointed to care for the religious needs of the nation num 182124 the levites living in the 48 cities allotted to them throughout the tribal territoriesnum 35 7 periodically gathered the tithes from the people they in turn tithed what they received and brought this tithe of the tithe to the sanctuary storehouse chamber where it was redistributed to the priests and in later years to other levitical personnel who served in the sanctuary service and worship see num 182628 this financial plan probably did not function at all in the period of the judges we know that it lapsed at times during the monarchal era but in periods of spiritual revival we catch glimpses of its operation one of these occurred under king hezekiah of judah 2 chron 31219 in response to the kings command to give the portion due to the priests and levites verse 4 the tithe of everything verse 5 began to flow into the temple storehouse azariah the high page 41priest exclaimed to the inquiring king since they began to bring the contributions into the house of the lord we have eaten and had enough and plenty left verse 10 this heartening news prompted hezekiah to enlarge the storage areas and appoint officers to oversee the regular distribution of this support to their brethren levites old and young alike by divisions verse 15 see also verses 1119 when nehemiahappointed governor over the reestablished nation of judah fifth century b cled the jews into a renewal of their covenant with god see neh 938 he also led them to a commitment to revive the tithing system to bring to the levites the tithes from our ground for it is the levites who collect the tithes in all our rural towns and the priest the son of aaron shall be with the levites when the levites receive the tithes and the levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our god to the chambers to the storehouse  we will not neglect the house of our god neh 103739 cf 1244 during nehemiahs temporary absence from judah neh 136 however the national purpose lapsed the people backslid on his return he remonstrated with the leadership why is the house of god forsaken verse 11 once more the tithing system was restored officers were reappointed to oversee distribution and judah brought the tithe of the grain wine and oil into the storehouses verse 12 in nehemiahs second period of governorship god challenged his people through the prophet malachi will man rob god yet you are robbing me but you say how are we robbing thee in tithes and offerings you are cursed with a curse for you are robbing me the whole nation of you mal 38 9 following this severe criticism god once more appeals to his people bring the full tithes into the storehouse that there may be food in my house verse 10 from this overview of the biblical data we find it evident that the levitical worship was amply underwritten by a tithing system that operated on a storehouse principle no one chose to give his tithe to a particular priest or group of priests on the contrary all the tithes of israel were gathered by the levites who in turn brought a tithe of these goods and moneys to the storehouse areas of the temple at this location appointed officers distributed sustenance in a regular manner and in proper amounts to the priests and other levitical attendants who ministered directly in the service of the temple this national pulling together provided a coordinated support for the temple personnel who gave full time to their respective spiritual ministries adventists organization and tithing top of this sectionearly sabbathkeepers were reluctant at first to move in the direction of organization but as the sabbath message spread it became clear that no real advance could be made if every man did what was right in his own eyes ellen white summarized the reason our pioneers organized the seventhday adventist church in the 1860sas our numbers increased it was evident that without some form of organization there would be great confusion and the work would not be carried forward successfully to provide for the support of the ministry for carrying the work in new fields for protecting both the churches and the ministry from unworthy members for holding church property for the publication of the truth through the press and for many other objects organization was indispensable  testimonies to ministers p 26 pressed to keep ministers in the field fulltime our pioneers sought to develop an adequate financial system for the organizing church as early as 1858 a bible class in battle creek under the direction of j n andrews began to search for bible principles of gospel support the class eventually recommended a plan known as systematic benevolence the predecessor of the present system of tithes and offerings not until 18761879 however did adventists institute a fullfledged tithing system adapted from the levitical model as the basis for denominational finance leaders encouraged members to adopt the tithing plan as gods ordained arrangement for the support of the ministry and the work of the church tithes gathered in the churches were remitted to the conferences for the support of the ministers in their respective territories the conference was designated as the storehouse for the tithes the conference passed on a tithe of these page 42tithes to the general conference over the years this storehouse principle has been refined so that tithe now flows from local churches to the conference with certain percentages moving on to the union conference and finally to the general conference with its oversight of the world field the steady growth and extension of the seventhday adventist churchfrom 3500 members in the united states in 1863 to more than 5 million worldwide today and from a small u s area to a presence in more than 180 countrieshas demonstrated under gods blessing the soundness of the storehouse principle of the levitical system the church succeeds when it pulls together toward a common goal selfsupporting units and the organized work top of this sectionapproximately 40 years after the organization of the adventist church there appeared a new form of lay endeavor the selfsupporting unit begun in 1904 the nashville agricultural and normal institute corporation the parent organization for madison college and madison hospital became the forerunner of scores of similar units that assisted in developing the work in the southern area of the united states today approximately 700 selfsupporting units and independent businesses with similar objectives as madison function under the general conference umbrella organization known as asi adventistlaymens services and industries international usually selfsupporting groups view themselves as adjuncts to the organized church actually the adventist church itself provides the reason for their existence composed of dedicated selfsacrificing men and women selfsupporting units have enlarged and furthered the cause of truth through the years by a variety of means such as schools and medical missionary endeavors selfsupporting units were never intended to spend their energies turning inward on the church to challenge publicly its doctrines to critique its endeavors or to prey on its tithes on the contrary such units were intended to uphold the church and to extend its influence like aaron and hur who held up the hands of moses in the battle of israel against the amalekites ex 17816 unfortunately some independent ministries not under the asi umbrella openly accept tithe funds from church members and argue that the storehouse principle is invalid like disaffected persons who have given up the adventist faith leaders of these ministries point to the flaws and failures in the church as reasons why members should divert their tithe to themalthough they themselves are accountable to no one such independent groups sometimes appeal to the example of ellen white as their defense for accepting the lords tithe ellen white and the tithe top of this sectionas one of the pioneers ellen white encouraged organizing the adventist church and fully endorsed through teaching and practice the system of tithing on the storehouse plan in the early years before medical and sustentation plans existed she by the lords direction occasionally assisted ministers both black and white who were in dire straits from her personal tithe in another situation she cautioned a conference president against making an issue of a gift of tithe from some members of his conference to the southern missionary society which supervised the struggling work in the southern united states eventually it became a regular practice for strong conferences to share a percentage of their tithe with weaker conferences for a detailed account of ellen whites use of the tithe see arthur l white ellen white the early elmshaven years pp 389397 none of these exceptions provide a basis for members to divert the lords tithe from its intended use to independent ministries or selfsupporting units ellen white addressed the questions posed at the beginning of this article for they were raised in her day also let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe to use according to their own judgment they are not to use it for themselves in an emergency nor to apply it as they see fit even page 643in what they may regard as the lords work    some have been dissatisfied and have said i will not longer pay my tithe for i have no confidence in the way things are managed at the heart of the work but will you rob god because you think the management of the work is not right make your complaint plainly and openly in the right spirit to the proper ones send in your petitions for things to be adjusted and set in order but do not withdraw from the work of god and prove unfaithful because others are not doing right  testimonies vol 9 pp 247249 read the book of malachi    cannot you see that it is not best under any circumstances to withhold your tithes and offerings because you are not in harmony with everything your brethren do    unworthy ministers may receive some of the means thus raised but dare anyone because of this withhold from the treasury and brave the curse of god i dare not i pay my tithes gladly and freely saying as did david of thine own have we given thee kjv    do not commit sin yourselves by withholding from god his own property    do not by your neglect of duty increase our financial difficulties special testimonies series a no 1 pp 52 53 our global challenge top of this sectionseventhday adventists recognize the good work other christians are doing however we are committed to the divine leading that brought about the birth and organization of the advent movement to carry out the mission symbolized by the angels of revelation 14614 and 1814 while the truth is perfect in jesus neither the leadership nor the laity of this movement will ever be perfect the wheat always will be mingled with tares see matt 132430 3643 the church will always have its judases but the prophecies foreshadow no new organizations to come no more angels to fly this is the time of the end the present advent movement has been appointed to accomplish this revelation mission our urgent commission allows no room for disorganized approaches and haphazard moves with every man doing what is right in his own eyes there is only one place for the lords tithes to be deposited the storehouse of the church for adventists no other use of the tithe is admissible god expects his people to press together spiritually and pull together financially to accomplish his objectives the global task of the church is many times greater than ancient israels in underwriting the temple with so large a challenge before us let every minister and member enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of nehemiah we will not neglect the house of our god neh 1039  unless otherwise noted bible quotations in this article are from the revised standard version
