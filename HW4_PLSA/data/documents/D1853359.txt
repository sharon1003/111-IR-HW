easy cheap animated cartoon in 10 minutesby leevonk in art download 5 steps share favorite i made itcollection i always liked to draw and was thinking of becoming a cartoonist as a kid but the tedium of the technique at the time 1980s drove me away now we have computers and everyone is making flash animations flash attracted me because you dont have to redraw the thing every frame you just move its pieces however this severly restricts the expressiveness of ones creations also you have to draw on a computer using a mouse or drawing tablet neither of which worked ever gave me the results i wanted so i tried claymation because this allows expressiveness without having to redraw the character each frame problem with this is the clay is hard to work with and a pain finally i came up with a very easy and fun way to do animations which can be both expressive do not require redrawing of the whole character each frame and allow very easy modification without messy erasing and without having to use a computer mouse or computer drawing tablet for this method all you need is a dry erase board whiteboard a usb camera a computer and some free software step 1 get your stuff together you will need  one or more dry erase boards more than one is nice because you can do multiple scenes at the same time without erasing the same board over and over  a usb camera i use a logitech quickcam chat its cheap and does the job it also comes with a weird bendy mount which allows me to mount it on a tripod that i have  a computer any old computer will work as long as it can run the software see below  some free software i use monkey jam to make the initial animations its free and its great does everything you need to make nice animations httpwwwgiantscreamingrobotmonkeyscommonkeyjamdownloadhtml i use video edit magic to do the post animation editing adding music sound effects naration etc its a very cheap simple and effective program step 2 set everything up so set up the whiteboard on a table tape it down with double sided tape wo it wont shift while you draw and erase on it mount the usb camera above it in a stable position its best to make some sort of mount that you can keep in place permanently or at least for the time that it takes you to do your animation if it gets shifted in reference to the whiteboard its annoying to reposition it to the exact same position and then your animation will have a jump in it i mounted my webcam on an old tripod that i foun on the street i think the tripod was used for a high hat on a drum set you will probably not want to mount the webcam more than about a foot above the whiteboard cause their resolution isnt that great plug the camera into your computer and start monkey jam step 3 working with the software start monkey jam free software mentioned with url in step 2 click the button on the upper left piece of paper with a star on it this will create a new layer in your animation just click ok in the box that comes up an orange labeled layer will appear click the open video capture window button the thing to the right of the 10 button in the window that pops up select stop motion under the mode menu select your camera from the cameras menu then start drawing and click the capture button whenever you want to make a new frame in your animation step 4 working with the software cntdyou can check how your movie is looking so far bly clicking the preview movie button when youre satisfied with your movie click the exposure sheet as an avi movie button step 5 put your animations onto youtube i was messing with windows movie maker comes with windows and i noticed a narate button use that to add voicessound to your animations once they have been saved as videos you can also use windows movie maker for basic editing add effects etc alternatively you can download virtual dub from downloadcom its free and allows basic video editing  put your animations onto you tube so people can watch them there arent many aninamtions by nonprofessionals on there at the moment i hope this will change after this instructable here are some excellent books on animation how to draw cartoon animals how to draw real animals film directing shot by shot script writing etc  here are some short animations i did so far httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvo

the nintendo dsi flipnote studio anonbonbon reply20100409this is great thanks alot hey could this technique possibly be transfered over to digital like using photoshop or a similar program and simply keep duplicating the layer and erasing and replacing the moving parts probably would take longer but would be better for things that had to look like cartoons like a fananimation for an anime or something just a suggestion ill have to test it first again great job explaining this im gonna use this technique for a few of my first animationsreverser514 reply20090913you can do the exact same thing with windows movie makerdungeon runner reverser514 reply20100407yes but you have to add and shorten every single frame in the damn video then there is the fact that the program and the videos it makes are extremely slow i dont see the downside of downloading something specifically made for the purpose of animating ywhales reply20100130what you could do they used to do this back in the old days might be the 80s frame you talk about is that would draw the more same things like background static objects on wax paper or seethough we then when youre ready for a shot you just lay the sheets over whats moving that way you can actually keep things for later its pretty obvious if you ever watch old scooby doo cartoons the things that move are drawn with less detail and usally in slightly brighter shades institoris reply20070310you see i made this a month agoi think for a girl in my class i know its not the perfect animation and that there might be some problems with the animation
