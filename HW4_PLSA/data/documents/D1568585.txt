box turtles do turtle shells peel by lianne mc leod dvmupdated 040918share pin email james de mers  pixabay  cc by 0a turtles shell is comprised of about 60 bones the outside is layered in scutes which are platelike scales similar to the keratin composition of fingernails they protect the bones and cartilage of the shell underneath turtles do shed pieces of their shell like many other reptiles but unlike snakes they arent shedding their skin a turtle wont actually leave his shell because its fused to the rest of his body a peeling shell can also indicate disease depending on the type of turtle and its health reason for scute shedding shedding of the scutes is a routine process during which they peel and flake off and are replaced by new ones this occurs as part of the turtles normal growth as the shell expands with the rest of the growing body even grown turtles shed their scutes especially ones that spend a lot of time in the water this enables the turtle to get rid of shell rot and parasitic infections that can result from spending too much time in the water and not enough on dry land box turtles and snapping turtles who dont spend much time in the water dont shed their scutes as often when they do it is mainly part of a healing process peeling as part of the growth process if normal as long as thin almost transparent layers come off the peeling scutes should reveal shell that looks and feels normal other reasons for shell shedding other reasons why a turtle will peel its shell include overfeeding and growing too fast basking in an area where its getting too hot fungal infections high ammonia levels in the water its important to have a good filter with biological filtration various diseases when peeling indicates a problem it is important to determine if the shell under peeling scutes looks normal anytime the shell looks deformed red bone is exposed or the shell feels soft or spongy there is a problem and medical advice should be sought as quickly as possible if your turtle is continuously shedding scutes or the scutes are peeling but not falling completely off you should see a vet recognizing healthy shedding scutes should generally be intact and whole and not come off in parts if they dont it could be a sign of disease sharp rocks can cause a turtle to prematurely shed scutes or damage them to ensure that nothing in the environment is potentially dangerous scutes should not be very thick and they should appear almost translucent essentially they should look like the shell that they came off of its normal for a turtle to eat some of its scutes after they fall off to be safe remove discarded scutes from the tank as they could damage your turtles throat and internal organs skin shedding in addition to shedding scutes a turtle will shed its skin as well a turtles skin is different from that of a person because its not elastic and it doesnt stretch to allow for growth as certain turtles grow youll see that they outgrow and shed their soft skin in stages this is most common in aquatic turtles and it also serves as a way to stave off infections
