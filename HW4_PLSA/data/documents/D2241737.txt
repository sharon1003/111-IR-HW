session launch the clock app and select timer set the timer for the amount of time that you would like your child to have access to the device for in hours and minutes also check that in sounds i pad that stop playing is selected if it is not select that option if you are using an i phone or i pod the when timer ends display shows this information make sure it displays stop playing press start and give the device to the user after the timer runs out the device will bring up the lock screen if a passcode lock is set then the user will not be able to get access to the device without entering it the clock app could also be used to transition students with special needs when in the clock app this can be done by selecting sounds at the topleft of the screen when timer ends in i phonei pod select an option for a sound you want your childstudents to hear as the timer finishes this sound will be played every time the timer is activated but the device will not lock when a sound option is selected if you use this feature as a sharing timer you will need to activate the timer again for the next session simple what if i don’t have passcode lock set you can set a passcode lock by following the steps below click the settings icon on the home screen from the lefthand sidebar select general from the righthand sidebar select passcode lock when the passcode lock screen is displayed
