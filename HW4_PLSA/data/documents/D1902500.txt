or gleasons favorite soloist gleason himself was a big fan of the trumpetcornet and on occasion messed around with it from time to time his favorite solo player was the very mellow bobby hackett the two had a long recording relationship but the lead player on his old tv show and on the numerous recordings that gleason produced whould be interesting to know i was very young and had not yet adopted the trumpet and was always wowed each week to hear the opening moments of gleasons hip and bluesy tv show theme that featured a trumpet with orchestra playing a simple but effective chromatic figure very cool but i dont think that was hackett it should be noted too that these shows were always live and never edited the tv audiences saw these shows litterally as they were happening including the

first 50 years of cbs television i checked it out and listened i was great to hear the theme music from so many great shows the theme from the jackie gleason show is on the cd i hadnt heard it in years i fondly recall watching that show with my dad i was suprised to read in the liner notes that the theme was composed by jackie gleason was he a musician did he play an instrument did he compose

subject ill second the vote that it might be bobby hackett he played for quite a while on the jackie gleason show i think i had the good fortune of hearing him play live when i was in junior high just a year or two before he passed away he had incredible control of the instrument and was more of a melodic sweet player not really overpowering as i remember my father also introduced me to him backstage after the show he told me that he practiced more than 6 hours each day to play the way he did when you tell that to a 7th grade trumpet player who also likes to play baseball thats kind of a turnoff imagine if i had started practicing 6 hours a day back then where would i be today anyway its not too late im off to the hornback to top dave hheavyweight member joined 20 nov 2001 posts

recordings in the 1950s they are now available on cd bobby hackett was a featured trumpetcornet soloist on some of those gleasons haunting theme song melancholy serenade is one of the selections on the cd how sweet it is by the jackie gleason velvet brass emicapitol re 21112this is an incredible all brass orchestra recording from april 9 1957 it was only the third stereo recording done by capitol records the first being stan kenton in hifi and then nat king coles love is the thing toots mondello solos on alto sax while the brass is an absolute study in perfection melancholy serenade makes me wonder whatever happened to vibrato that song would lose its soul without that big fat trumpet vibrato when gleason did his live saturday night variety show from miami beach florida in the 60s remember the opening live from miami beach its the jackie gleason show then orchestra begins melancholy serenade he would load a train in new york city with the entire cast and production crew and head south it was one big party all the way down and all the way back to new york jackie even hired a dixieland band to entertain everyone on the train trip he was especially fond of dixieland jazz so many great shows were televised live and had such fabulous orchestras kids today have no concept of the magnitude of live music 40 and 50 years ago television may have been in its infancy in the 50s but imho it had a lot more class and brass jackie gleason will always be one of my very favorite entertainers because he was a guy who really knew how to have a good time how sweet it is back to
