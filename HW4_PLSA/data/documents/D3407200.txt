how can i uninstall or remove twrp from my device apr 11 2018for the vast majority of devices you dont actually remove twrp to get back to the stock recovery installing a different recovery is your only real option simply install whatever recovery that you want and that will overwrite or replace twrp usually you can follow the instructions on our website for installing twrp manually only use the file for whatever recovery you are choosing to install instead of the twrp file note we dont keep or maintain a database of stock recoveries if you are trying to reinstall the stock recovery you will have to find a copy of the stock recovery on your own
