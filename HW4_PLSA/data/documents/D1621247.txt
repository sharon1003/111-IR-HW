most attractive facial shape what affects head shape it is interesting to see these different classification of facial shape and my current area of research that shows just how intimately the shape of our faces are affected by our lifestyle which face is most aesthetic i think most will look at the art and pick the top left the oval shape as that appears most normal or least exotic but if you compare oval shape face to square shape face which one has the more wider and horizontal mandible which one has the more defined cheekbones i would argue that the square shape face has the best structure out of all facial shapes and it is the one that chewed more than anybody else growing up notice how the oval shaped face has the lower jaw that is slimmer and tapers to a point this is sign of narrowing of the mandible as well as mandible hinging back because of vertical growth of maxilla i think there is a myth that favors slimmer jaws on women as having more elegance and beauty while this may have been true back in the old days when everyone had stronger jaws and the slim jaws were sign of wealth as money gave access to softer foods and it was also rare on basis of supply and demand the rare faces probably do get favored to a certain degree but in this modern world i think people are beginning to favor towards more broader faces now it is a sign of good development which is becoming the rare thing well at least in the western cultures as everyone was industrialized i have found that many plastic surgeons in asia especially korea create slim jaw faces and it seems to be the more preferred face over there snsd or girl generation is a famous girls band in korea which girl is the hottest i guess within asia the popular ones are5 yoona and 7 taeyeon from stand point of who has the best structure in my opinion it is 3 – sooyoung but she is not regarded as the most beautiful in the group by s korean standards3 – sooyoung has the broadest face amongst the members notice the distance between her eyes is the widest and you can see the broadness of her smile she has the most “square” face out of the members notice oval face of rest of the members the more oval the face the less distance between the eyes sooyoung’s broad face i believe makes her look more mature than other members with slimmer faces for example the popular 5 yoona and 7 taeyeon have slimmer jaws indicating they had more vertical growth this makes them look a bit more childlike which seems to be the preference in korea there seems to be more preference towards cuteness naivety and dependence as desirable qualities in women while 3 – sooyoung with imo better structure seems more independent and leader like it is interesting to note that in one of the interviews all of the members voted 3 – sooyoung as having the best natural beauty meaning the most beautiful without make up members commented that they are often shocked when looking at her waking up out of bed because she naturally looks beautiful make up covers up the downswing of maxilla here is group photo of them with less make up notice most members now begin to show bit of darkness under the eyes and the face became a bit more “plain” but what is interesting is sooyoung still seems to look just as good as before top row second from the leftit may be bit unfair because she’s smiling but again it is clear she has the wider face with a great wide smile yoona – who is regarded as one of the most beautiful of the group with less make up has dark circles under the eyes the maxilla has dropped down and the cheekbones are thin her tongue posture is low taeyeon – the stronger vocal of the team  quite popular the maxilla has dropped as evident by the flat frontal cheeks more vertical oriented lower jaw which shows weaker muscle tone sooyoung – girl that’s more closely approaching victoria secret type structure with wider broader face with more horizontal lower jaw i put her picture next to rosie huntington v secret super model to show the resemblance nice horizontal lower jaw – evidence of good muscle tone she’s the tallest member so it’s possible she ate more growing up causing her to chew more perhaps…sooyoung’s maxilla is further up and forward maxilla the cause of natural facial beauty it seems to determine the winner of better face when no make up is involved quite dramatically to study above picture is to understand the effect of maxilla on the face notice the difference in nose sizes because sooyoung has the better muscle tone that kept her maxilla up her nose is nice and small the distance between the eyes is wider because of it and she has more orbital support she will also have straighter teeth naturally the two girls to the left might of had ortho work done nose is bigger because as the maxilla fell it dragged the cartilage of the nose down it’s bit of a shame sooyoung is not regarded for her true beauty qualities it could be that korea is still relatively new developing country economically meaning not too long ago many of them still lived more natural farmer type lifestyle where people had more broad features so sooyoung is more representing traditional face of korea and as the country became modernized the new slim type of modern faces became more popular and regarded as more beautiful i see many older korea women up in the 50’s  often have these broad faces as i am sure their childhood was a lot different than modern times but in the west is the preference now towards more strong features for example many stars get involved with increasing volume in the cheeks and lower jaw to make the structure appear more defined so this means the square type of face is more desirable than the oval face our ancestors had square robust faces almost to insane levels as i have heard their intermolar width went up to 52 mm while modern average is 2833 mm with the occasional super rare greatly developed individual in the 42 mm range that often came from 3rd world countries because when your jaw muscles are very strong overtime it sort of crushes the skull and makes it wider when your jaw muscles are weak it begins to elongate traditional good looks are the square type of faces that looks good on a movie screen oval faces can look cute with make up but what makes the most aesthetic face the square jaw seems to be important meaning good muscle tone the cartoon artist is not truly representing the actual difference of a square face because he is not accounting for square faces havinglarger distance between the eyessmaller noseshorter facepossibly larger eyes as maxilla gives more support for the eyes he is showing that the side cheekbones are larger which is correct but again with simple drawing he is not able to express the difference in the front cheekbones quick opinion on how other faces are developed oblong – the person left their mouth open as a child and caused vertical growth of the maxilla when they got older they learned to keep their mouth closed and started developing some muscle tone that began to square off the lower jaw to make the face shorter again needs more extensive strengthening of jaw muscles and tongue posture correction round – the lower jaw is weak not very good muscle tone the person may have tongue between teeth posture causing vertical growth and suckle type of swallow where the cheek muscle is used to suck food down this is causing enlarged cheeks and the not the hollow cheeks adults are supposed to have pear – larger lower jaw than the round face better muscle tone could have the same improper swallow causing enlarged cheek muscle or obese diamond – low muscle tone and low tongue posture face is slimming down and going vertical heart – not entirely sure the cause of difference in forehead size but again low muscle tone leading to set back lower jaw the tongue posture may be good so the person may still have good front cheeks that support the eyes and midface but the lower jaw just melted away these are general speculations based on my current knowledge and not to be considered absolute truths studying each individual’s real face will serve better reading on what is actually going on because its the combination of few factors the main ones being 2 factors the balance between the biting muscle and the tongue posture  function conclusionin my opinion short square faces produces the most beautiful faces which requires a child to live a more natural lifestyle i have found that people that grew up on farms when they were younger a lot of time grow up as pretty attractive individuals like victoria secret model rosie huntington and this other girl i met the other day that had nice wide mandible great face and told me she grew up on a farm… i was thinking dang that makes a lot of sense…also i can think of several football players i met in college that grew up on farms all had broad faces on the farm you are gonna do a lot more outdoor activities and chores what does that do to the child give them hell of an appetite and farming household most likely live on more wholesome foods perhaps foods they get off the land and won’t need to go to the supermarket as often so less likely to have high calorie soft foods in the house like sugary treats that ruin appetite therefore the farmer child will be actually eating larger volumes of food compared to modern kids playing gameboy also chewing through more real foods with more fiber volume  fiber  a lot more masticatory effort over the course of few years this difference in lifestyle could make significant difference in jaw development direction of maxilla growth muscle tone and facial shapejoin membership to read more topics like this november 8 2014 claimingpower public
