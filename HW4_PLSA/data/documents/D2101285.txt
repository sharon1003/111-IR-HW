open access abstract tissue engineering is a radically new concept for the treatment of disease and injury it involves the use of the technologies of molecular and cell biology combined with those of advanced materials science and processing in order to produce tissue regeneration in situations where evolution has determined that adult humans no longer have innate powers of regeneration tissue engineering however along with some other aspects of regenerative medicine such as gene therapy has yet to deliver real successes in spite of a considerable science base and investment in the commercial infrastructure this article addresses the underlying issues of benefit and risk in tissue engineering in an attempt to understand why this situation has developed previous article next article there is an inherent virtuous logic to tissue engineering that sounds too good to be true by my definition tissue engineering is the persuasion of the body to heal itself achieved by the delivery to the appropriate site of cells biomolecules and supporting structures 1 it specifically involves the regeneration of new tissue to replace that which has become diseased or injured the significance of which is that we as adult humans do not normally possess this ability we may repair ourselves under some very limited circumstances for example bone fractures and injured skin may undergo repair but even when this does occur this usually involves nonspecific reparative tissue ie scar tissue rather than the regeneration of the specific functional tissue that has been affected the essence of tissue engineering is that those cells capable of initiating and sustaining the regeneration process are ‘switched on’ perhaps through growth factors or genes so that they generate new functional tissue of the required variety  fig 1  this may be achieved with the help of a scaffold or matrix to guide the geometrical or architectural shape of the new tissue and may take place on a customized basis at the site of the injury in an individual patient or on a more industrial scale in an ex vivo bioreactor where the resulting tissue construct is reimplanted into the patient download highres image 214kb download fullsize image fig 1 tissue engineering is concerned with the manipulation of cells which can be derived from many different sources in order for them to express the tissue that is required however cells interact with foreign surfaces in many ways and it is necessary to provide the right combination of signals to ensure the cells perform most appropriately this all sounds relatively straightforward but of course it is not in spite of a massive investment in the underlying science and scaleup procedures very few clinical conditions are being currently addressed by tissue engineering and commercial success has been very hard to achieve this article addresses the underlying factors that are encountered in the harsh reality of tissue engineering in doing so the actual and projected applications are mentioned first followed by an analysis of the gaps in our scientific knowledge and a discussion of the clinical regulatory ethical and commercial risks potential clinical opportunities whenever a new concept of medical therapy becomes available it is extremely important for it to be applied to the most relevant diseases and conditions where the expected benefits match as closely as possible the requirements of patients for a radically new concept such as tissue engineering this represents quite a challenge on the one hand there are very good prospects that tissue engineering could address medical conditions for which there are no existing successful therapies and it could be argued that it is on these conditions where the concept should be focused on the other hand these applications could be associated with high risks and the emerging area including the commercial infrastructure could be severely damaged if attempts at such highprofile highrisk conditions end in highly publicized failure the whole area of gene therapy a similar emerging technology within regenerative medicine suffered such a setback a few years ago with deaths in the usa and france 2 in describing potential clinical opportunities therefore it is necessary to consider situations of wideranging clinical benefits and risks the two types of tissue most commonly considered in tissue engineering products and processes are skin and cartilage as noted earlier skin is able to be repaired and to regenerate itself to some extent it is obvious however just by looking at an area of repaired skin that the resulting structure although providing a functional barrier between the internal tissues of the body and the outside world does not look nor feel like natural undamaged skin indeed it is usually scar tissue of quite different texture and appearance moreover there are many conditions where it is impossible for skin to repair or regenerate sufficiently well to give a clinically acceptable outcome the two main conditions here are where massive amounts of skin have been damaged as in burns injuries and in those situations where there are irreversible changes to the underlying vascularized tissue such that the skin is deprived of its nutrition source creating an ulcer a decubitus ulcer in the elderly eg bed sores or the common foot ulcer of the diabetic patient are good examples the first generation of commercially available tissue engineering products have attempted to address these areas of skin regeneration with some degree of success 3 with cartilage a relatively simple threedimensional connective tissue that has no intrinsic powers of regeneration there are a number of conditions where such regeneration could be of enormous benefit clinically the articular cartilage of joints such as the hip and knee suffers both degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis and trauma for example in sports injuries a great deal of attention has been paid to the replacement of diseased joints over the last several decades and medical device technology has produced a very effective portfolio of procedures and devices that are expected to give successful replacement of these joints in 90 of patients for at least ten years 4 it may well be that tissue engineering will enable the regeneration of diseased joints in the future but this is not seen as either technically feasible nor economically viable at this stage of more importance in tissue engineering is the possibility of faster effective treatment of small lesions arising from sports injuries where both of these technical difficulties are more easily overcome and the economic equation is reversed in addition one of the degenerative conditions in the body that is becoming increasingly common and significant from both individual quality of life and socioeconomic points of view is that of the spine especially intervertebral disks these are complex heterogeneous anisotropic structures composed mainly of cartilage and fluid damage to which is debilitating and difficult to repair effectively and permanently tissue engineering is widely seen as a potential vehicle for disk regeneration the spinal column is of course crucially important from the perspective of the spinal cord and it is well known that serious damage to this cord of nervous tissue results in permanent disability nerves whether of the central nervous system ie brain and spinal cord or the peripheral nerves are notoriously difficult to repair when soft tissue is cut the very small nerves within it may regenerate such that for example sensation gradually returns to tissue after an operation but there is a serious limitation to this and many injuries to nerves in the arms and legs are impossible to treat effectively nerve cells can grow under some conditions to produce a degree of function but they usually need considerable help and guidance to do so tissue engineering is addressing these problems by the use of nerve guides and growth factors in order to stimulate the timely and effective regeneration of nerves 5 some see this as potentially the most important area of tissue engineering involving as it does the introduction of a new therapeutic modality where none other exists perhaps of even more significance than injury to the central nervous system cns are the many types of neurodegenerative disease of which alzheimers and parkinsons are among the more common these are often discussed as target areas for tissue engineering and other regenerative medicine procedures although precisely how this could be achieved is a matter of debate there is insufficient space here to discuss all the potential applications of tissue engineering as it could be argued that most noninfectious and noncancerous diseases especially those involving congenitally absent or damaged tissues physically traumatized tissue and degenerative or metabolic conditions in the aged are potential targets it is appropriate to use as a final example those conditions that affect the central circulatory system since these are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in first world countries these include heart failure heart valve disease and atherosclerosis in the major circulation they epitomize the dilemma of the scientific and policy makers in tissue engineering taking heart valve disease as an example this represents a group of conditions that are lifethreatening but declining rather than increasing in incidence and for which there are effective although not perfect treatment modalities involving implantable medical devices already available and well proven as noted in a later section there will be profound risks involved with the use of a customized tissueengineered heart valve in patients such that taking into account the availability of alternatives the relative benefits may never outweigh the risks except possibly in some pediatric cases where current heart valve prostheses are not always effective in the longterm on the other hand with heart failure itself which may involve extensive damage to the heart muscle through a lack of blood supply following blockage of one or more coronary arteries effective treatments are not really available and the potential benefits of regeneration of the myocardium the muscular tissue of the heart are immense it has been demonstrated that the damage to the myocardium associated with an infarction a ‘heart attack’ may be reversible 6 and the delivery of the allimportant cardiomyocytes the cells of this tissue through a tissue engineering approach has considerable potential 7 the potential clinical benefits are wide ranging and very attractive before discussing the aspects of risk that have to be set against these benefits it is instructive to consider briefly the state of the science that underpins tissue engineering in order to see how realistic all of this is the status of tissue engineering it may be obvious from the above discussion that there are many potential methodologies by which the tissue engineering concept can be translated into clinical practice it is possible however to identify a central tissue engineering paradigm that describes the essential route from individual cells to regenerated tissue this route involves the phases of cell sourcing cell manipulation cell signaling tissue expression possibly within a bioreactor the implantation of the tissue construct into the host and its full effective incorporation into that host as far as the source of the cells is concerned there are many challenges including the most important question of all in tissue engineering leaving aside for the moment the use of animals as sources of cells since this practice as part of xenotransplantation is effectively banned throughout the world because of ethical and disease transmission issues we have two potential sources of cells those from the patient and those from a donor in the former case autologous cells as they are described could be the fully differentiated cells of the tissue in question that is chondrocytes to produce cartilage osteoblasts to produce bone glial cells to produce nerve tissue myocytes to produce muscle and so on alternatively they could be the patients stem cells derived from their own bone marrow or possibly their circulating blood which have been persuaded to differentiate into the required cells ie changed from stem cells into the required chondrocytes osteoblasts and so on an interesting alternative for the future here involves the harvesting of cord blood when a baby is born which is then stored at low temperature until required for a tissue engineering procedure later in life cells from donors are referred to as allogeneic cells which could be from a known individual but are more likely to be obtained from a commercial cell bank where cells from an original donor are cultured sorted and expanded to produce a readily available supply of standard quality cells of the required type these cells and the tissue they produce are of course foreign to the eventual hosts of the tissue engineering products to which they give rise an immensely important factor here is the possibility of using allogeneic stem cells which could in theory be adult fetal or embryonic there are many who would argue that embryonic stem cells offer the greatest potential here but there is a current moratorium on the use of embryonic stem cells for use in patients while there are strong demands for this to be made permanent with respect to reproductive technologies there are good arguments in favor of strictly controlled use of embryonic stem cells for regenerative therapies as noted very recently with the successful use of such cells in the cloning of human cells with potential in these therapies 8 the issues around cell manipulation and signaling can be treated together these concern the conditions in which the cells are grown such that they receive the right nutrients and signals to adopt andor retain the required characteristics referred to as the phenotype of the cell for the desired endpoint this is at the heart of the scientific basis of tissue engineering since these cells have to be stimulated to produce the required tissue because they are not intrinsically able to do so the signals are of two varieties molecular and mechanical molecular signals are usually but not necessarily growth factors a combination of the most appropriate factors and their concentration profile over time provide the essential key to cell behavior it is important to note here that many cells derived from normal adult human tissue may not be able to respond to such growth factors sufficiently well in normal culture to be of any practical value this may be addressed in two ways with an additional molecular signal or by mechanical signals the molecular signal may take the form of a gene which can be inserted into the cells to change some aspect of their character and increase the efficiency with which they carry out certain functions the performance of chondrocytes in culture can be radically altered by the transfer of socalled sox9 genes for example 9 it is with mechanical signaling that bioreactors and material scaffolds are introduced cells do not normally function in isolation or indeed within diffuse collections of cells alone they are found within an extracellular matrix and their behavior is regulated by signals that are passed between cells and their matrix one of the more important elements of this signaling between cells and the matrix involves mechanical forces and the behavior of cells is often dominated by the nature of these forces through a phenomenon known as mechanotransduction 10 in tissue engineering processes forces can be applied to cells through a fluid medium or by structural forces delivered by a substrate the fluid medium may be contained within a culture vessel which is known as a bioreactor 11 in the vast majority of tissue engineering processes cells are seeded into a porous scaffold within which they are provided with the molecular signals discussed above  fig 2  in addition their interaction with the scaffold material allows for the transmission of the forces from those surfaces the vast majority of scaffolds are made from biodegradable materials the degradation mechanisms of which are crucial in determining the outcome of tissue regeneration download highres image 445kb download fullsize image fig 2 scaffolds in this case a hyaluronic acid based material may be of many different forms including fibrous structures the physical and chemical characteristics of the scaffold control how cells behave and how they express the new tissue once the required volume of tissue has been generated through the activity of these cells it may be implanted into the recipient this is not a trivial point since there has to be complete and effective incorporation which implies integration of the new tissue within the vascular and nervous system of the host especially the development of the optimal blood supply through a process known as angiogenesis 12 and the control of any inflammatory or immune system responses 13 bearing in mind the complexity of all of these issues it is not surprising that although considerable progress has been made in a short period of time there are still many scientific issues to resolve among the most important of these are the questions that surround autologous cell expansion the maintenance of their phenotype and the optimization of their efficiency through gene transfection the development of effective nonviral vectors for gene transfection the control of differentiation of stem cells in the abnormal environment of bioreactors the control of tissue regeneration in cocultured heterogeneous anisotropic systems the optimization of mechanotransduction the procedures of immunomodulation with allogeneic cellderived products the optimization of vascularization and angiogenesis the control of inflammation during incorporation into the host and the determination of the functionality of regenerated tissue the general position relating to risk the questions of risk associated with tissue engineering have recently been discussed in detail by a committee of the european commission culminating in a report on this subject 14 the following is a summary of the main issues the basis of the report is the perception of the need for a careful analysis of the riskbenefit equation whenever a new concept of medical therapy is introduced into health care practice such that this analysis can inform the development of regulatory control and clinical experimentation it is of course necessary to put this into perspective tissue engineering does not carry the same level of risk as xenotransplantation since the risks are confined to the patients themselves and not to the community at large as may be the case when live potentially infectious animal cells are used it may also be argued that tissue engineering could be associated with less risk than conventional medical devices or medicinal products since the latter are massproduced and the hazards related to defective products or unforeseen mechanisms can affect thousands of patients tissue engineering is essentially a customized process that although involving some commercial components is directed towards individual patients minimizing the scale of the hazard on the other hand tissue engineering as with cell and gene therapy involves the manipulation of live cells and the interaction of these cells with substrates and biomolecules in unusual circumstances leading to the possibilities of contamination process errors and as yet unknown cellsubstrate interactions that could have serious consequences the analysis of risks and benefits has to take into account the fact that some applications carry very high risks for the patient but address immensely important clinical conditions while others are aimed at nonlifethreatening conditions for which there are already adequate treatment methods available in other words both risks and benefits vary considerably the nature of these risks to patients may be enumerated and summarized as follows •microbiological contamination associated with source materials including the possibility of latent viruses which may give rise to infectious diseases this may have to be addressed by the exclusion of certain types of donor for allogeneic products and the archiving of source material will be important•disease transmission where some disease states such as cancer blood disorders and genetic conditions will have to be considered•contamination associated with the production process generally of low risk and addressed by standard operating procedures and quality systems•the delivery of unwanted cells especially in coculture situations resulting in ineffective products•the risk of mixups especially with the use of autologous cells and the delivery of the resulting tissue to the wrong recipient•risks associated with the modification of cells during the processes of cell amplification or differentiation especially those involving genetic manipulation•risks inherently associated with the scaffold and with as yet unknown cellscaffold interactions it has to be said here that the development of scaffold materials has tended to follow on from the applications of materials in implantable medical devices which is not necessarily the best approach there are still many risks of underachievement with respect to the quality of regenerated tissue because of failures to understand the specific biocompatibility requirements of tissue engineering scaffolds 15•risks associated with the achievement of sterility of the final product which may be a complex combination of cells materials and biologically active agents•risks associated with the potential toxicity of cryopreservatives process additives and other residues as well as patientspecific responses such as allergies to antibiotics or other substances•risks associated with the performance of the final product there are risks that the regeneration process may not yield tissue with adequate mechanical or physical properties which could result in lifethreatening situations for example with tissueengineered blood vessels or valves final comment the combination of risks identified above contributes to the uncertainty that currently exists with respect to the commercial and clinical exploitation of tissue engineering it should be noted that during the last decade a number of companies have been formed with the objective of commercializing tissue engineering and at one time investment in these companies looked attractive however that tide has profoundly turned and there have been a number of high profile bankruptcies and changes in company positions over the last few years with little hope of recovering initial investments two fundamental issues are at play here 16 on the one hand the research and development costs are extremely high on the other there is little prospect of these companies being able to sell their products and processes for a reasonable sum even when they are in the market the treatments are usually labeled ‘investigational’ or ‘experimental’ which means that the treatments may not be reimbursable under most insurance schemes the question arises as to whether tissue engineering will ever be deemed cost effective it is likely for example that the cost of treating diabetic foot ulcers through a tissue engineering approach will run into the tens of thousands of dollars the cost of alternative treatments ie keeping the wound clean and applying wound dressings may amount to a few dollars per week we have therefore a situation in which the costs of the development of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine will have pharmaceutical dimensions but with rewards that will be similar to those associated with the conventional medical devices they are replacing the dilemma is easy to see the solutions lie within a complex array of technological political and socioeconomic factors the evolution of and interaction between which will be interesting to watch over the next
