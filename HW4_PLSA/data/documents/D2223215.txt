television roku doesnt provide any of the content  they just make a box that can receive it just like whoever made your tv doesnt provide you with any tv channels they just made a tv  the box costs under 100 and thats it  you own it just like your tv there are providers of content that the roku can receive the most well known is netflix but there are lots of others some charge a fee per month some dont usually the more valuable what they are showing you  the more likely it will cost you money hbo showtime cinemax etc dont stream yet and when they do start streaming theyre going to charge you to watch just like they charge your cable company for you to watch in other words hbo aint free you can also use your roku box as a media server to stream content you have on your computer to the box anyone that cant plugandplay a roku box really needs to stick with cable its just about the easiest piece of technology you could want to use you just plug the cables into your television router or wireless and connect online if you need turn it on and watch tv then thats called cable service examples of some of the services you can get with the roku box are here httpwwwrokucomrokuchannelstore there are also tons of private channels that unofficial creators make available  some free some not httpstreamfreetvappsrokuprivatec whether you can replace your cable depends entirely on what you watch on your cable i dont replace mine  but i watch way more via my roku box than i do on cable also if youre paying part of that 80 per month for your internet access  you still need that for the roku box and it needs to be fast internet source s roku user since version sd  now upgraded several times and wouldnt be without it coach t · 7 years ago9 0 1 comment roku monthly fee source shttpsshrinkima8gbg · 2 years ago0 0 comment a roku is a device that hooks up to your wireless system on your computer and your tv i got it to access netflix on my tv the only cost is the cost you pay to view netflix on your computer the device just transfers the movies to your tv and the cost of the roku you can access that information at wwwrokucom i like netflix the instant stuff is old but i have found that uk murder mysteries are the best ever doneold or not and there are a ton of movies ive never seen or i want to see again that are just excellent if you want newer movies then order a plan that allows you to get the dvds sent by mail the plans are all explained on wwwnetflixcom the roku also offers other channels such as amazonwhere you can pay for movies and a sports channela bunch of them that you do have to pay for their service and one free movie one that really has limited choices and very old movies it isnt slow or problematic and i like watching movies when i want them to start and when i feel like watching what i want it all depends on what you like to watch and how much you want to spend im tired of all the status stuff that says i have to have what the next guy haslike throw away your tv and get a flat screen now throw that away and get an almost hd and then throw that way and get a big screen hd and now get a cell phone to watch movies its just too much  ive decided to pick what i like and thats all im buying the rest im putting into my savings and vacation fund it doesnt take long to build up oh i didnt explainthe roku picks up its own channels and has nothing to do with cable if you want hbo then you have to order that through cable i have regular tvno cable and the roku and thats more than enough tv for me i can now get weather on my computer so that appeal is gone and for my final thoughtyou should know that i just finished watching the last sopranos dvd i could care less about not watching it a few years ago the ending still sucked i could have waited even longer for that   ohthe set up is simple once you have your wireless set up going its a couple of screens and you are ready to go i dont know where the 20 minute set up idea comes from the roku people are helpful and so are the folks at netflix more info i pay 15 for instant viewing and one dvd out at a time with the roku you just turn on the roku and your istant list of movies you want to see is available as is categories of other movies that you can just browse through there is a search engine so that you can look for other movie names or go through the search on your computer and set up your list its as easy as pressing a button a couple of times i also have found some excellent tv series i never watchedlike 24 and so many more that i have caught up onno commercials and when i want to see them towanda · 7 years ago2 0 comment how much is roku source shttpsshrinksima77n h · 1 year ago0 0 comment i tried roku  i still have it waste of money if you want anything good its going to cost extra its slow any of the free stuff is crap its still attached to my tv but i never use it i wrote to roku twice about this and they never wrote back netflix on roku slow not excellent quality and selection of movies limited to crap we cancelled streaming net flix setting up roku very difficult for each channel i wanted i had to go through roku first to get a website then go to the website and identify myself  and pay a fee sometimes  then copy a code from the website and punch it into roku which is not easy to use it takes about twenty minutes to set up one channel i recommend against roku eliot k · 7 years ago4 2 1 comment i have three television sets in my home i guess that means i would need three roku boxes if i want to
