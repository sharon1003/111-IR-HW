ive allocated to minecraft 495mbhow do you allocate more ram to minecraft i checked my other computer intel i5 core and it had the same amount of ram allocated to minecraft however minecraft did not lag on that computer after i installed optifine on this computer the lag stopped i dont know why cause i read that optifine splits the load onto 2 cores but i have only one core at least i think so a sticker on the laptop says intel core i7minecraftshare improve this questionedited dec 27 17 at 2130steven vascellaro8514 6 40 100asked jun 13 13 at 619meraj993293 11 40 801here is a good optimization guide note that simply allocating more ram may not always actually help mine craft can perform worse with too much ram allocated  for example it is recommended not to use more than 512mb for vanilla the amount needed depends on the mods and texture packs you are using – mellamokb jun 13 13 at 16061core i7 can have between 26 cores depending on the model so optifine should help allot also this may not apply to you but i had a laptop which was really laggy for minecraft and i realised i didnt have the best graphics drivers installed i was using the default chipset and not the nvidia drivers after installing the nvidia drivers it worked amazingly make sure you have the drivers for the correct graphics card should be a sticker on your laptop next to the i7 – really good pie jun 14 13 at 1115really good pie well thats strange cause i checked device manager and i have 8 cores – meraj99 jun 15 13 at 601i was just going off of wikipedia which states that it has up to 6 cores i thought i7 could have 8 cores but assumed i had it wrong – really good pie jun 15 13 at 6051really good pie an intel core i7 has between 26 physical cores which appear to the operating system as 412 logical cores through hyperthreading – philipp nov 11 13 at 1308add a comment8 answers active oldest votesup vote14down voteaccepted before you allocate ram there are some things you should knowx64 systems can allocate up to 192gb when using windows professional or above 16gb when using windows home premium and 8gb when using home premium and starter also please be aware of the physical limits imposed by your cpu architecturex32 systems can allocate up to 1gb this is from personal experience on a 8gb machine and a 3gb machine please correct me if im wrongso it is recommended you have a x64 system to allocate as much ram as possible try an leave at least 1gb for the general system processes and stuff like that here is how you allocate ram on a windows system create a new document and save it as runbat type the following this is for 4gb clocation to your javawjavawexe xmx4096m xms2048m jar location of your minecraft exeso basically the xmx is your maximum ram your allocating and your xms is the minimum ram it should use here is an example of an actual runbatcprogram filesjavabinjavawexe xmx4096 xms2048 jar cusersuserdesktopminecraftexeor if you have assigned java in your system variablesjavaw xmx4096 xms2048 jar cusersuserdesktopminecraftexeobviously dont just copy my code as you need to find out where a your javawexe is located and b where your minecraftexe remember 1gb  1024mb and 05gb  512mbnew launcher 16with the new launcher it is allot easier to allocate ram to your minecraft simply go ahead and edit a profile and where it says java settings advanced tick all the check boxes then add the amount of ram you would like to the jvm arguments text box for example if i wanted to run it with 1gb i would simply type xmx1g and the 1g will indicate 1gb of ram xmx indicates the maximum ram to allocate ensure that you have the correct path to your java and that you have jdk installed alternativelysimply download the tekkit pack and there is an option to play vanilla minecraft simply select the cog or settings icon in the top right corner and it will give you an option to allocate ram if other methods are failing good luck also if you are having trouble doing any of this just simply google it and there are literally 100s of posts similar to this and allot of tutorialsshare improve this answeredited dec 15 15 at 507robotnik ♦247k 36 119 208answered

machine minecraft is unusual because it tends to be cpubound rather than gpu and memorybound but it is possible your java heap is too small to determine whether your java heap is big enough open minecraft and launch any world show the debug screen press f3  in the top right corner look for a line that says mem x yz mb x and y will be constantly increasing z will generally not change much but see the next line the line below that will say allocated w z mb if this remains less than 100 after you play for a while that means java is not using its maximum heap size this is rather unusual but it may mean you are not under serious memory pressure ie you dont need a bigger heap or it may simply mean that java is not good at figuring out how big its heap should be this cannot happen if youre using the xms and xmx options described in other answers since they force the minimum and maximum heap sizes to be the same play for a while until the mem line has reached 100 and gone down a few times this is called garbage collection and indicates that the java runtime is reclaiming memory which the application minecraft is no longer using pay attention to how often this happens if its happening very frequently eg once a second or you see the percentage constantly oscillating near 100 you probably dont have enough memory on javas heap if it does not happen very often but you see lag when it does your collection runs are too slow adding more memory may help with this to a point since it allows for better generational garbage collection only collecting some of the dead memory some of the time however there are diminishing returns here and you may need a better cpu if you continue to observe this behavior after adjusting the heap in this case you might also experiment with xgc priopausetime but ymmv on whether that accomplishes anything whatsoever as a rule of thumb do not make the heap bigger than your actual physical ram you will just cause the application to begin swapping or pagingshare improve this answeredited dec 15 15 at 453answered dec 15 15 at 443kevin1217 1 8 23add a commentup vote0down vote create a bat file this is how mine looksjavaw xmx4096 xms2048

and on the launcher has changed and there is now a new arguably easier way to allocate more memory to minecraft you can do this by opening up the minecraft launcher clicking the edit profile button at
