inbetweeners movie received mostly positive reviews upon its original united kingdom release in august 2011 following release in the united states in september 2012 critical reaction was less favourable with the film at first holding a 75 score on rotten tomatoes and having since dropped to 54 with the sites consensus it arguably plays most strongly to fans of the british series but even viewers who have never seen the inbetweeners on tv may find themselves won over by the films surprisingly tender ribaldry 12 at the website metacritic which uses a normalized rating system the film received a mixed rating of 44100 based on 17 reviews 13 ian freer of empire gave the film four stars out of five observing that like any holiday it is episodic and suffers from repetition but this is gagforgag the funniest film of the summer and a fitting end to a muchloved series 14 steve rose of the guardian gave the film three stars out of five giving particular praise to simon birds performance and arguing that the film updates the teen summer holiday formula surprisingly entertainingly considering it doesnt subvert its one iota and the formula was already done previously with holiday on the buses and kevin  perry go large among others 15 tim robey of the daily telegraph also gave a positive assessment of the film praising it as an enormous hit a mamma mia for the hangover demographic 16 screen daily on the other hand gave a mixed review praising the performances of the main cast and proclaiming the film britain’s delayed riposte to american pie  yet simultaneously arguing that it cant quite shake off its tv roots and plotwise this is nothing the greek tourist board would want to advertise 17 australian critic margaret pomeranz from at the movies called the characters gormless and said im giving this one star really generously 18 she also said that the style of humour in the film was the reason that the british empire collapsed 19home media  editon 12
