from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search tesla autopilot may reduce accidents due to negligence and fatigue from long term driving 1tesla autopilot later marketed as enhanced autopilot after a second hardware version started to be shipped is an advanced driverassistance system feature offered by tesla that has lane centering adaptive cruise control selfparking ability to automatically change lanes without requiring driver steering and enables the car to be summoned to and from a garage or parking spot planned improvements to enhanced autopilot include transitioning from one freeway to another and exiting the freeway when your destination is near as an upgrade above and beyond enhanced autopilots capabilities the companys stated intent is to offer full selfdriving at a future time acknowledging that legal regulatory and technical hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal 2as of february 2018 tesla indicates that a demonstration of a self driving

model x upon its release 4 autopilot was included within a tech package option at that time autopilot features included semiautonomous drive and parking capabilities 5 6 7 initial versions of autopilot were developed in partnership with the israeli company mobileye 8 tesla and mobileye ended their partnership in july 2016 9 10in october 2015 tesla released autopilot version 70 to its customers 11 in december 2015 tesla announced that it will remove some selfdriving features to discourage customers from engaging in risky behavior autopilot firmware 71 made those changes and includes remote parking technology known as summon that can park and can bring the car to the driver without the driver in the car 12 13 14on august 31 2016 elon musk announced autopilot 80 that processes radar signals to create a coarse point cloud similar to lidar to help navigate in low visibility conditions and even to see in front of the car ahead 15 16 autopilot as of version 8 uses radar as the primary sensor instead of the camera 17 in november 2016 autopilot 80 was updated to have a more noticeable signal to the driver that it is engaged and it requires drivers to touch the steering wheel more frequently otherwise autopilot will turn off 18 19 by november 2016 autopilot had operated actively on hardware version 1 vehicles for 300 million miles 500 million km and 13 billion miles 2 billion km in shadow mode 20as of october 2016 tesla said all vehicles come with the necessary sensing and computing hardware known as hardware version 2 hw2 for future fully autonomous operation  sae level 5  with software being made available as it matures 21 the company offers various freeextracost options for enabling autopilotassociated featuresservices autopilot on hardware version 1 cars is available for us2500 3000 after delivery for hw2 cars autopilot is available as enhanced autopilot for 5000 6000 after delivery and future full selfdriving capability is an additional 3000 4000 after delivery 22the first release of autopilot for hw2 cars was in february 2017 it included adaptive cruise control autosteer that was enabled on divided highways autosteer on local roads’ up to a speed of 35 mph or a specified number of mph over the local speed limit 23 firmware version 81 for hw2 began in june 2017 that has many new features including a new autopilot drivingassist algorithm fullspeed braking and handling parallel and perpendicular parking 24on april 28 2017 elon musk predicted that in around two years drivers would be able to sleep in their tesla until it finishes the trip 25in the middle of 2017 tesla planned to demonstrate full selfdriving by the end of 2017 26 27 in february 2018 tesla indicates the demonstration of a self driving coast to coast drive will be ready in three to six months 3hardware  edithardware 1  editvehicles manufactured after late september 2014 are equipped with a camera mounted at the top of the windshield forward

editan updated hardware version referred to as hw 25 also known as 21 was released in july 2017 with cars built from august 2017 containing the updated hardware set in hw 25 there is a secondary node without a gpu to provide more computing power and wiring redundancy which is to slightly improve reliability 53 54driving features  edittesla requires operators to monitor the vehicle at all times just as the federal aviation administration requires pilots to monitor aircraft on autopilot autopilot includes multiple capabilities including adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning software updates  editautopilotenabled cars receive autopilot software updates wirelessly the same as all other tesla software updates adaptive cruise control  editautopilot has the ability to follow another car maintaining a safe distance from it as it speeds up and slows down it can observe a second vehicle in front of the vehicle that it is following it also slows on tight curves and when a car crosses the road in front of it it can be enabled at any speed above 17 mph by default it sets the limit at the current speed limit plusminus any driverspecified offset alerts  editautopilot alerts the driver under various circumstances such as a surprising situation on the road or excessive inattention by the driver if the driver dismisses three audio warnings within an hour autopilot is disabled until the car is parked this is to prevent experienced drivers from excessive reliance on builtin safety features at speeds under 8 mph on divided highways autopilot functions indefinitely without the drivers hands on the wheel under 45 mph free hands are allowed for five minutes unless the car detects lateral acceleration above 45 mph free hands are allowed for three minutes if following another vehicle or one minute without following a car 36autoparksummon  editautopark drives the car into a parking spot while summon drives it out configuration settings control maximum distance side clearance and bumper clearance this feature activates homelink to open and close garage doors and it is available using the fob or the tesla mobile app 55 as of march 2017 summon was available in beta for hw2 controls include bumper side clearance and summon distance 56autosteer  editautosteer steers the car to remain in whatever lane it is in known as lanekeeping with hw1 it is also able to safely change lanes as directed by a tap of the turn signal 57 as of may 2017 hw2 is limited to 90 mph 145 kmh on highway roads and the former 35 mph 56 kmh speed limit on nonhighway roads was removed instead limiting to five over the speed limit or 45 mph 72 kmh if no speed limit is detected 58safety features  editthe autopilot can detect a potential front or side collision with another vehicle bicycle or pedestrian within a distance of 525 feet 160 m if one is found it sounds a warning 59 autopilot has automatic emergency braking that detects objects that may hit the car and applies the brakes autopilot also can automatically adjust the highlow beam headlights as the nighttime lighting changes speed assist  editfrontfacing cameras detect speed limit signs and display the current limit on the dashboard or center display limits are compared against gps data if no signs are present 59public debate  editsome industry experts have raised questions about the legal status of autonomous driving in the u s and whether tesla owners would violate current state regulations when using the autopilot function the few states that have passed laws allowing autonomous cars on the road limit their use for testing purposes not for use by the general public also there are questions about the liability for autonomous cars in case there is a mistake 60 a tesla spokesman said there is nothing in our autopilot system that is in conflict with current regulations we are not getting rid of the pilot this is about releasing the driver from tedious tasks so they can focus and provide better input google s director of selfdriving cars said he does not think there is a regulatory block as long as the selfdriving vehicle met crashtest and other safety standards a spokesman for the u s national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa said that any autonomous vehicle would need to meet applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and the nhtsa will have the appropriate policies and regulations in place to ensure the safety of this type of vehicles 60according to elon musk we really designed the model s to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company a huge part of what tesla is is a silicon valley software company we view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop 61 full autonomy is “really a software limitation the hardware exists to create full autonomy so it’s really about developing advanced narrow ai for the car to operate on“ 62 63the autopilot development focus is on increasingly sophisticated neural nets that can operate in reasonably sized computers in the car” 62 63 according to musk the car will learn over time  including from other cars 64 early data after 47 million miles of driving in autopilot mode shows the probability of an accident is at least 50 lower when using autopilot 65 however ars technica notes that the brake system tends to initiate later than some drivers expect 66 one driver claimed that teslas autopilot failed to brake resulting in collisions tesla pointed out that the driver deactivated the cruise control of the car prior to the crash 67 ars technica also notes that the lane changes are semiautomatic the driver must activate the turn signal in order for the car to initiate a lane change 68teslas autopilot with hardware version 1 hw1 can be classified as somewhere between levels 2 and 3 under the u s department of transportation ’s national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa five levels of vehicle automation at this level the car can act autonomously but requires the driver to be prepared to take control at a moments notice 69 70 hw1 is suitable only on limitedaccess highways and sometimes will fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself in urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs this system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists 71 and while ap1 detects motorcycles 72 there has been two instances of ap rearending motorcycles 73there has been significant controversy over the media response to the fatal tesla accident described in the below section whilst a significant amount of blame was apportioned to tesla for the failure of its autopilot system it must be noted that the system at the time of the accident was in a beta phase and not ready for widespread public use and also required the driver to ensure that their hands remained on the steering wheel at all times and to be prepared to resume manual driving at any moment 74  undue weight – discuss hence when used as an assistive feature as intended by tesla some hold the view that autopilot can only enhance road safety 74 assuming it does not lull the driver into complacent inattention autopilot potentially saved the life of a pedestrian in washington d c on the night of july 17 2016 75 76 and played a pivotal role in a medical emergency involving 37yearold joshua neally that same month 77 neally was driving his tesla model x when he suffered a pulmonary embolism that caused intense panic and rendered him incapable of driving 78 neally used autopilot to drive most of the highway to a local hospital at the offramp neally took control of the car and drove to the emergency room 78legal challenges  editteslas autopilot is facing a class action suit that claims the secondgeneration enhanced autopilot system is dangerously defective 79serious crashes  edithandan china january 20 2016  editon january 20 2016 the driver of a tesla model s in handan china was killed when their car crashed into a stationary truck 80 the tesla was following a car in the far left lane of a multilane highway the car in front moved to the right lane to avoid a truck stopped on the left shoulder and the tesla which the drivers father believes was in autopilot mode did not slow before colliding with the stopped truck 81 according to footage captured by a dashboard camera the stationary street sweeper on the left side of the expressway partially extended into the far left lane and the driver did not appear to respond to the unexpected obstacle 82in september 2016 the media reported the drivers family had filed a lawsuit in july against the tesla dealer who sold the car 83 the familys lawyer stated the suit was intended to let the public know that selfdriving technology has some defects we are hoping tesla when marketing its products will be more cautious don’t just use selfdriving as a selling point for young people 81 tesla released a statement which said they have no way of knowing whether or not autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash since the car telemetry could not be retrieved remotely due to damage caused by the crash 81 telemetry was recorded locally to a sd card and given to tesla who decoded it and provided that data to a third party for independent review tesla added that while the thirdparty appraisal is not yet complete we have no reason to believe that autopilot on this vehicle ever functioned other than as designed 84williston florida may 7 2016  editthe first known fatal accident involving a tesla engaged in autopilot mode took place in williston florida on may 7 2016 the driver was killed in a crash with a 18wheel tractortrailer by late june 2016 the u s national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the florida highway patrol according to the nhtsa preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractortrailer made a left turn in front of the tesla at an intersection on a noncontrolled access highway and the car failed to apply the brakes the car continued to travel after passing under the truck’s trailer 85 86 87 the nhtsas preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash which involves a population of an estimated 25000 model s cars 88 on july 8 2016 the nhtsa requested tesla inc to hand over to the agency detailed information about the design operation and testing of its autopilot technology the agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to autopilot since its introduction and teslas planned updates scheduled for the next four months 89according to tesla neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractortrailer against a brightly lit sky so the brake was not applied the car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the model s tesla also stated that this was tesla’s first known autopilotrelated death in over 130 million miles 208 million km driven by its customers while autopilot was activated according to tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles 150 million km among all type of vehicles in the u s 85 86 90 it is estimated that billions of miles will need to be traveled before tesla autopilot can claim to be safer than humans with statistical significance although fewer than billions of miles will be needed if tesla autopilot is more dangerous researchers say that tesla and others need to release more data on the limitations and performance of automated driving systems if selfdriving cars are to become safe and understood enough for mass market use 91 92the trucks driver told the associated press that he could hear a harry potter movie playing in the crashed car and said the car was driving so quickly that he went so fast through my trailer i didnt see him it was still playing when he died and snapped a telephone pole a quarter mile down the road according to the florida highway patrol they found in the wreckage an aftermarket portable dvd player it is not possible to watch videos on the model s touchscreen display 87 93dr deb bruce head of the investigation team announces results to the board on september 12 2017in july 2016 the u s national transportation safety board ntsb announced it had opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while autopilot was engaged the ntsb is an investigative body that only has the power to make policy recommendations an agency spokesman said its worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible the ntsb opens annually about 25 to 30 highway investigations 94in january 2017 the ntsb released its report 95 that says tesla was not at fault since the driver in the crash had seven seconds to see the truck and it found no defects in the autopilot system the investigation concluded that the tesla car crash rate dropped by 40 percent after autopilot was installed 96 97 the nhtsa published its report in january 2018 98culver city california january 22 2018  editon january 22 2018 a tesla model s crashed into a fire truck parked on the side of the i405 freeway in culver city california while traveling at a speed exceeding 50 mph 80 kmh and the driver survived 99 the driver said he was using autopilot according to the culver city fire department which reported the crash over twitter at approximately 830 a m the fire truck and a california highway patrol vehicle were parked in the left emergency lane and carpool lane of the southbound 405 blocking off the scene of an earlier accident with emergency lights flashing 100autopilot may not detect stationary vehicles at highway speeds and it cannot detect some objects 101 other advanced driverassistance systems have similar limitations raj rajkumar who studies autonomous driving systems at carnegie mellon university believes the radars used for autopilot are designed to detect moving objects but are not very good in detecting stationary objects 102 both ntsb and nhtsa have dispatched teams to investigate the crash 103 hod lipson director of columbia university s creative machines lab faulted the diffusion of responsibility concept if you give the same responsibility to two people they each will feel safe to drop the ball nobody has to be 100 and thats a dangerous thing 104mountain view california march 23 2018  editon march 23 2018 a second us autopilot fatality occurred in mountain view california 105 the crash occurred just before 930 a m on southbound us 101 at the carpool lane exit for southbound highway 85 at a concrete barrier where the lefthand offramp separates from 101 after the model x crashed into the narrow concrete barrier it was struck again by two following vehicles and then it caught on fire 106both the nhtsa and ntsb are investigating the march 2018 crash 107 another driver of a model s demonstrated that autopilot appeared to be confused by the road stripes in april 2018 the gore ahead of the barrier is marked by diverging solid white lines a veeshape the autosteer feature of the model s appeared to mistakenly use the leftside white line instead of the rightside white line as the lane marking for the far left lane which would have led the model s into the same concrete barrier had the driver not taken control 108 ars technica concluded that as autopilot gets better drivers could become increasingly complacent and pay less and less attention to the road 109in a corporate blog post tesla noted the impact attenuator separating the offramp from us 101 had been previously crushed and not replaced prior to the model x crash on march 23 105 110 the post also stated that autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash and the drivers hands had not been detected manipulating the steering wheel for six seconds before the crash vehicle data showed the driver had five seconds and 150 metres 490 ft unobstructed view of the concrete divider  but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken 105 the ntsb investigation had been focused on the damaged impact attenuator and the vehicle fire after the collision but after it was reported the driver had complained about the autopilot functionality 111 the ntsb announced it would also investigate all aspects of this crash including the driver’s previous concerns about the autopilot 112 a ntsb spokesman stated the organization is unhappy with the release of investigative information by tesla 113 elon musk dismissed the criticism tweeting that ntsb was an advisory body and that tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately  always will to do otherwise would be unsafe 114see also  editnissan propilot references  edit epstein zach 20160721 tesla autopilot crash avoidance model s
