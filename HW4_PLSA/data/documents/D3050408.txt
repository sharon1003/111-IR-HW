military uniforms from 1690 to 1865 by rené lhôpital a distinction should be made between uniforms and ethnic dress if a particular people or culture favoured a distinctive dress style this could easily create the impression of uniformly dressed warriors the issue is further complicated by the distinctive features weapons armour fighting style and native dress of particularly effective warrior classes often being copied thus the distinctive and colourful clothing of the hungarian hussars became a model for hussar units all over europe the kilts and sporrans of scottish highland clans were distilled into regimental dress when the british army started to recruit from these tribal groups mercenary or irregular fighters could also develop their own fashions which set them apart from civilians but were not really uniforms the clothing of the german landsknechte of the 16th century is an example of distinctive military fashion special units such as zouaves developed nonstandard uniforms to distinguish them from troops of the line antiquity  editthere are a few recorded attempts at uniform dress in antiquity going beyond the similarity to be expected of ethnic or tribal dress one example is the spanish infantry of hannibal who wore white tunics with crimson edgings another is the spartan hoplite in his red garment the terracotta army discovered in the tomb of the first emperor of china c 200 bc have a superficial similarity but closer examination shows up to seven different styles of armour which do not appear to have been standardised within separate units rome  editmain article roman military uniform roman centurion  historical reenactment  the legions of the roman republic and empire had a fairly standardised dress and armour particularly from approximately the early to mid 1st century onward when lorica segmentata segmented armour was introduced 1 however the lack of unified production for the roman army meant that there were still considerable differences in detail even the armour produced in state factories varied according to the province of origin 2 shields were painted in unique patterns to indicate which cohort a soldier was from fragments of surviving clothing and wall paintings indicate that the basic tunic of the roman soldier was of undyed offwhite or reddyed wool 3 senior commanders are known to have worn white cloaks and plumes centurions — the century commanders who made up the long serving backbone of the legions — were distinguished by transverse crests on their helmets various chest ornaments phaleræ corresponding to modern medals and torques a symbol borrowed from the gauls and also used as a military award and the vine stick vitis that they carried as a mark of their office late roman and byzantine  editwhile some auxiliary cohorts in the late roman period had carried shields with distinctive colours or designs there is no evidence that any one roman legion was distinguished from another by features other than the numbers on the leather covers protecting their shields the regular thematic provincial and tagmata central troops of the byzantine empire east roman are the first known soldiers to have had what would now be considered regimental or unit identification during the 10th century each of the cavalry banda making up these forces is recorded as having plumes and other distinctions in a distinctive colour officers wore a waist sash or pekotarion which may have been of different colours according to rank 4medieval feudal  editthe feudal system of western europe provided instances of distinguishing features denoting allegiance to one or another lord these however seldom went beyond colours and patterns painted on shields or embroidered on surcoats orders of military monks such as the knights templar or hospitaler wore mantles respectively of white with red crosses on the shoulder or black with white crosses over the usual pattern of armour for their periods in the later part of the medieval period instances of standardised clothing being issued for particular campaigns began to occur english examples included the white coats worn by norfolk levies recruited in 1296 and the green and white clothing that identified cheshire archers during the 14th century 5ottoman empire  editthe highly organised armies of the ottoman empire employed distinctive features of dress to distinguish one corps or class of soldier from another an example would be the conical black hats of felt worn by the deli cavalry of the early 19th century however the basic costume was usually that of the tribal group or social class from which a particular class of warrior was drawn as such it was sufficiently varied not to rank as uniform in the later sense an elaborate system of colourful standards largely provided unit identification even the appearance of the janissaries was likely to reflect individual means and taste although red was a favoured colour and the white felt zarcola headdresses were similar it was not until the reorganisation of the ottoman army by sultan mahmud ii during the 1820s that completely standardised dress was issued navies  editseamans jumper hand knitted wool in an early instance of camouflage awareness the sailors of imperial rome are reported to have worn bluegrey tunics 6 however uniform dress was not a feature of navies officers and marines excepted until comparatively recent times this may reflect the considerable difference in roles and conditions of service between sailors and soldiers until the middle of the 19th century only officers and warrant officers in the royal navy wore regulated uniforms through the 18th century to the napoleonic wars navy officers had a form of dress broadly resembling that of army officers though in dark blue with white facings in the early 19th century royal navy officers developed a more distinctive form of uniform comprising in full dress a cocked hat dark blue coatee with white collar and cuffs dark blue or white trousers or breeches 7 epaulettes and braiding were gold and varied according to rank in a simplified form this dress without the cocked hat survives as the modern ceremonial dress for flag officers throughout this period sailors supplied or made their own clothing sailors developed traditional clothing suitable for their work loosefitting trousers with belts made of rope tunics that slipped over the head with arms to above the wrist so that the cloth would not foul in ropes passing through a cleat or pulley for cold weather a jumper was knitted from yarn or wool for wet weather old sail cloth was made into a coat with hat or attached hood that was waterproofed with tallow or fat in these days the officers would designate certain afternoons to  make and mend  clothing a sailor with little clothing to make or mend used this time as time off in january 1857 the decision was taken to issue complete uniforms to petty officers and seamen 8 this included features which can still be recognised in the class i uniform of ratings in the modern royal navy  notably the wide blue collar with white tapes a black neckerchief white lanyard and blue or white jumper the flared bell bottom trousers disappeared after the second world war because of the global dominance of the royal navy from trafalgar to the second world war rn uniforms became the model for virtually all other navies while certain distinctive features emerged  such as the red pompom worn on the crown of the french sailors cap the open fronted jacket of the german navy or the white round cap of the u s navy  the overall pattern remained standard until the development of specialist working or protective rigs during the second world war regimental dress  editfacing colours were introduced to distinguish the various regiments here the régiment du lyonnais with red and green facings on the standard grey uniform 17201734the styles and decoration of military uniforms varied immensely with the status image and resources of the military throughout the ages uniform dress became the norm with the adoption of regimental systems initially by the french army in the mid17th century before 1600 a few german and dutch regiments had worn red or yellow coats from about 1626 onwards some swedish infantry had been issued with standard coloured dress under gustavus adolphus hence his yellow or blue regiments 9 however in the main the levies of the 15th and 16th centuries wore civilian dress and regiments were dressed at the expense of their colonels in whatever style and colours the colonel preferred even royal guards would sometimes only be issued with distinctive coloured or embroidered surcoats to wear over ordinary clothing to help armies distinguish friend from foe scarves pieces of foliage or other makeshift identification known as field signs would be worn 10 a practice still recognised under international humanitarian law and the laws of war as a distinctive sign 11 field signs were easily removed or donned 10 as in the example of john smith a squire on the royalist side who at the battle of edgehill put on the orange scarf of the parliamentarians and with no more elaborate disguise succeeded in recapturing the lost royal standard from the hands of earl of essexs own secretary 12by this time in france at least the general character of the clothes and accoutrements to be worn on various occasions was strictly regulated by orders but uniformity of clothing was not to be expected so long as the enlistment system prevailed and soldiers were taken in and dismissed at the beginning and end of every campaign the beginnings of uniform are therefore to be found in truly national armies in the indelta of gustavus adolphus and the english armies of the english civil war in the earlier years of the latter though the richer colonels uniformed their men as for instance the marquess of newcastles whitecoats and king charless own redcoated lifeguard of foot the rustics and the citizens turned out for war in their ordinary rough clothes donning armour and swordbelt but in 1645 the long parliament raised an army all its own for permanent service and the colonels became officials rather than proprietors the new model army was clothed in the civilian costume of the date—ample coat waistcoat breeches stockings and shoes in the case of cavalry boots—but with the distinctive colour throughout the army of red and with regimental facings of various colours and breeches of grey soon afterwards the helmet disappeared and its place was taken by a grey broadbrimmed hat from the coat was eventually evolved the tunic of the mid19th century and the hat became the cocked hat of a later generation which generally disappeared during the decade of 18001810 to reappear in the late 19th and early 20th century by which time it had its original form of a slouchhat for service in ireland the new model armys red coat was exchanged for one of russet colour just as scarlet gave way to khaki for indian service in the 19th century the cavalry iron sides however wore buff leather coats and armour long after the infantry had abandoned them 12franz rudolf frisching in the uniform of an officer of the bernese huntsmen corps with his berner laufhund painted by jean preudhomme in 1785thus the principle ever since followed—uniform coat and variegated facings—was established little or nothing of sentiment led to this by choice or convenience the majority of the corps out of which the new model army was formed had come to be dressed in red with facings according to the colonels taste and it is a curious fact that in austria sixty years afterwards events took the same course the colonels there uniformed their men as they saw fit had by tacit consent probably to obtain wholesale  prices agreed upon a serviceable colour pearl grey and when in 1707 prince eugene procured the issue of uniform regulations few line regiments had to be reclothed in france as in england and austria the cavalry as yet rather led by the wealthy classes than officered by the professional was not uniformed upon an army system until after the infantry but in 1688 sixsevenths of the french cavalry was uniformed in light grey with red facings and about half the dragoon regiments had red uniforms and blue facings the marquis of louvois in creating a standing army had introduced an infantry uniform as a necessary consequence the native french regiments had light grey coats the swiss red the german black and the italian blue with various facings the french grey was probably decided upon like the austrian grey as being a good service colour which could be cheaply manufactured 12military uniforms of the american revolution during the 18th century the normal military uniform in europe comprised a standardised form of civilian dress  tricorn hat longskirted coat waistcoat and breeches  13 one distinctively military feature were the long canvas gaiters which came up to midthigh and had multiple buttons dress was surprisingly standardised between european armies in cut and general outline the distinction normally lay in colours red coats for the british and danes light grey then white for the french spanish and austrian 14 infantry dark blue for the prussians and portuguese green for the russians etc 15 within each army different regiments were usually distinguished by  facings   linings turnbacks and braiding on coats in colours that were distinctive to one or several regiments the royal comtois infantry regiment of the french army for example had large dark blue cuffs on its offwhite coats to a certain extent the functions required of a given group of soldiers were reflected in their dress thus artillery uniforms in most armies were usually of dark blue  for the practical reason that handling black powder would have soiled lighter coloured clothing 16 infantry drummers and cavalry trumpeters often had reverse colours with coats the colour of the regimental facings and facings the colour of the regimental coats officers who paid for their own clothing were relatively slow to accept uniforms during the late 17th century they were often dressed in individual styles and colours according to their own taste and means in part this was because the uniform dress issued to the rank and file was considered a form of livery  the mark of a servant and demeaning to members of the social class from which officers came one early practice in the french and other armies was for officers to wear coats of the facing colour of their regiments rank insignia as such was unknown until well into the 18th century the gorget hanging from a chain around the neck and a last survival of medieval armour was the only universally recognised mark of an officer until epaulettes developed from clusters of ribbons formerly worn on the shoulder 17 in the british army officers were ordered to adopt epaulettes by a clothing warrant dated 1768 even when officers uniforms became the subject of detailed regulation they remained easily distinguishable from those of other ranks by the better quality and richness of the materials and trimmings used gold or silver braiding on the hats and coats of officers usually matched the bronze or pewter of the numerous buttons on regimental clothing 18new uniforms were issued with surprising frequency in some 18thcentury armies once a year in the british service it should however be remembered that a soldier had to march parade fight and sometimes sleep in the same garment and that such extras as greatcoats or working clothes were seldom issued until the end of the century19th century  edithorse artillery uniform of the french imperial guard the first fifteen years of this century influenced the appearance of military uniforms until the 1850s in particular some french uniforms  notably those of the cavalry regiments of the imperial guard  are considered as being amongst the most striking and distinctive of the time 19 the cost of the french uniforms varied widely going from 200250 francs for a line infantrymans outfit to 2000 francs for a cuirassiers uniform 19 cavalrymen of the guard had no fewer than 10 different uniforms 19 one justification for the expensive parade dresses of the guard was that they would lead the people of the conquered nations to regard the french uniforms with unreserved astonishment 19 as a general trend france and other european states replaced their bicornes by feathered shakos or crested helmets the ornamental peak of the military uniform was reached in the early 19th century in western europe sometimes the napoleonic wars are identified as being the acme of colourful and ornate uniforms but actually the several decades of relative peace that followed were a time of even more decorative styles and embellishments the napoleonic soldier on campaign was likely to present a shabby and nondescript appearance as unsuitable peacetime dress quickly deteriorated or was replaced with whatever local substitutes were available until later on in the century dyes were primitive and different batches of uniforms worn by the same unit might present differing shades especially after exposure to rain and sun the white uniforms popular amongst many armies through the 18th and early 19th centuries soiled easily and had to be pipeclayed to retain any semblance of cleanliness green as worn by jäger and rifle regiments proved particularly prone to fading until suitable chemical dyes were devised in the 1890s british soldiers were known for their striking red clothing hence the name  redcoats  this was actually a fairly dull shade of madder red until the general adoption of scarlet for tunics in the 1870s the american industrial revolution began in the blackstone valley of massachusetts and rhode island with early textiles from 1791 among the earliest manufacturers of us military uniforms was the capron mills at uxbridge massachusetts from 1820 the american civil war  editmain articles uniform of the union army and uniforms of the confederate states military forces colour plate from the war of the rebellion atlas depicting union and confederate uniforms it is generally supposed that union soldiers wore blue uniforms and confederate soldiers wore grey ones however this was only a generalisation both the union and the confederacy drew up uniform regulations but as a matter of practical reality neither side was able to fully equip its men at the outbreak of the war existing state units and quickly raised volunteer regiments on both sides wore a wide variety of styles and colours in the early stages of the war some regiments—such as the norths berdan sharpshooters and the souths alexandria rifles—had green uniforms while the french zouave style was widely imitated the union eventually got most of its men into regulation federal blue but this often faded until it appeared grey originally the confederate government relied on the commutation system which required the states to provide their own uniforms while the commutation system was in place many states were not able to provide an ample supply of uniforms and captured federal uniforms were common later in the war the confederate national government provided uniforms from a central depot system including the famous richmond and columbus depots many photographs of confederate soldiers from later in the war usually casualties are wearing standardised uniforms as shermans men marched across georgia and up the carolinas they were cut off from supply by the union and began wearing clothing of confederate origin confederate soldiers used a variety of vegetable and imported dyes which would fade to a butternut colour the end of bright colours  editcoldstream guards on parade in ceremonial uniform painting by william barnes wollen 18571936until 1914 the majority of armies still provided colourful dress uniforms for all ranks 20 21 at least for parade and off duty wear these often retained distinctive features from the past most russian troops for example wore the very dark green introduced by peter the great in 1700 german infantry generally wore the dark  prussian blue  of the previous two centuries this and other features of the historic prussian army uniform were generally adopted by the other german states as they fell under prussian influence before and after the francoprussian war of 1870 bavarians however continued to wear light blue and saxon regiments retained a number of distinctions after the establishment of the german empire 1871 22 two regiments of the prussian guard and one of the russian were still issued with the brass mitre caps of the 18thcentury grenadier the british infantry retained their scarlet tunics for parade and walking out wear while the bulk of french regiments wore red trousers with dark or light blue tunics the infantry of the austrohungarian empire discarded their historic white tunics in 1868 in favour of dark blue retained however were the extremely large number of colours appearing on collars cuffs and shoulder straps to distinguish the various regiments there were for example ten shades of red ranging from cherry red to pink the swedish army had favoured dark blue with yellow facings since the beginning of the 18th century there was infinite variety even within smaller armies between regiments branches or ranks and the subject is a very complex one test uniforms created in 1912 by edouard detaille for the french infantry in order to lessen the visibility of the troops on the battlefield as can be seen on the campaign dresses right however by 1914 drab colours were increasingly being adopted for active service and ordinary duty wear the british first introduced drabkhaki uniform in 1848 in india 23 and this khaki drill became more generally worn from the indian mutiny of 1857 both in india and africa a darker version known as service drab was adopted for home service field wear in 1902 24 21 the same year that the us army also adopted khaki for nondress occasions the italians introduced greygreen in 1909 followed by the german and austrian armies who adopted different shades of grey the russians had changed to a grey shade of khaki in 1908 following their experience in the russo japanese war of 1905 there was however strong attachment to the colourful uniforms as previously worn on all occasions and the process was not an inexorable one the danish army adopted greygreen uniforms for all occasions in 1903 reverted to a combination of dark and light blue in 1910 took up light grey in 1915 and finally settled for khaki in 1923 25 the imperial russian armies following their adoption of khakigrey field uniforms in 1908 took the opportunity to upgrade their parade uniforms to much more elaborate and colorful styles and were experimenting with a mix of khaki and bright colours when war broke out in 1914 26 the japanese army probably went further than most in adopting khaki for all occasions after 1905 although even here officers of all branches and the cavalry of the imperial guard retained traditional coloured uniforms for formal and ceremonial occasions 27with the exception of western influenced units such as the evertriumphant army of the taiping rebellion 1851–66 chinese armies of the 19th century wore dress that was broadly variegated embroidered chest panels and coloured buttons on headdresses were used to distinguish rank and sometimes unit from 1910 the imperial chinese army adopted dark blue uniforms of japanese style with coloured facings of red white or yellow to distinguish the different branches the imperial guard division had a light grey uniform with the same branch colours as the line a khaki summer uniform was worn by the entire army 28the first world war finally put an end to the expensive practice of furnishing colourful uniforms to all ranks of the various armies amongst the frontline troops of the combatant powers in august 1914 only the belgian and french 29 armies saw active service in bright colours and old fashioned headgear although the austrohungarian cavalry retained their blue and red uniforms for field wear after the remainder of the army had gone into pike grey in 1909 30 the imperial german field grey of 1910 retained a number of traditional features such as spiked helmets shakos busbies and coloured piping from the older uniforms the demands of modern warfare as well as financial economy soon saw these survivals vanish and by 1916 all involved armies were in either khaki  russia turkish serbia montenegro japan greek french colonial and britain various shades of grey  german italian bulgarian portuguese and austrohungarian or sky blue french and romanian the coloured uniforms of peacetime were often relegated to depot wear by recruits doing their basic training steel helmets first appeared in the form of the adrian helmet adopted by the french army in 1915 the practical advantages of this innovation led the british and german armies to adopt their own helmets by 1916 other armies followed suit  the belgians and italians for example copying the french model and the austrohungarians that of germany between the wars  editthe drab uniforms of 191418 remained in general use until the second world war this was partly for political reasons since the republican fascist nazi and communist regimes that replaced many of the old monarchies and empires had little interest in preserving the splendours of their predecessors however even in those societies where there was social and political continuity the trend was away from the traditional uniforms worn prior to 1914 the british army reintroduced full dress for guards regiments in 191920 and regimental bands by 1928 while permitting officers to wear their mess evening blue or green patrols semiformal and full dress on appropriate occasions the french reintroduced grande tenue in 1927 for north african regiments which were mostly dependent on voluntary recruiting and after 1930 required all regular officers to acquire dress uniforms in the pre1914 colours of their branch or regiment elsewhere full or coloured dress of traditional cut was generally restricted to formal uniforms for officers and long service regulars ceremonial guards and a few other limited categories the spanish army which had not been involved in the first world war exceptionally continued to issue coloured uniforms to all its conscript rank and file until 1926 and thereafter to the garrisons of seville barcelona and madrid for special ceremonials until 1931 31 these included red trousers for the line infantry following the french practice in an example of crossborder influence the use of steel helmets was by now almost universal and a number of countries adopted their own designs moving away from the german british and french models of the first world war the italians soviets japanese swiss spanish and portuguese were amongst these steel helmets originally simply items of utilitarian protective clothing were adopted as parade headdress by the french german italian and soviet armies amongst others between the wars this publication containing various images and description of red army uniforms and insignia was printed by the british imperial war office during the second world war and was distributed to british officers note the message that tells the recipient the manual must not fall into enemy hands second world war  edituniforms of varying shades of khaki and grey were universal in the second world war but the cut and outline appearance of the different armies still made identification in the field relatively straight forward a soviet soldier would for example be distinguishable from his german opponent by his general outline even in the fog of battle british american japanese and french uniforms still retained some distinctive features even as they became more and more utilitarian in the course of the war the us army discarded its first world war style field uniforms in 1941 in favour of a very plain and practical combat dress in a thin light brown wool shirt sometimes with an olive green cast and slightly darker trousers this was worn in conjunction with a smart olive drab class a dress uniform—which in many cases varied to a rich chocolate brown tunic worn with khaki trousers there was a khaki version of the class a dress uniform for summer wear see united states army uniform in world war ii  the war started with american combat troops wearing combat shoes with spats a form of gaiters replaced later in the war with 2buckle combat boots by contrast british soldiers other than officers had their 1938 battledress for all occasions in germany the nazi regime retained uniforms with many traditional features from imperial germany for its army uniforms such as field grey cloth marching boots a taller version for officers collar litzen braiding and breeches for officers and ncos german panzer tank troops had a special combat uniform made of black wool and german troops serving in tropical climates had uniforms in a shade of khaki later in the war severe leather shortages led to the replacement of marching boots with ankle height shoes worn with gaiters gemäsch imperial japan used a light brown or khaki colour for most imperial army uniforms—though there was also a green service dress tunic for officers footwear was reddish brown jack boots restricted for wear only by officers while soldiers wore shoes with leg wrappings puttees  from 1935 to 1943 soviet army uniforms for all troops except than tank troops were an intermediate shade of brown uniforms included a field uniform  gymnasterka  shirt with collar tabs and a 2button breast opening belt breeches garrison cap and boots a service dress kittel tunic worn with breeches or trousers and a dress uniform mundir tunic worn with deep blue breeches soviet tank troops wore the gymnastyrka shirt kittel dress tunic in a bluish grey rather than brown colour in 1943 the soviet army began to readopt many tsarist army features notably braided shoulder boards which had previously been forbidden since the founding of the soviet army as a sign of an undesirable social class mentality the reintroduction in 1943 was presumably a relatively inexpensive means of boosting low soviet troop morale it worked once reintroduced to the soviet army the use of shoulder boards was never rescinded and they remained part of the uniform until the dissolution of the soviet union the distinct bluish grey colour for tankers was eliminated in 1943 from which point on all units of the soviet army wore brown modern uniforms  edita slovak army soldier in a camouflage uniform stands guard in front of the multinational divisioncentral south headquarters at

these united states army soldiers are designed to blend in with the environment new army combat uniform acu with universal digital pattern worn united states army soldier in afghanistan us marines wearing digital marpat camouflage uniforms in recent decades many militaries around the world have gradually simplified the range of uniforms issued for example most u s servicemen now wear camouflage utilities for daily duty and all but the most formal occasionswhereas in the past the service uniform would be worn unless a soldier was engaged in a dirty or physical task as an example of modern practice the us marine corps has a distinct blue dress uniform but other uniforms include khaki buttonup shirts forestgreen coats and combat camouflage in other services where camouflage is normally a nonissue such as navies coloured uniforms are still issued eg the us navy s white officer uniform for warm weather the united states armed forces allows every branch to develop and use their own uniforms in recent years many battle dress uniforms with famous us woodland pattern were replaced usmc developed new digital marpat pattern while the army developed universal pattern acu for its standard combat uniforms though a special camouflage pattern multicam more appropriate for use in afghanistan was fielded in 2010 popular disdain among us troops for the beret headgear as part of the default headgear for wear with the acu uniform led to a regulation revision in 2011 with the standard default headgear for wear with acus now being the acu patrol cap which provides a much better degree of sun protection for the eyes the u s army has since developed the ocp uniform starting in 2016 going back to a green camo pattern with coyote brown undershirts boots and belt the u s army is still in transition between the old acu pattern and the new ocp pattern the u s military uses different camo patterns when deployed in different combat zones in theater u s army mostly uses the multicam pattern in iraq and afghanistan but is subject to change due to the new ocp uniform being issued based on recommendations made during a comprehensive briefing by task force uniform on feb 24

introduced in 2007 and became obligatory for all ranks by 2011 the air force makes use of its airman battle uniform abu as a common daily uniform the breakdown is of sage green foliage green sand tan

security forces special operations weather team sere instructor pararescue and combat controller the purpose of the colors and patterns in this uniform serve to help one blend into the concretelike color of the flight line on which the uniform is most often worn outside aside from abus the most common uniform to be worn would be dress blues which incorporate a light navy blue for bottoms and the same shade to match the top jacket underneath the top jacket either a long sleeve or short sleeve sky blue shirt may be worn with a tie or neck tab whenever wearing the top jacket the jacket is reserved for more formal events placed on the outermost tunic airmen may pin their ribbons and career badge as optional with their name plate as the only mandatory item for head gear a flight cap of matching shade to the pants and similar in appearance to the former army green garrison cap and the shoes are a black high polished dress shoe other but not standard head gear includes the flat top mess dress cap and the appropriate beret career field beret blues though the second most used uniform receive far less service than abus those performing duties not suited for the formal dress uniform may wear abus instead the mess uniform uses the same pants and jacket as dress blues but with a white undershirt bow tie and cumberband and the same black dress shoes afi 362903 purpose  editdistinctive clothing  editfurther information facing colour one purpose of military uniforms is to clearly distinguish combatants who are protected by the laws of war from other persons carrying weapons who do not always enjoy such protection another purpose in historical times was to make it difficult for deserters to avoid detection military uniforms were so distinctive with many metal buttons and unique colours that they could not be modified into unrecognisable clothing in societies where the military was important the soldiers were dressed to impress the population and themselves if the commander raised and equipped the troops out of his own pocket the appearance of the soldiers was also designed to impress his superiors attractive or distinctive uniforms could make a military career desirable to young men the peacock factor as late as 1914 the british army found that regiments with particularly striking offduty or parade uniforms found it easier to attract recruits thus the four rifle regiments in their sombre dark green had a higher public profile than the great mass of line infantry in scarlet nationalism  editduring the boxer rebellion the muslim gansu braves under general dong fuxiang used traditional chinese clothing instead of westernstyle uniforms reflecting the opposition of the movement to foreign influences 35 36visibility or camouflage  editthroughout the 18th and 19th centuries the typical colour scheme included bright and highly contrasting colour arrangements which made it easier to distinguish units in battle coloured uniforms were useful in enabling commanders to spot troop locations on battlefields that were often completely obscured by smoke from the black gunpowder used in both muskets and cannons large flags were another aid to coordination and location for commanders however with the growing prevalence of accurate rifles and other ranged firearms as standard weapons for infantry it was found from about the 1880s on that these colours made soldiers easy targets for enemies to shoot at a distance these weapons used a new smokeless powder that generated far less smoke leaving the battlefield unobscured by smoke and making brightly coloured troops into highly visible targets in reaction the various militaries beginning with the british army changed the colours predominantly to such ones that blended in more with the terrain such as khaki grey or olive drab for the purposes of camouflage in addition this idea was followed with uniforms suitable for particular climates and seasons such as white for snowy regions and tan for sandy ones now most armies have some form of camouflaged uniform such as the british disruptive pattern material  dpm many modern military forces now use a system of combat uniforms that not only break up the outline of the soldier for use on the battlefield during the daytime but also employ a distinctive appearance that makes them difficult to detect with light amplification devices such as nightvision goggles nvgs these modern digital print uniforms present a somewhat splotched appearance generally of somewhat muted colours that provide visual concealment in a variety of surroundings the us army now issues for all theatres of operations the army combat uniform acu which replaces the battle dress uniform bdu and the desert combat uniform dcu the colour scheme on these acus is a faded greengreytan pattern of randomappearing rectangular shapes pocket outlines on the front of the jackets are offset from vertical so as to present a less distinctive straight line for the eye to follow while using nvgs the us marine corps also issues similar uniforms with their marpat pattern the u s marines considered adopting cadpat for their new pattern however the canadian government owns the copyright for the pattern which it had been developing since 1988 the canadian government supplied information and manufacturers to help the marines with the development of their own computergenerated digital pattern pixelated uniform 37 though their uniforms are not designed to replace both woodland pattern uniforms and desert pattern since both woodland digital and desert digital patterns are available similarly the us air force has begun fielding digital pattern uniforms to their service members with those uniforms featuring a bluegreytan pattern logistics  editmassproduced uniforms are a good way to equip thousands of soldiers quickly and efficiently uniforms in standard sizes and designs are also easier to replace on campaign as an example english levies raised for service in ireland or the continent during the 17th century came to be provided with clothing purchased in bulk and often of a standard colour or cut this was however only a temporary wartime expedient and the development of uniforms as such had to wait on the formulation of a system of permanent regiments notably by the french monarchy see above psychological warfare  editthe appearance of the troops was often enhanced in some way to intimidate the enemy the tall mitreshaped caps worn by grenadiers in the 18th century made their wearers appear bigger and more impressive king frederick william i of prussia had a guard unit of especially tall men with tall mitre hats the potsdam giants prussian hussars wore the skull and crossbones  totenkopf on their hats from 1740 to 1918 this tradition continues into the present day with nose art and fin flash on combat aircraft the warriors of ancient sparta normally known for their austere lifestyle wore expensive red cloaks  citation needed reportedly this was adopted as the only colour on which the spilled blood of their enemies would not leave stains there is a popular myth that the historic red coat of the english soldier was adopted for the same reason in fact blood does show as a dark stain on red clothing and the british red coat originated as a historical accident possibly as a result of the relative cheapness of madder red dyes at the time of the english civil war in the mid17th century hair styles in military organisations usually follow civilian fashions but sometimes certain features are associated with soldiers in the late 19th century the ornate beards and moustaches worn by the officers of the day which complemented their rank and age were also worn by socially equivalent civilians in the 20th and 21st centuries the  high and tight  haircut often distinguished lowranking soldiers particularly infantrymen or in the united states marines and soldiers of all ranks the principal purpose however of the  high and tight  is to prevent lice and promote general hygiene modern regulations against beards also ensure a good seal is made around the face when using a gas mask
