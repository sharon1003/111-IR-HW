disorder 8 9 it is also used to treat high blood pressure 2adverse effects  editside effects of guanfacine are dosedependent 10very common 10 incidence adverse effects include sleepiness tiredness headache and stomach ache 6common 110 incidence adverse effects include decreased appetite depressed mood anxiety irritability mood changes insomnia nightmares dizziness lack of energy slowed heart beat low blood pressure feeling faint when standing quickly vomiting nausea diarrhea constipation dry mouth urinary incontinence and rashes 6typical side effects such as fatigue irritability and stomach upset can take a week or two to subside increases in dosage can have the same adjustment period interactions  editguanfacine availability is significantly affected by the cyp3a4 and cyp3a5 enzymes and medications that inhibit or induce those enzymes change the amount of guanfacine in circulation and thus its efficacy and adverse effects and likewise guanfacine affects those medications because of its effects on the heart it needs to be used with caution with other medications that may affect the heart likewise other medications that may cause sedation 6pharmacology  editguanfacine is a highly selective agonist of the α 2aadrenergic receptor with negligible affinity for any other receptor 11 however it may also be a potent 5ht2breceptor agonist potentially theoretically contributing to valvulopathy 12mechanism of action  editguanfacine works by activating α 2a adrenoceptors in the central nervous system this results in reduced peripheral sympathetic outflow and thus a reduction in peripheral sympathetic tone which lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure 13 in adhd guanfacine works by strengthening regulation of attention and behavior by the prefrontal cortex 14 these enhancing effects on prefrontal cortical functions are thought to be due to inhibition of c ampmediated signaling which is effected by the gproteins that are generally coupled to the postsynaptic α 2a adrenoceptors that guanfacine stimulates through binding 14 15pharmacokinetics  editguanfacine has an oral bioavailability of 80 there is no clear evidence of any firstpass metabolism elimination halflife is 17 hours with the major elimination route being renal the principal metabolite is the 3hydroxyderivative with evidence of moderate biotransformation and the key intermediate being an epoxide 16 it is also shown that elimination in patients with impaired renal function does not differ significantly from those with normal renal function as such metabolism by liver is the assumption for those with impaired renal function as supported by increased frequency of known side effects of orthostatic hypotension and sedation 17history  editin 2010 guanfacine was approved by the fda for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder for people 6–17 years old 8guanfacine is approved and marketed in the united states 18 and europe 19research  editguanfacine has been studied as a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder evidence of efficacy in adults is limited but one study found positive results in children with comorbid adhd 20 it may be also useful in adult ptsd patients who do not respond to ssris 7results of studies using guanfacine to treat tourettes have been mixed 21guanfacine has been investigated for treatment of withdrawal for opioids ethanol and nicotine 22 guanfacine has been shown to help reduce stressinduced craving of nicotine in smokers trying to quit which may involve strengthening of prefrontal cortical selfcontrol 231 mg guanfacine tablets see also  editguanabenz xylazine references  edit a b c d e guanfacine guanfacine tablet genpharm inc daily med genpharm inc march 2007 retrieved 9 november 2013
