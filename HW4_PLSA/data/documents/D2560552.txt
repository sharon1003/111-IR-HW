breaded crumbed oven fried chicken tenders that come out truly golden and truly crunchy and minimum mess – no fingers caked with batter and breadcrumbsthere is no story behind these crunchy oven baked chicken tenders quite simply these are the reasons why i make my crumbed chicken the way i do1 i love deep fried chicken anything “deep fried goodness” i call it i need a fried chicken fix quite regularly but my waistline can’t afford the real thing every time2 i rarely deep fry i hate the mess i feel like it’s a “waste” of oil unless i make deep fried goodness again shortly thereafter – which is unlikely plus i am a klutz so i have a fear of deep frying3 i adore crumbed breaded things give me anything crumbed and i’ll scoff it down it’s the only way i eat sweet breads that’s the fancy word posh restaurants use for offal4 i hate how when i crumb things my fingers get caked with the egg mixture and breadcrumbs irrational as it may be i hate the sticky mess5 when you bake crumbed things unless you are very generous with the oil in which case just deep fry it or bake the chicken to the point of almost burnt in which case the chicken is horrendously overcooked the crumb coating comes out with bits of breadcrumbs that are still white if you make crumbed chicken the usual way by dreading in flour then egg then breadcrumbs spray with oil then bake it there is no way your chicken comes out looking like this unless you photoshop it… so this is how i make crumbed chicken in the oven it comes out a beautiful deep golden brown all over the crumb is extra crunchy and sticks well to the chicken it has very few ingredients and you won’t end up with marshmallowman fingers when crumbing the chicken1 use panko breadcrumbs they are japanese breadcrumbs and are bigger than normal breadcrumbs which  more crunch compensating for not deep frying you can buy them in large supermarkets in the asian section for a fraction more than normal breadcrumbs or go to the asian store and stock up – super cheap2 toast the breadcrumbs lightly in the oven  this makes all the difference just toast them to a light golden brown so when the chicken is breadedcrumbed then baked they come out an even deeper golden brown all over and it makes them extra extra crunchyi find that this technique produces a much more even golden brown crumb than just spraying or drizzling with oil even when i was very generous  excessive with oil spray i still found that there were lots of “white” bits of crumb also with oil spray especially if you use a lot you can end up blowing breadcrumbs off the chicken what a waste of crumb  updated this is the new and improved technique i used to pan fry the breadcrumbs in a skillet with a bit of oil but baking it is easier hands off and the breadcrumb browns more easily3 skip dusting with flour then dredging in egg just combine the egg flour chicken and flavours into the same bowl as long as you use the right ratios so the batter is thick and sticky enough it works even better than doing 2 separate steps ie dredge in flour then dredge in egg – and saves on mess4 and my favourite tip – how to avoid “marshmallow man” fingers when crumbing they say a picture says a thousand words so here are my baby hands in action showing you how i do itstep by step photos from my parmesan baked chicken tenders same breadingcrumbing techniquepretty darn clean fingers yayi served these crispy oven baked chicken tenders with a ranch dip because…well i had some leftover in the fridge but actually it doesn’t need a sauce there’s plenty of flavour coated onto the chicken before crumbing it i make these with chicken tenderloins which are a really lean cut of chicken it’s effectively the same as cutting chicken breast into strips i’ve provided directions for this so one of the key tips i have is to cook these in a really hot oven so the crumb becomes a lovely deep golden brown without the chicken overcooking dry chicken is horrid hard to swallow you will definitely need a dipping sauce if you overcook the chickencheers to many nights of guilt free “fried” chicken dinners – nagi492 from 97 votes print crispy oven baked chicken tenders

avoid blowing the panko off the tray then bake for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden transfer to bowl place a rack on a baking tray not critical but bakes more evenly place the batter ingredients in a bowl and whisk with a fork until combined add the chicken into the batter and toss to coat crumbing see photo in postpick up a piece of chicken with your left hand and place it into the panko bowl use your right hand to sprinkle some breadcrumbs onto one end of the chicken then pick up that end of the chicken and turn it over pat down gently to press the breadcrumbs onto the chicken then transfer onto baking tray repeat with remaining chicken spray lightly with oil bake for 10 minutes if small  15 minutes medium to large remove from oven and serve immediately with ranch dipping sauce note 2 and sprinkled with fresh parsley if desired recipe notes1 panko are japanese breadcrumbs which are larger than standard breadcrumbs nowadays they are available in all major supermarkets usually in the asian section and cost just a fraction more than ordinary breadcrumbs it is well worth using because the breadcrumb pieces are bigger so they create a far better crunch than standard breadcrumbs 2 update the method to brown the panko has been updated to a newer better method i used to brown it in a skillet now i bake it on a baking tray this browns it more evenly and its hands off time and theres one thing less to wash up the end result tastes exactly the same 3 ranch dipping sauce optional 14 cup each mayonnaise preferably whole egg and sour cream 2 tbsp milk 1 tsp lemon juice or white vinegar or any other light coloured vinegar 14 tsp each dried parsley or dill dried dill dried fresh chives note a garlic powder note b 18 tsp salt  black pepper place ingredients in a bowl and whisk to combine adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste a all the herbs can be substituted with fresh herbs finely chopped double the quantity  ie use 12 tsp dont worry if you dont have all the herbs if you have at least 1 it will still taste similar to what it should taste like just use more of the herbs you have 34 tsp dried herbs in total b the garlic powder is a key flavour component fresh garlic is not quite the same if you want to substitute with fresh garlic use 1 small clove mince it then make sure you set the sauce aside for at least 20 minutes to allow the flavours to develop 4 make ahead because these are tenderloins ie lean these are best served fresh rather than reheated these can be crumbed a few hours ahead then refrigerated until cooking i dont recommend preparing ahead any longer than that or crumbing then freezing ie raw because when the crumbing will get soggy so it doesnt crisp up as much it will still be crispy just not as much but still crispier than not browning crumbs so it kind of defeats the purpose of making the effort to brown the breadcrumbs before using 5 nutrition per serving assuming this serves 3 dip not included if you enjoyed
