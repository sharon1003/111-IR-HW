definitionsubstance that produces an allergic reaction in an individual termanaphylaxis definition aka systemic reaction or anaphylactic shocksevere response to an allergen without medical aid patient could die in minutes termantibiotic definitionmedications that are capable of inhibiting growth or killing pathogenic bacterial microorganisms termantibody definitiondiseasefighting protein created by the immune system in response to the presence of a specific antigen termantifungal definitionagent that destroys or inhibits the growth of fungiex lotrimin treats athletes foot termantigen definitionany substance that the body regards as being foreign and includes viruses bacteria toxins and transplanted tissues the immune system immediately responds to the presence of any antigen termantigenantibody reaction definition aka immune reactioninvolves binding antigens to antibodies this reaction labels a potentially dangerous antigen so it can be recognized and destroyed by other cells of the immune system termautoimmune disorder definitionany of a large group of diseases characterized by a condition in which the immune system produces antibodies against its own tissues termbacilli definitionrodshaped sporeforming bacteria termbacteria definitiononecelled microscopic organisms termcarcinoma definitionmalignant tumor that occurs in epithelial tissuetend to infiltrate and produce metastases that can affect any organ or part of the body termcarcinoma in situ definitiona malignant tumor in its original position that has not yet disturbed or invaded the surrounding tissues termcomplement definitiongroup of proteins that normally circulate in the blood in an inactive form and are activated by contact with nonspecific antigens such as foreign blood cells or bacteria complement then marks these foreign invaders and attracts phagocytes to destroy these antigens termcytomegalovirus definition cmv member of the herpesvirus family that cause a variety of diseasescan be found in most bodily fluids and can be present as a silent infectionpotentially cause a serious illness when the individual has a weakened immune systemcan be transmitted from mother to unborn child and cause serious congenital disabilities termcytotoxic drug definitiona medication that kills or damages cellsused as immunosuppressants or as antineoplastics termductal carcinoma in situ definitionbreast cancer at its earliest stage before the cancer has broken through the wall of the milk duct 100 cure rate at this stagetermhemolytic definitionfunction of destroying wornout red blood cells and releasing their hemoglobin for reuse termherpes zoster definition aka shinglesan acute viral infection characterized by painful skin eruptions that follow the underlying route of an inflamed nervesame virus as chicken pox but later in life term hodgkins lymphoma definition distinguished from other lymphomas by the presence of large cancerous lymphocytes known as reedsternberg cells termhuman immunodeficiency virus definition hiv bloodborne infection in which the virus damages or kills the cells of the immune system causing it to progressively fail thus leaving the body at risk of developing many lifethreatening opportunistic infections termimmunodeficiency disorder definitionoccurs when the immune reponse is weakened reduced absent or not functioning properly termimmunoglobulins definitionbind with specific antigens in the antigenantibody response termimmunosuppressant definitiona substance that prevents or reduces the bodys normal immune responseadministered to prevent the rejection of donor tissue and to depress autoimmune disorders termimmunotherapy definitiondisease treatment that involves either stimulating or repressing the immune response terminfectious mononucleosis definitioncaused by the epsteinbarr virus ebvcharacterized by a fever a sore throat and enlarged lymph nodes swelling of the spleen or liver involvement

termlymphadenopathy definition any disease process affecting a lymph node or nodes termlymphangioma definition a benign tumor formed by an abnormal collection of lymphatic vessels due to a congenital malformation of the lymphatic system termlymphedema definition swelling due to an abnormal accumulation of lymph fluid within the tissues termlymphocytes definition wbcs that are formed in bone marrow as stem cellscells undergo further maturation and differentiation in lymphoid tissues throughout the body termlymphokines definitionwhich are produced by the t cells direct the antigenantibody response by signaling between the cells of the immune systemattract macrophages to the infected site and prepare them to attack the invaders termlymphoma definitionterm applied to malignancies affecting lymphoid tissues termlymphoscintigraphy definitiondiagnostic test that is performed to detect damage or malformations of the lymphatic vessels termmacrophage definitiona type of wbc that surrounds and kills invading cells also remove dead cells and stimulate the action of other immune cells termmalaria definitiondisease caused by a parasite that lives in certain mosquitos that is transferred to humans by the bite of an infected mosquitosymptoms develop from 7 days to 4 weeks after being infected and include fever shaking chills headache muscle aches and tiredness
