thompson an introduction to research methods in sociology covering quantitative qualitative primary and secondary data and defining the basic types of research method including social surveys experiments interviews participant observation ethnography and longitudinal studies why do social research the simple answer is that without it our knowledge of the social world is limited to our immediate and limited lifeexperiences without some kind of systematic research we cannot know the answer to even basic questions such as how many people live in the united kingdom let alone the answers to more complex questions about why working class children get worse results at school or why the crime rate has been falling every year since 1995 so the most basic reason for doing social research is to describe the social world around us to find out what people think and feel about social issues and how these thoughts and feelings vary across social groups and regions without research you simply do not know with any degree of certainty what is going on in the world however most research has the aim of going beyond mere description sociologists typically limit themselves to a specific research topic and conduct research in order to achieve a research aim or sometimes to answer a specific question subjective and objective knowledge in social research research in sociology is usually carefully planned and conducted using well established procedures to ensure that knowledge is objective – where the information gathered reflects what is really ‘out there’ in the social world rather than ‘subjective’ – where it only reflects the narrow opinions of the researchers the careful systematic and rigorous use of research methods is what makes sociological knowledge ‘objective’ rather than ‘subjective’ subjective knowledge – is knowledge based purely on the opinions of the individual reflecting their values and biases their point of view objective knowledge – is knowledge which is free of the biases opinions and values of the researcher it reflects what is really ‘out there’ in the social world nb – while most sociologists believe that we should strive to make our data collection as objective as possible there are some sociologists known as phenomenologists who argue that it is not actually possible to collect data which is purely objective – the researcher’s opinions always get in the way of what data is collected and filtered for publication sources and types of data in social research it is usual to distinguish between primary and secondary data and qualitative and quantitative data quantitative data refers to information that appears in numerical form or in the form of statistics qualitative data refers to information that appears in written visual or audio form such as transcripts of interviews newspapers and web sites it is possible to analyse qualitative data and display features of it numerically secondary data is data that has been collected by previous researchers or organisations such as the government quantitative sources of secondary data include official government statistics and qualitative sources are very numerous including government reports newspapers personal documents such as diaries as well as the staggering amount of audiovisual content available online primary data is data collected first hand by the researcher herself if a sociologist is conducting her own unique sociological research she will normally have specific research questions she wants answered and thus tailor her research methods to get the data she wants the main methods sociologists use to generate primary data include social surveys normally using questionnaire interviews experiments and observations the major primary research methods social surveys – are typically structured questionnaires designed to collect information from large numbers of people in standardised form social surveys are written in advance by the researcher and tend to to be precoded and have a limited number of closedquestions and they tend to focus on relatively simple topics a good example is the uk national census social surveys can be administered carried out in a number of different ways – they might be selfcompletion completed by the respondents themselves or they might take the form of a structured interview on the high street as is the case with some market research experiments – aim to measure as precisely as possible the effect which one variable has on another aiming to establish cause and effect relationships between variables experiments typically start off with a hypothesis – a theory or explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation and will typically take the form of a testable statement about the effect which one or more independent variables will have on the dependent variable a good experiment will be designed in such a way that objective cause and effect relationships can be established so that the original hypothesis can verified or rejected and modified there are two types of experiment – laboratory and field experiments – a laboratory experiment takes place in a controlled environment such as a laboratory whereas a field experiment takes place in a reallife setting such as a classroom the work place or even the high street interviews – a method of gathering information by asking questions orally either face to face or by telephone structured interviews are basically social surveys which are read out by the researcher – they use preset standardised typically closed questions the aim of structured interviews is to produce quantitative data unstructured interviews also known as informal interviews are more like a guided conversation and typically involve the researcher asking openquestions which generate qualitative data the researcher will start with a general research topic in and ask questions in response to the various and differentiated responses the respondents give unstructured interviews are thus a flexible respondentled research method semistructured interviews consist of an interview schedule which typically consists of a number of openended questions which allow the respondent to give indepth answers for example the researcher might have 10 questions hence structured they will ask all respondents but ask further differentiated unstructured questions based on the responses given participant observation – involves the researcher joining a group of people taking an active part in their day to day lives as a member of that group and making indepth recordings of what she sees participant observation may be overt in which case the respondents know that researcher is conducing sociological research or covert undercover where the respondents are deceived into thinking the researcher is ‘one of them’ do not know the researcher is conducting research ethnographies and case studies ethnographies are an indepth study of the way of life of a group of people in their natural setting they are typically very indepth and longterm and aim for a full or ‘thick’ multilayred account of the culture of a group of people participant observation is typically the main method used but researchers will use all other methods available to get even richer data – such as interviews and analysis of any documents associated with that culture case studies involves researching a single case or example of something using multiple methods – for example researching one school or factory an ethnography is simply a very indepth case study longitudinal studies – studies of a sample of people in which information is collected from the same people at intervals over a long period of time for example a researcher might start off in 2015 by getting a sample of 1000 people to fill in a questionnaire and then go back to the same people in 2020 and again in 2025 to collect further
