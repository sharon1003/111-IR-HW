system in a computer file system and primarily used in the unix and unixlike operating systems the root directory is the first or topmost directory in a hierarchy it can be likened to the trunk of a tree as the starting point where all branches originate from the root file system is the file system contained on the same disk partition on which the root directory is located it is the filesystem on top of which all other file systems are mounted as the system boots up contents  hide 1 metaphor2 multiple root directories3 superroot4 related uses5 see also6 references7 external links metaphor  editto use the example of a physical file cabinet if the separate drawers in the file cabinet are represented as the highest level of subdirectories in the file system or system prompt then the room the file cabinet is in may be represented as the root directory that is the other directories may be inside it but the root directory cannot go in any other directories at least in that file system in most operating systems files can be placed inside the root directory as well as in its subdirectories one may envision this as placing paper files anywhere in the room or into any file cabinet within the room multiple root directories  editunix abstracts the nature of this tree hierarchy entirely and in unix and unixlike systems the root directory is denoted by the  slash sign though the root directory is conventionally referred to as  the directory entry itself has no name – its name is the empty part before the initial directory separator character    all filesystem entries including mountedfilesystems are branches of this root under dos os2 and microsoft windows each partition has a drive letter assignment labeled c for a particular partition c and there is no common root directory above that dos os2 and windows do support more abstract hierarchies with partitions mountable within a directory of another drive though this is rarely seen this has been possible in dos through the command join since it first was added to dos and can be achieved in all windows versions as well in some contexts it is also possible to refer to a root directory containing all mounted drives although it cannot contain files directly as it does not exist on any file system for instance when linking to a local file using the file uri scheme the syntax is of the form  filec  where  file  is the standard prefix and the third    represents the root of the local system in unixlike operating systems each process has its own idea of what the root directory is for most processes this is the same as the systems actual root directory but it can be changed by calling the chroot system call this is typically done to create secluded environment to run software that requires legacy libraries and sometimes to simplify software installation and debugging chroot is not meant to be used for enhanced security as the processes inside can break out 1 free bsd offers a stronger jail  system call that enables operatingsystemlevel virtualization and also serves security purposes to restrict which files a process may access to just a subset of the file system hierarchy superroot  editsome unix systems support a directory below the root directory normally  points back to the same inode as  however under munix  de this can be changed to point to a superroot directory where remote trees can be mounted 2 3 if for example two workstations pcs2a and pcs2b were connected via connectnodes and uunite startup script pcs2b could be used to access the root directory of pcs2b from pcs2a see also newcastle connection and network block device related uses  editroot on many unixes there is also a directory named root 4 confusingly it is not a root directory in the sense of this article but rather the home directory of the superuser conventionally known as root it is sometimes referred to as slash root 4vmsin the vms operating system the term root directory is used to refer to the directory in which all the users files are stored which is what unix calls the home directory the equivalent of a msdos perdisk root directory in vms is referred to as a master file directory
