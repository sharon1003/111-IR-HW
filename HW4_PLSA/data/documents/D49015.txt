characteristic which can be measured and which may vary along a continuumcontinuous variable eg height be more discrete eg family size or be bipolar eg sex theterm is commonly used in empirical social research to denote the representation of a social factorsuch as age social class employment status years of education which can be observed to affectother measures such as income level which may be influenced by all of those mentioned socialand psychological research is particularly interested in defining what aspects of society or experience influence other social parameters or behaviours with the intention of explaining socialphenomena on one view for this to be managed scientifically possible influences and possibleeffects have to be defined and quantified so that methods such as concomitant variation surveyresearch or experiment can be set up to test hypotheses it is these definitions andquantifications that result in the variables which are used in scientific data analysis it should be noted that continuous variables are measured on an interval scale while discrete variables often usenominal or ordinal measurement see criteria and levels of measurement  in some traditions in sociology however the appropriateness of the concept of the variable in theabove sense has been questioned from the perspective of symbolic interactionism forexample herbert blumer 1956 has suggested that the use of standardized variables in socialanalysis leads to a neglect of the close study required for the effective study of social situations and a distorted representation of social reality similar scepticism is voiced in approaches such as ethnomethodology see also measurement by fiat official statistics  collins dictionary of sociology 3rd ed © harper collins publishers 2000the following article is from the great soviet encyclopedia 1979 it might be outdated or ideologically biased variablea fundamental concept of mathematics and logic beginning with the works of p de fermat r descartes i newton g w von leibniz and other founders of higher mathematics a variable wasunderstood as a quantity that can vary—in the process of this variation it takes on different values variables were thus contrasted with constants—numbers or other quantities each of which has a unique completely defined value as mathematics developed and work proceeded on itsfoundations great pains were taken to exclude such concepts as processes and variation of quantities from the vocabulary of mathematics as being extramathematical the variableconsequently came to be interpreted as a symbol for an arbitrary element of the domain of objectsunder consideration—for example the domain of natural numbers or of real numbers in other words a variable was now seen as a generic name for the entire domain constants on the other handwere proper names for numbers or other specific objects in the domain under consideration this revision of the concept of variable was closely connected with the reorganization of mathematics on the foundation of set theory a process that was completed in the late 19th century for all the simplicity and naturalness of this reorganization it was essentially based on theabstraction of actual infinity this abstraction permitted arbitrary infinite sets to be considered as “given” “completed” “ready” “actual” objects to which all the methods of classical logic could be applied without regard for the incompletedness and the fundamental impossibility of completing theprocess of the formation of such a set the difficulties in solving the logical problems associatedwith the adoption of this abstraction make understandable the partial rehabilitation of the oldconcepts of variable quantities in constructing mathematical theories the representatives of someschools such as mathematical intuitionism and the constructive trend have preferred to make do with the weaker but logically less vulnerable abstraction of potential realizability this point of viewassociates infinite sets with the concepts of the processes of the sets’ generation—processes that go as far as desired but never end when investigating the problem of the consistency of differentfields of mathematics most mathematicians and logicians in effect adopt this position in formalized languages calculi or formal systems of mathematical logic the term “variable” is applied to any symbol of a strictly fixed type that under certain conditions permits an expression of the given calculus to be substituted for it such variables are called free variables an example is thevariable x in the inequality x  5 if say the numeral that is the symbol of the number 7 is substituted for x the inequality becomes a true statement if the numeral 2 is substituted theinequality becomes a false statement what are called bound variables do not mean anything in themselves but perform purely syntactical functions when certain elementary precautions areobserved bound variables can be “renamed”—that is they can be replaced by other variables an example is the variable y in the expressionsin the interpretations of which y does not appear and can be replaced by any other variable thusthe first expression which can be read “the sum of the integers from 5 through 25” can be replaced by the second expression which might be read “all numbers have the property p” can be replaced by ∀t p t individual proposition predicate function number and other types of variables aredistinguished they can be replaced in accordance with special substitution rules by symbols forrespectively the objects from the domain under consideration “terms” specific statementspredicates functions numbers and so on thus a variable in a formula can be meaningfullyunderstood as an empty place equipped with an indication that the place can be filled—the variable is like a container for a strictly defined piece of merchandise free occurrences of variables in the expressions of meaningful scientific theories and in theformulas of logical and mathematical calculi correspond to the use of indefinite pronouns in ordinaryspeech and permit of different interpretations one type of interpretation which corresponds to theuse of a variety of substitution procedures is the predicate interpretation the formula a x 1 … x n of some calculus is interpreted as an nplace predicate the same formula can also be interpreted as a proposition or statement specifically as the proposition ∀x 1 … ∀ x n a  x 1 … x n  which is a “closure” of the formula—this is the interpretation of universality which is commonly used forexample in formulating the axioms of various scientific theories finally to free variables there can be ascribed values constant within some context—for example the context of a conclusion from a given set of formulas the variables are then called the parameters of the context and we speak of the conditional interpretation for example the variable x in the expression cos x taken in isolationhas a predicate interpretation in the identity sin 2 x  cos 2 x  1 it has the interpretation of universality in the equation cos x  1 in the process of solving this equation when the variable is called an “unknown” it has the conditional interpretation thus at different levels of formalization the concept of the variable acts as a refinement of meanscommonly used in ordinary spoken languages—such as indefinite pronouns and indefinite articles—and of various methods of employing these means referenceskleene s c vvedenie ν metamatematiku subsecs 31 32 45 moscow

programming sometimes var veir or var a named memory location in which a program can storeintermediate results and from which it can read it them each programming language hasdifferent rules about how variables can be named typed and used typically a value is assigned to a variable in an assignment statement the value is obtained by evaluating an expression and then stored in the variable for example the assignment x  y  1 means add one to y and store the result in x this may look like a mathematical equationbut the mathematical equality is only true in the program until the value of x or y changes furthermore statements like x  x  1 are common this means add one to x which only makes sense as a state changingoperation not as a mathematical equality the simplest form of variable corresponds to a single word of memory or a cpu registerand an assignment to a load or store machine code operation a variable is usually defined to have a type which never changes and which defines the set of values the variable can hold a type may specify a single atomic value or a collection aggregate of values of the same or different types a common aggregate type is the array  a set of values one of which can be selected by supplying a numerical index languages may be untyped weakly typed strongly typed  or some combination objectoriented programming languages extend this to object

empty containers until a value is placed in them the values may remain constant or be updated in ram as the program runs variables are used as counters to sum totals and do math as well as to keep track of processes that are repeated within the program there may be dozens or hundreds of variables defined in a single application using cc as the example language the statement int counter defines
