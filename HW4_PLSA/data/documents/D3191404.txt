be obtained mrs kennedy stood at the left of mr johnson her eyes and face showing the signs of weeping that had apparently shaken her since she left the hospital not long before mrs johnson wearing a beige dress stood at her husbands right as judge hughes read the brief oath of office her eyes too were red from weeping mr johnsons hands rested on a black leatherbound bible as judge hughes read and he repeatedi do solemnly swear that i will perform the duties of the president of the united states to the best of my ability and defend protect and preserve the constitution of the united states those 34 words made lyndon baines johnson onetime farmboy and schoolteacher of johnson city the president johnson embraces mrs kennedy mr johnson made no statement he embraced mrs kennedy and she held

and p kenneth odonnell the appointment secretary both long associates of mr kennedy showed evidence of weeping none had anything to say other staff members believed to be in the cabin for the swearingin included david f powers the white house receptionist miss pamela turnure mrs kennedys press secretary and malcolm kilduff the assistant white house press secretary mr kilduff announced the presidents death with choked voice and redrimmed eyes at about 136 p mpresident john f kennedy died at approximately 1 oclock central standard time today here in dallas mr kilduff said at the hospital he died of a gunshot wound in the brain i have no other details regarding the assassination of the presidentmr kilduff also announced that governor connally had been hit by a bullet or bullets and that mr johnson who had not yet been sworn in was safe in the protective custody of the secret service at an unannounced place presumably the airplane at love field mr kilduff indicated that the president had been shot once later medical reports raised the possibility that there had been two wounds but the death was caused as far as could be learned by a massive wound in the brain later in the afternoon dr malcolm perry an attending surgeon and dr kemp clark chief of neurosurgery at parkland hospital gave more details mr kennedy was hit by a bullet in the throat just below the adams apple they said this wound had the appearance of a bullets entry mr kennedy also had a massive gaping wound in the back and one on the right side of the head however the doctors said it was impossible to determine immediately whether the wounds had been caused by one bullet or two resuscitation attempted dr perry the first physician to treat the president said a number of resuscitative measures had been attempted including oxygen anesthesia an indotracheal tube a tracheotomy blood and fluids an electrocardiogram monitor was attached to measure mr kennedys heart beats dr clark was summoned and arrived in a minute or two by then dr perry said mr kennedy was critically ill and moribund or near death dr clark said that on his first sight of the president he had concluded immediately that mr kennedy could not live it was apparent that the president had sustained a lethal wound he said a missile had gone in and out of the back of his head causing external lacerations and loss of brain tissue shortly after he arrived dr clark said the president lost his heart action by the electrocardiogram a closedchest cardiograph massage was attempted as were other emergency resuscitation measures dr clark said these had produced palpable pulses for a short time but all were to no avail in operating room 40 minutes the president was on the emergency table at the hospital for about 40 minutes the doctors said at the end perhaps eight physicians were in operating room no 1 where mr kennedy remained until his death dr clark said it was difficult to determine the exact moment of death but the doctors said officially that it occurred at 1 p m later there were unofficial reports that mr kennedy had been killed instantly the source of these reports dr tom shires chief surgeon at the hospital and professor of surgery at the university of texas southwest medical school issued this statement tonightmedically it was apparent the president was not alive when he was brought in there was no spontaneous respiration he had dilated fixed pupils it was obvious he had a lethal head wound technically however by using vigorous resuscitation intravenous tubes and all the usual supportive measures we were able to raise a semblance of a heartbeatdr shires said he was positive it was impossible that president kennedy could have spoken after being shot i am absolutely sure he never knew what hit him dr shires said dr shires was not present when mr kennedy was being treated at parkland hospital he issued his statement however after lengthy conferences with the doctors who had attended the president mr johnson remained in the hospital about 30 minutes after mr kennedy died the details of what happened when shots first rang out as the presidents car moved along at about 25 miles an hour were sketchy secret service agents who might have given more details were unavailable to the press at first and then returned to washington with president johnson kennedys hailed at breakfast mr kennedy had opened his day in fort worth first with a speech in a parking lot and then at a chamber of commerce breakfast the breakfast appearance was a particular triumph for mrs kennedy who entered late and was given an ovation then the presidential party including governor and mrs connally flew on to dallas an eight minute flight mr johnson as is customary flew in a separate plane the president and the vice president do not travel together out of fear of a double tragedy at love field mr and mrs kennedy lingered for 10 minutes shaking hands with an enthusiastic group lining the fence the group called itself grassroots democratsmr kennedy then entered his open lincoln convertible at the head of the motorcade he sat in the rear seat on the righthand side mrs kennedy who appeared to be enjoying one of the first political outings she had ever made with her husband sat at his left in the jump seat directly ahead of mr kennedy sat governor connally with mrs connally at his left in another jump seat a secret service agent was driving and the two others ran alongside behind the presidents limousine was an open sedan carrying a number of secret service agents behind them in an open convertible rode mr and mrs johnson and texass senior senator ralph w yarborough a democrat the motorcade proceeded uneventfully along a 10mile route through downtown dallas aiming for the merchandise mart mr kennedy was to address a group of the citys leading citizens at a luncheon in his honor in downtown dallas crowds were thick enthusiastic and cheering the turnout was somewhat unusual for this center of conservatism where only a month ago adlai e stevenson was attacked by a rightist crowd it was also in dallas during the 1960 campaign that senator lyndon b johnson and his wife were nearly mobbed in the lobby of the baker hotel as the motorcade neared its end and the presidents car moved out of the thick crowds onto stennonds freeway near the merchandise mart mrs connally recalled later we were all very pleased with the reception in downtown dallas approaching 3street underpass behind the three leading cars were a string of others carrying texas and dallas dignitaries two buses of reporters several open cars carrying photographers and other reporters and a bus for white house staff members as mrs connally recalled later the presidents car was almost ready to go underneath a triple underpass beneath three streetselm commerce and mainwhen the first shot was fired that shot apparently struck mr kennedy governor connally turned in his seat at the sound and appeared immediately to be hit in the chest mrs mary norman of dallas was standing at the curb and at that moment was aiming her camera at the president she saw him slump forward then slide down in the seat my god mrs norman screamed as she recalled it later hes shotmrs connally said that mrs kennedy had reached and grabbed her husband mrs connally put her arms around the governor mrs connally said that she and mrs kennedy had then ducked low in the car as it sped off mrs connallys recollections were reported by julian reade an aide to the governor most reporters in the press buses were too far back to see the shootings but they observed some quick scurrying by motor policemen accompanying the motorcade it was noted that the presidents car had picked up speed and raced away but reporters were not aware that anything serious had occurred until they reached the merchandise mart two or three minutes later rumors spread at trade mart rumors of the shooting already were spreading through the luncheon crowd of hundreds which was having the first course no white house officials or secret service agents were present but the reporters were taken quickly to parkland hospital on the strength of the rumors there they encountered senator yarborough white shaken and horrified the shots he said seemed to have come from the right and the rear of the car in which he was riding the third in the motorcade another eyewitness mel crouch a dallas television reporter reported that as the shots rang out he saw a rifle extended and then withdrawn from a window on the fifth or sixth floor of the texas public school book depository this is a leased state building on elm street to the right of the motorcade route senator yarborough said there had been a slight pause between the first two shots and a longer pause between the second and third a secret service man riding in the senators car the senator said immediately ordered mr and mrs johnson to get down below the level of the doors they did so and senator yarborough also got down the leading cars of the motorcade then pulled away at high speed toward parkland hospital which was not far away by the fast highway we knew by the speed that something was terribly wrong senator yarborough reported when he put his head up he said he saw a secret serve man in the car ahead beating his fists against the trunk deck of the car in which he was riding apparently in frustration and anguish mrs kennedys reaction only white house staff members spoke with mrs kennedy a dallas medical student david edwards saw her in parkland hospital while she was waiting for news of her husband he gave this descriptionthe look in her eyes was like an animal that had been trapped like a little rabbitbrave but fear was in the eyesdr clark was reported to have informed mrs kennedy of her husbands death no witnesses reported seeing or hearing any of the secret service agents or policemen fire back one agent was seen to brandish a machine gun as the cars sped away mr crouch observed a policeman falling to the ground and pulling a weapon but the events had occurred so quickly that there was apparently nothing for the men to shoot at mr crouch said he saw two women standing at a curb to watch the motorcade pass fall to the ground when the shots rang out he also saw a man snatch up his little girl and run along the road policemen he said immediately chased this man under the impression he had been involved in the shooting but mr crouch said he had been a fleeing spectator mr kennedys limousinelicense no gg300 under district of columbia registrypulled up at the emergency entrance of parkland hospital senator yarborough said the president had been carried inside on a stretcher by the time reporters arrived at the hospital the police were guarding the presidential car closely they would allow no one to approach it a bucket of water stood by the car suggesting that the back seat had been scrubbed out robert clark of the american broadcasting company who had been riding near the front of the motorcade said mr kennedy was motionless when he was carried inside there was a great amount of blood on mr kennedys suit and shirtfront and the front of his body mr clark said mrs kennedy was leaning over her husband when the car stopped mr clark said and he walked beside the wheeled stretcher into the hospital mr connally sat with his hands holding his stomach his head bent over he too was moved into the hospital in a stretcher with mrs connally at his side robert mc neill of the national broadcasting company who also was in the reporters pool car jumped out at the scene of the shooting he said the police had taken two eyewitnesses into custodyan 8yearold negro boy and a white manfor informational purposes many of these reports could not be verified immediately eyewitness describes shooting an unidentified dallas man interviewed on television here said he had been waving at the president when the shots were fired his belief was that mr kennedy had been struck twice once as mrs norman recalled when he slumped in his seat again when he slid down in it it seemed to just knock him down the man said governor connallys condition was reported as satisfactory tonight after four hours in surgery at parkland hospital dr robert r shaw a thoracic surgeon operated on the governor to repair damage to his left chest later dr shaw said governor connally had been hit in the back just below the shoulder blade and that the bullet had gone completely through the governors chest taking out part of the fifth rib after leaving the body he said the bullet struck the governors right wrist causing a compound fracture it then lodged in the left thigh the thigh wound dr shaw said was trivial he said the compound fracture would heal dr shaw said it would be unwise for governor connally to be moved in the next 10 to 14 days mrs connally was remaining at his side tonight tour by mrs kennedy unusual mrs kennedys presence near her husbands bedside at his death resulted from somewhat unusual circumstances she had rarely accompanied him on his trips about the country and had almost never made political trips with him the tour on which mr kennedy was engaged yesterday and today was only quasipolitical the only open political activity was to have been a speech tonight to a fundraising dinner at the state capitol in austin in visiting texas mr kennedy was seeking to improve his political fortunes in a pivotal state that he barely won in 1960 he was also hoping to patch a bitter internal dispute among texass democrats at 845 a m when mr kennedy left the texas hotel in fort worth where he spent his last night to address the parking lot crowd across the street mrs kennedy was not with him there appeared to be some disappointmentmrs kennedy is organizing herself the president said goodnaturedly it takes longer but of course she looks better than we do when she does it later mrs kennedy appeared late at the chamber of commerce breakfast in fort worth again mr kennedy took note of her presence two years ago he said i introduced myself in paris by saying that i was the man who had accompanied mrs kennedy to paris i am getting somewhat that same sensation as i travel around texas nobody wonders what lyndon and i wear the speech mr kennedy never delivered at the merchandise mart luncheon contained a passage commenting on a recent preoccupation of his and a subject of much interest in this city where rightwing conservatism is the rule rather than the exception voices are being heard in the land he said voices preaching doctrines wholly unrelated to reality wholly unsuited to the sixties doctrines which apparently assume that words will suffice without weapons that vituperation is as good as victory and that peace is a sign of weakness the speech went on at a time when the national debt is steadily being reduced in terms of its burden on our economy they see that debt as the greatest threat to our security at a time when we are steadily reducing the number of federal employees serving every thousand citizens they fear those supposed hordes of civil servants far more than the actual hordes of opposing armies we cannot expect that everyone to use the phrase of a decade ago will talk sense to the american people but we can hope that fewer people will listen to nonsense and the notion that this nation is headed for defeat through deficit or that strength is but a matter of slogans is nothing but just plain nonsense back to the top of this page
