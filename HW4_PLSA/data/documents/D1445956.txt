increasing functional capacity with physiologyguided therapycardiorespiratory fitness cfr also known as functional capacity fc or exercise capacity ec is the 1 predictor of longevity and allcause mortality fitness is quantified as the volume of oxygen metabolized at peak exercise in mlkgmin and is expressed as vo 2 max maximal muscle aerobic capacity or peak vo 2 highest level of o 2 consumption attained at peak exercise low levels of fitness peak vo 2 have been linked to decreased survival from heart disease stroke lung disease cancer kidney disease as well as increased incidence of hypertension diabetes high cholesterol dementia pneumonia and osteoporosis weak bones peak vo 2 is an accurate reflection of chronic diseases on the aging process and reflects the physiological “reserve” remaining in an individual based on age height weight and sex each person has peak vo 2 values that correspond to 100 of predicted individuals with peak vo 2  100 predicted live the longest with fewest health problems whereas those with peak vo 2  60 of predicted have the shortest survival with the most health problems in a dosedependent manner health care costs are also linked to low peak vo 2 lung disease copd heart failure and coronary heart disease represent roughly twothirds of the total cost of care to medicare and low peak vo 2 is the only common denominator“individuals whose peak vo 2 increases between examinations have a lower risk of adverse health and clinical outcomes than those whose peak vo 2 decreases and this should be communicated to patients” 11 ross et al importance of assessing cardiorespiratory fitness in clinical practice a case for fitness as a clinical vital sign ascientific statement from the american heart association circulation 201613400–00 thus the goal in every person is to increase peak vo 2 from baseline to provide objective evidence that longterm survival and healthcare costs are headed in the right direction increasing functional capacity peak vo 2 requires an intricate understanding of the mechanism of exercise limitation the cause of symptoms in patients with shortness of breath chest pain and fatigue therapeutic interventions must target the primary mechanism of exercise limitation for peak vo 2 to increase mettest has 14 years of realworld expertise in assisting primary doctors and cardiologists to more precisely identify the cause of exercise limitation and target therapy accordingly population risk management for atrisk organizations begins with precise riskstratification at the individual level and close tracking of changes in functional capacity with serial testing our data center provides detailed analytics and insight to administrators to enable them to see which segment of their population is headed in the wrong direction so that resources and interventions can be allocated accordingly to avoid the skyrocketing expenses of late stage disease how can mettest help you this 40 minute video was developed by the ascension health system to educate primary care doctors about the role of cardiopulmonary exercise testing  cpet to help diagnose conditions missed by routine testing the first 8 minutes provide an introduction to the testing modality and is followed by a 20 minute didactic session and 4 case studies ascension healthcare cme video a local interventional cardiologist highlights the value mettest brings to his practice to improve cardiac care for his patients abc news on mettestthis video demonstrates how mettest works with firefighters to improve heart disease prevention on an individualized basis the same principles apply to corporate wellness and atrisk organizations looking to reign in longterm healthcare costs powered by mettest heartfitforduty takes preventive care for firefighters to the next level heart fit for duty mettest works with firefighters dr suzanne steinbaum is a cardiologist and director of womens heart health at the heart and vascular institute lenox hill hospital in new york city and author of dr suzanne steinbaum’s heart book every woman’s guide to a heart healthy life she is national spokesperson for go red for women of the american heart association she was named to the board of directors of the american heart association in new york city in 2014 steinbaum has focused on the treatment of heart disease through education early detection and prevention she lectures nationally on women and heart disease coronary artery disease natural and alternative ways of treating heart disease through lifestyle modification and the prevention of heart disease changing the paradigm interested in becoming a partner site fill out this formsign up free for medical news and case studies
