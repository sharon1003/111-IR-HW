percent per year on average from the 148 billion comprehensive estimate developed previously for 1992 harwood et al 1998 the current update has developed new estimates for 22 major cost components and has applied various combinations of 18 different specific adjustment factors to account for 1992 to 1998 changes in for example incidenceprevalence of selected alcoholspecific

average annual increase in the estimated costs of alcohol abuse reflects changes in a number of factors between 1992 and 1998 national health expenditures grew an average of 61 percent annually gross domestic product growth averaged 53 percent adult population grew 09 percent per year consumer prices increased by 25 percent per year on average and worker compensation grew by an average of 30 percent annually back to table of contents methodology this report presents updatedprojected estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse using the same general approach that has been employed for this purpose in prior efforts eg harwood et al 1998 rice et al 1990 this update strategy is necessary to maintain reasonably uptodate cost estimates because of the effects of various trends in our society and the economy which while relatively gradual over a year or two may have a material impact over several years changes in actual costs of alcohol abuse between the year for which detailed estimates were developed and more recent years for which estimates are desired may be decomposed into two categories changes in the frequency and intensity of the underlying behavioral outcomes and changes in the monetary valuation of these outcomes this report measures changes in these components using the following indicators populationincidenceprevalence of selected alcoholrelated consequencesprices for health care servicesworker compensation wage rates and general prices the first two factors address changes in the real consequences of alcohol abuse specifically as total population increases one might expect the burden of alcohol abuse to rise proportionally however this conclusion relies on the assumption that the incidence and prevalence rates of the various adverse consequences of alcohol abuse remain more or less constant while there is highly detailed information about population change in the united states there is much less current data about the incidence and prevalence of alcohol abuse and its consequences other important changes over time affect the value of the impacts these changes are usually summarized by changes in the prices of goods and services  including the value of labor in the economy there are extensive data available about price trends in the u s economy cost of illness studies including harwood et al 1998 usually distinguish between the value of goods and services consumed and the value of labor productivity forgone as a result of the illness changes in the former are generally represented with factors such as the consumer price index or the medical price index while the latter are represented with measures of the cost of labor services  wage and salary indices the simplest approach to updating or adjusting cost estimates is to adjust the original total cost estimate for population change which grew by about 1 percent annually between 1992 and 1998 and the general change in prices consumer prices increased by an average of about 25 percent annually between 1992 and 1998 this approach is readily applied and the data are readily available and easily explained and understood application of these two factors results in an overall increase of 23 percent between 1992 and 1998 although this is fairly close to the 25 percent change actually estimated in this report there are disadvantages to such a limited approach there may be factors that lead various cost components to change at different rates across time relating to both real changes in behavioral outcomes and changes in subcomponent prices at the opposite extreme it is possible to return to the original calculation spreadsheets which involve hundreds or perhaps thousands of cells it is possible to adjust selected components representing either the real outcomes base population incidence or prevalence andor severity of impacts or the prices used in valuation without refreshing all of the data a middle level of complexity has been taken in developing the updated estimates for this report specifically the original cost estimates have been grouped into 22 major components the estimated costs associated with each of these components have been updated by applying adjustment factors to reflect changes in both the real consequences of alcohol abuse and the value assigned to the consequences most cost components have been updated by applying one or more adjustment factors to account for changes in the real consequences of alcohol abuse and another one or more adjustment factors to account for changes in the value of those consequences in the simplest cases such as the category lost productivity due to alcoholrelated illness this amounts to multiplying the 1992 estimate for a particular cost component by the ratio of the 1998 population to the 1992 population and then again by the ratio of the relevant price or wage index value for 1998 to the corresponding value for 1992 for some other cost components such as property damage due to motor vehicle crashes the real consequences have been updated using factors that are more specific to the particular outcome under consideration than simply overall population growth for a few cost components updating has been accomplished using only a single factor to adjust for both the real and price components of change for example health care costs for treating the medical consequences of alcohol consumption have been updated based on the growth in national health expenditures from 1992 through 1998 as reported by the health care financing administration the cost components and adjustment factors used in this report are summarized in table 2 the cost components are defined and described in harwood et al 1998 back to table of contents table 2 summary of

components selected as the basis for the update are briefly discussed below and sources publications for the data to be used in the updates are identified in the references alcohol abuse treatment the recent study by mark et al 1998 has developed estimates of spending on alcohol treatment from 1986 through 1998 however the most recent data available were for 1995 more recent estimates are updatesprojections based on historical relationships of costs of alcohol services to real and price factors and projections of those factors from 1995 to 1998 alcohol abuse prevention federal funds constitute a major share of funding for substance abuse prevention the change in federal spending on drug prevention office of national drug control policy 2000 has been used to trend spending forward to 1998 as many drug prevention initiatives also address alcohol this approach probably captures major trends in alcohol abuse prevention alcohol abuse research this estimate represents the budget authorization for the niaaa from the federal budget office of management and budget 2000 and reflects both real and price changes alcohol abuse training two factors were used for the update  growth in resident u s population u s bureau of the census 2000 and growth in the consumer price index for urban consumers u s bureau of labor statistics 2000 medical consequences of alcohol consumption this was updated using a single factor  change in national health expenditures cowan et al 1999 this measure encompasses both real and price factors however there is no adjustment for alcoholspecific trends medical consequences of fetal alcohol syndrome this was updated using a single factor  change in national health expenditures cowan et al 1999 this measure encompasses both real and price factors however there is no adjustment for fasspecific trends lost future earnings due to premature deaths this was estimated separately for alcoholrelated motor vehicle crashes national highway traffic safety administration 1999 and for all other alcoholrelated deaths centers for disease control and prevention 1999 adjustments also were made for growth in average earnings of workers using the bureau of labor statistics hourly compensation index u s bureau of labor statistics 2000 lost productivity due to alcoholrelated illness this was updated using the growth in resident adult u s population u s bureau of the census 2000 and growth in average earnings of workers hourly compensation index u s bureau of labor statistics 2000 lost productivity of victims of alcoholrelated crime separate adjustments were applied to violent crime and property crime these estimates were adjusted to reflect changes in the total number of violent and property crimes in the united states u s department of justice 1999 both values were adjusted for growth in the average earnings of workers hourly compensation index u s bureau of labor statistics 2000 no adjustment was made for a possible change in the causal role of alcohol in crimes lost productivity of prisoners the estimate was adjusted by the change in total census of prisoners u s department of justice 2000 and the change in average earnings hourly compensation index u s bureau of labor statistics 2000 crime  criminal justice expenditures separate adjustments were applied to violent crime property crime and alcoholdefined crime eg dui public drunkenness liquor law violations the first two subcategories were adjusted by the changes in the estimated number of these types of crimes committed u s department of justice 1999 the alcoholdefined crime costs were adjusted based on the number of arrests for alcoholdefined offenses price adjustment used the consumer price index for urban consumers u s department of justice 2000 social welfare administration this category was divided into two separate components for updating supplemental security income ssi payments and all other social welfare payments beginning in 1997 alcohol disorders no longer constituted an acceptable basis for ssi eligibility therefore this value was set to zero and no ssi costs were attributed to alcohol abuse after 1996 other major changes in social welfare becoming effective in 1997 have significantly reduced payments to beneficiaries this trend has been estimatedrepresented by the change in food stamp benefits u s department of agriculture 2000 while the social security administration ssa compiles national federal plus state estimates of social welfare outlays and particularly public aid publication of these data lags about 4 to 5 years  1994 data are the most recent available motor vehicle crashes  property damage this category has been broken into components associated with fatal and nonfatal accidents as noted above the department of transportation publishes data about alcoholrelated fatalities and injuries national highway traffic safety administration 1999 which have been used to make real adjustments to the original estimates the consumer price index was used to adjust for price changes fire destruction property and administrative costs due to alcoholrelated fires were updated using one factor  the estimated change in total fire losses in the united states national fire data center 1999 which represents changes in real factors and in the cost per fire no data are available to measure any trend of alcohol involvement in fires back to table of contents updated cost estimates for almost all of the adjustment factors identified above observations were obtained through calendar year 1998 for the few factors lacking 1998 data it was determined either to use the 1997 values or in the case of fire destruction to use the average of 1996 and 1997 because the data series for national fire losses varies from year to year although updated estimates have not been produced for 1997 nor for 19931996 these could be developed using the same approach as for 1998 values for the various adjustment factors for the entire 19921998 period are presented in the appendix the updated estimates for the cost components are shown in table 3 note that for presentation eg in table 1 several of the cost components were added together to construct summary components for example specialty alcohol services comprise alcohol treatment services the associated insurance administration expenses alcohol prevention alcohol research and alcohol training the update calculations indicate that costs of alcohol abuse grew from 148 billion in 1992 to 185 billion in 1998 approximately a 25 percent increase for an average annual increase of 38 percent there is a modest range in the projected changes in the various components the component with the highest rate of growth was productivity losses of persons incarcerated for alcoholrelated crimes this may seem somewhat incongruous since most of the other crimerelated cost components had relatively low or even negative rates of increase the apparent contradiction occurs because the number and rate of offenses fell strongly over the 19921998 period but the census of persons incarcerated actually increased by almost 6 percent annually over the same period thus the updated estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse presented in this report were based on the previously reported estimates for 1992 and on changes in population price and wage levels and health care expenditures between 1992 and 1998 for a few of the cost categories considered in this report the updating was based on changes in more specific outcomes of interest however it is possible that other changes occurred in the 19921998 period that affected the actual costs of alcohol abuse that are not reflected in the summary updating of cost estimates described in this report

alcohol abuse refers to any costgenerating aspect of alcohol consumption this differs from the clinical definition of the term which involves specific diagnostic criteria thus the costs associated with a single occasion of drunk driving that leads to injury or property damage would be counted in this framework even though this behavior would not by itself meet the clinical criteria for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse back to report2mark et al 1998 back to report3office of national drug control policy 2000 back to report4office of management and budget 2000 back to report5u s bureau of
