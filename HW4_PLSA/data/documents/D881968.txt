newest oldest best answer as long as you can pull it back when its flaccid for cleaning then it shouldnt be a problem and you should be able to feel the erection coming on to give you enough warning to pull it back down if youre worried and think its so tight it could cause a problem then you might want to mention it to your doctor at your next appointment just dont let him talk you into getting a circumcision some docs here in the states dont have a lot of experience with foreskins so they always fall back on the idea of circumcision whenever theres any problem i heard there is a simple procedure that is common in europe in cases where the foreskin opening is too small it does involve making a cut but they dont remove your foreskin  it just makes the opening bigger i just looked it up on the web and its actually called a partial circumcision that way you get to keep your foreskin and not have to worry about any problems with it dave s · 9 years ago0 0 comment if youre afraid of paraphimosis there is a stretching exercise that you can do when flaccid to widen the foreskin opening and facilitate mobility and retraction of the foreskin with the penis flaccid pull the foreskin all of the way out away from the body with the glans covered completely and stretched outwards insert the index fingers of both hands into the foreskin opening and gently but firmly pull in opposite directions at the tightest part of the inside foreskin this can be done daily morning and night and again with caution gently and gradually so as to cause a minimum of pain and discomfort trying to use too much force and rush it can cause scarring and damage this will take several months to accomplish a real widening of the opening but will enhance your sexual enjoyment with the foreskin being more mobile while erect you can pull back gently on the foreskin but again youre aware that you should avoid trapping the foreskin behind the glans while erect youre lucky to have a foreskin an
