hepatitis c redirected from hepatit c also found in dictionary thesaurus  hepatitis cdefinition hepatitis c is a form of liver inflammation that causes primarily a longlasting chronic disease acute newly developed hepatitis c is rarely observed as the early disease is generally quitemild spread mainly by contact with infected blood the hepatitis c virus hcv causes mostcases of viral liver infection not due to the a and b hepatitis viruses in fact before other viraltypes were found hepatitis c was referred to as nona nonb hepatitis it is not a newinfection just newly diagnosable and has been widely present in the u s population fordecades description hcv is a bloodborne virus that is and always was the major cause of transfusion hepatitiswhich can develop in patients who are given blood or most blood products except for gammaglobulin the existence of a third hepatitis virus besides the a and b viruses became clear in 1974 but hcv was first identified in 1989 thereafter tests were devised to detect the virus in blood units before transfusing them as a result since the early 1990s transfused blood is lesscommonly the cause of hepatitis c the hepatitis c form of hepatitis is generally mild in its early acute stage but it is much likelierthan hepatitis b 85 as compared to 10 to produce chronic liver disease therefore morethan two of every three persons who are infected by hcv may continue to have the virus in theirblood and so become carriers who can transmit the infection to others the most common way of transmitting hepatitis c is when blood containing the virus entersanother persons circulation through a break in the skin or the mucosa inner lining of the mouth or genitals hcv also can be passed although uncommonly from an infected mother to theinfant she is carrying the risk of infection from breast milk is very low also hcv can be rarelyspread through sexual intercourse usually however the sexual contacts of chronic carriers of hepatitis c are not infected those at increased risk of developing hepatitis c includehealthcare workers who come in contact with infected blood from a cut or bruise or from a device or instrument that has been infected contaminatedpersons who inject illicit drugs into their veins and skin especially if they share needles andsyringes with other usersanyone who gets a tattoo or has his or her skin pierced with an infected needlepersons with hemophilia who because they bleed very easily may require large amounts of blood and blood products over timepatients with kidney disease who have periodic dialysis—a treatment that rids their blood of toxic substances—and often requires the patient to have blood transfusions about onefourth of patients with hepatitis c do not belong to any of these highrisk groups although blood transfusion is a much less common cause of hcv infection than in earlieryears cases still occur also sexual transmission is possible and may take place with eitherheterosexual or homosexual behavior causes and symptoms more than half of all patients who develop hepatitis c have no symptoms or signs of liver disease some however may have a minor illness with flulike symptoms any form of hepatitis maykeep the liver from eliminating certain colored pigmented substances as it normally does these pigments collect in the skin turning it yellow and also may cause yellowing of the whites of the eyes about one in four patients with hepatitis c will develop this yellowing of the skincalled jaundice or yellow jaundice  some patients lose their appetite and frequently feel tired patients may also feel nauseous or even vomit in most patients hcv can still be found in the blood six months after the start of acute infectionand these patients are considered to be carriers if the virus persists for one year it is veryunlikely to disappear about 20 of chronic carriers develop cirrhosis scarring of the liver whenthe virus damages or destroys large numbers of liver cells which are then replaced by scartissue cirrhosis may develop only after a long period of time as long as 20 years and ofteneven more has passed most four in five patients will not develop cirrhosis and instead have a mild chronic form of infection called chronic persistent hepatitis and when they die will die withnot of the infection patients with chronic hcv infection are at risk of developing certain very serious complications patients with hepatitis c who develop cirrhosis may go on to have liver cancer—calledhepatocellular carcinoma patients with liver cancer have an average life expectancymeasured in months unless the tumor is totally removed patients also are at risk of developing a combination of joint pain weakness and areas of bleeding into the skin the kidneys and brain also may be affected perhaps 5 of patientswith chronic hcv infection develop this condition called cryoglobulinemia patients with porphyria metabolic disturbances characterized by extreme sensitivity to lightdevelop blisters in areas of their skin that are exposed to sunlight the skin also may be easily bruised and in time can become discolored diagnosis hepatitis c should be suspected if a patient develops jaundice and reports recent contact withthe blood of a person who may have been infected there is a blood test to detect hcv ig gantibody a substance that the body makes to combat hcv care is required as the test oftendoes not show positive for up to two to three months after infection also the test only showswhether a person has ever been infected by hcv not whether the virus is still present a lessavailable and more expensive test measuring hcv rna the viral gene can be found in earlyinfection before the antibody is measurable simpler blood tests can be done to show how muchjaundicecausing pigment is in a patients blood or to measure the levels of certain proteinsmade by the liver high levels of these liver enzymes called alt and ast indicate that theliver is inflamed rising levels could suggest that the infection is getting worse treatment patients who fail to recover promptly may be advised to see a specialist in gastrointestinaldisorders which include liver disease or infectious diseases a balanced diet with little fat is best and patients should limit their alcohol intake or better avoid alcohol altogether anymedication that can cause liver damage should be avoided the amount of time in bed depends on how poorly a particular patient feels a natural body protein interferon alpha now can be made in large amounts by geneticengineering and improves the outlook for many patients who have chronic hepatitis c theprotein can lessen the symptoms of infection and improve liver function not all patients respondhowever and others get less benefit the longer they take interferon fever and flulike symptomsare frequent side effects of this treatment using a high dose for six months nearly half of patients have responded positively half the patients who do respond well will relapse after thedrug is stopped a newer medication called ribavirin is now commonly used with interferon and if tolerated does increase response rates a newer form of interferon called pegylated interferon is also being used for treatment because of the problems with treatment many people havesought alternative medications such as milk thistle or certain asian herbs when hepatitis destroys most or all of the liver the only hope may be a liver transplant unfortunately the new liver usually becomes infected by hcv on the other hand total liverfailure is less frequent than in patients with hepatitis b prognosis in roughly onefifth of patients who develop hepatitis c the acute infection will subside and theywill recover completely within four to eight weeks and have no later problems other patients facetwo risks they themselves may develop chronic liver infection and possibly seriouscomplications such as liver cancer and also they will continue carrying the virus and maypass it on to others the overall risk of developing cirrhosis or liver scarring is about 15 of allpatients infected by hcv acute liver failure is less frequent in patients with chronic hepatitis c than in those with other forms of hepatitis prevention no vaccine has yet been developed to prevent hepatitis c in persons exposed to the virus in addition there is no role of gammaglobulin in the prevention of the infection there are howevermany ways in which infection may be avoided those who inject drugs should never share needles syringes swabs spoons or anythingelse that comes in contact with bodily fluids they should always use clean equipment hands should be washed before and after contact with another persons blood or if the skin is penetrated the sharing of personal items should be avoided particularly those that can puncture the skin or inside of the mouth such as razors nail files and scissors and even toothbrushes condoms should be used for either vaginal or oral sex if a person does develop hepatitis c its spread may be prevented bynot donating bloodnot sharing personal items with otherswiping up any spilled blood while using gloves household bleach and disposable papertowelscarefully covering any cut or wound with a bandaid or dressingpracticing safe sex especially during the acute phase of the infection key terms antibody — a substance formed in the body in response to a foreign body such as a viruswhich can attack and destroy the invading foreign body or virus carrier — a person who after recovering from a viral infection continues to carry the virus in the blood and can pass it on to others who then may develop infection contamination — passage of an infectious organism such as a virus from an infected person to an object such as a needle which then when used may pass infection to another person hepatocellular carcinoma — a dangerous cancer of the liver that may develop in patients whohave had hepatitis sometimes as long as

comdom q what is the difference between hepatitis c and hepatitis b and also can it be possible to have a false positive on a hepatitis b test a the main difference is that they are both caused by different viruses… they are both veryunpleasant diseases i hope you don’t have any one of them the other differences are that mostpeople 80 or so exposed to the hep b virus clear it on their own through their own bodysimmune response system with hep c only about 1520 of those exposed to it clear it throughtheir own immune system the rest go on to have chronic active hepatitis c he other major difference is that hep b can progress directly to liver cancer without progressing to cirrhosis first as hep c does here is an explanation about the testshttpwwwhepborgpatientsyourbloodtestshtm q what is the difference between hepatitis c and hepatitis b and also can it be possible to have a false positive on a hepatitis b test a they are caused by two different viruses don’t let the similar name fool you they have a different outcomes also about the test here is a bit of information about the testshttpwwwhepborgpatientsyourbloodtestshtmthis will help you understand them and check out for
