embedded system definition an embedded system is acombination of hardware and software which creates a dedicated computer system that performs specific pre defined tasks and which is encapsulated within the device it controls if it is part of a larger device3 industry development process requirement system specification delivery system system specification test system system design integration

characteristics of embedded systems• sophisticated functionality often have to run sophisticated algorithms or multiple algorithms often provide sophisticated user interfaces• realtime operation must finish operations by deadlines hard real time missing deadline causes failure soft real time missing deadline results in degraded performance many systems are multirate must handle operations at widely varying rates• low manufacturing cost• low power• designed to tight deadlines by small teams8 applications9 automotive systems technology in today’s vehicle• air bags • traction control• the black box • automatic parking• antilock brake • invehicle system abs entertainment• adaptive cruise • headsup display control • night vision• drive by wire• satellite radio eg xm • backup collision

control air bags egr control active suspension electronic fuel injection electronic ignition electric power steering pas electronic transmission cruise control antilock brakes11 air bags12 principle of function• it is from the newton’s 2nd law of motion• it basically restrains the continuous motion of the passenger by giving a soft surface to land on• air bags are among the most important safety improvements added to cars and light trucks in recent years providing extra protection for frontseat occupants in headon crashes• and of late every passengers protection13 air bag working before

informationsensing technology airbag deployment decisions fire airbag which airbags how much to inflate etc17 automobile accident reconstruction or the event data recorderedr or the the “black box”18 event data recorderedr• the event data recorder edr in an automobile is based upon the sensors and microprocessor computer system that are used to activate the airbag in the vehicle during a crash• the sdm which is controlled by a microprocessor has multiple functions• 1 it determines if a severe enough impact has occurred to warrant deployment of the air bag• 2 it monitors the air bags components• 3 it permanently records information19 event data recorderedr simplified block diagram engine speed vehicle speed brake onoff throttle pos sensor sensor sensor sensor preimpact data serial data bus sdm accelerometer warning indicator lowpass filter airbags power ignition switch microcomputer including edr ram 32k rom 640 eeprom driver seat belt manual pass sensor airbag cutoff sw and indicator20 black box  exterior21 black box  interior22 conclusion• the edr is not a replacement for the accident reconstructionist• the edr can be a source of additional data to confirm the conclusions of the accident reconstructionist• the edr may serve as an effective tool to impeach conclusions reached by accident reconstructionists who fail to consider the data generated by the edr• a lot of trial lawyers are going to be very busy litigating all of the issues the “black box” will generate during the coming years23 antilock braking system abs24 why abs  up until the seventies hitting the brakes too hard could lead to an accident the reason when the coefficient of slip between tires and road surface is too low hitting the brakes can cause wheel lockup the vehicle is no longer steerable and goes into a skid• in particular this danger is present on wet or slippery road surfaces with different levels of grip between tires and road25 on preventing wheel lockup reduce the total braking distance as far as possible increase vehicle stability maintain steerability even in case of allout braking26 its principle of functioning wheelspeed sensors detect whether a wheel is showing a tendency to lockup in case of a lockup tendency the electronic control unit reduces the braking pressure individually at the wheel concerned highspeed correction of the braking pressure up to shortly before the lockup threshold the brakefluid return together with the closedloop brake circuits makes this a safe reliable and costeffective system27 the components electronic control unit wheelspeed sensors hydraulicmodulator28 a basic antilock brake system sensor sensor brake brake hydraulic abs pump brake brake sensor sensor29 advantage• a gain for driving safety the vehicle remains steerable even in case of panic braking shorter stopping distances on practically all road surfaces• many accidents are avoided30 the difference with abswithout abs the vehicle the vehicle is remains no longer steerable even steerable during panic when the braking driver hits the brake31 dynamic traction  stability control32 introduction• the traction control system is required to prevent driver error from overloading any of the four wheels and causing slip through either throttle or brake application• drastically improve vehicle performance and safety by maintaining optimal wheel traction in all road conditions33 its principle• the basic principle is always the adaptation of the wheel torque to the coefficient of friction between the wheel and the road surface• to this end the systems make use of different intervention methods in the wheel brakes in the drivetrain control34 the principle of functioning of tcs with brakes without tcs the powered wheel spins –the wheel does not accelerate snow or ice asphalt with tcs intervention in the brake improved traction the vehicleaccelerates35 the principle of functioning of tcs with drive train control external slip angle sensors

intelligent cruise control• cooperative adaptive cruise control with collision warning cacc  cw• cacc cruise at given speed when the road is clear cruise control otherwise follow the car in front using radar adaptive andor communications cooperative• cw warn the driver when an object is being approached too fast or is too close x2 x1 r vehicle 2 vehicle 139 why this is hard…around curve rapid deceleration elevation changes dense traffic cutins40 how it works • uses forwardlooking radar installed behind the grill of a vehicle to detect the speed and distance of the vehicle ahead of it • can automatically adjust speed in order to maintain a proper distance between vehicles in the same lane41 car communication42 drive by wire43 drive by wire drivebywire replaces mechanical connections –
