chemistry how do food manufacturers calculate the calorie count of packaged foods jim painter an assistant professor of food science and human nutrition at the university of illinois explains credit john benson flickr cc by 20in order to answer this question it helps to define a calorie a calorie is a unit that is used to measure energy the calorie you see on a food package is actually a kilocalorie or 1000 calories a calorie kcal is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water 1 degree celsius sometimes the energy content of food is expressed in kilojoules kj a metric unit one kcal equals 4184 kj so the calorie on a food package is 1000 times larger than the calorie used in chemistry and physics the original method used to determine the number of kcals in a given food directly measured the energy it produced the food was placed in a sealed container surrounded by wateran apparatus known as a bomb calorimeter the food was completely burned and the resulting rise in water temperature was measured this method is not frequently used today the nutrition labeling and education act of 1990 nlea currently dictates what information is presented on food labels the nlea requires that the calorie level placed on a packaged food be calculated from food components according to the national data lab ndl most of the calorie values in the usda and industry food tables are based on an indirect calorie estimation made using the socalled atwater system in this system calories are not determined directly by burning the foods instead the total caloric value is calculated by adding up the calories provided by the energycontaining nutrients protein carbohydrate fat and alcohol because carbohydrates contain some fiber that is not digested and utilized by the body the fiber component is usually subtracted from the total carbohydrate before calculating the calories the atwater system uses the average values of 4 kcalg for protein 4 kcalg for carbohydrate and 9 kcalg for fat alcohol is calculated at 7 kcalg these numbers were originally determined by burning and then averaging thus the label on an energy bar that contains 10 g of protein 20 g of carbohydrate and 9 g of fat would read 201 kcals or calories a complete discussion of this subject and the calories contained in more than 6000 foods may be found on the national data lab web site at httpwwwnalusdagovfnicfoodcomp at this site you can also download the food database to a handheld computer another online tool that allows the user to total the calorie content of several foods is the nutrition analysis tool at httpwwwnatuiucedu answer originally posted on may 19 2003 rights  permissions latest news behavior  society did you buy bitcoins your brains anatomy might be to blame9 hours ago — angus chen public health surgeon general urges public to carry overdosereversal medication11 hours ago — andrew joseph and statpolicy  ethics shell grappled with climate change 20 years ago documents show12 hours ago — scott waldman and ee news arts  culture culture shapes how children view the natural world14 hours ago — jason g goldman public health huge trove of unknown viruses found in fish frogs and reptiles15 hours ago — giorgia guglielmi and nature magazine heres why the government should fund geewhiz science16 hours ago — monica bobra
