groundbreaking pony car and something else buyers found appealing a bigblock motor so while you could still get a gt350 in 1968 ol’ shel upped the ante with the bodacious gt500 which featured ford’s groundpounding 428ci 360horsepower engine under the hood armed with the 428 the gt500 was a top performer during the golden age of muscle cars when introduced in ’68 the gt500 turned in 0 to 60 miles per hour times of 62 seconds with a top speed of more than 130 mph these were serious performance cars something shelby himself insisted on and of course something that buyers wanted the gt500 especially in convertible form was a real rarity in 1968 that year ford manufactured 317404 mustangs which were the basis for shelby’s cars but in 1968 shelby built just 1542 gt500s only 402 of which were convertibles that means of the already rare ’68 gt500s roughly one in four had the highly desirable convertible top shelby built a total of 4450 cars during the 1968 run which included the gt350

sensitivity condition – but that doesn’t hinder his vision of the collector car market after riding the incredible rollercoaster ride that is barrettjackson for the last 20some years i can honestly say the 2018 scottsdale auction was 100percent validation of our ability as a team to turn what was once purely a car auction geared totally to enthusiasts and collectors into what is now by every definition a true worldclass event we had over 1700 diverse collector cars appealing to every niche interest and genre you can imagine we had celebrities we had titans of industry we had a former president of the united states we had the most anticipated car on the marketplace today being sold at no reserve – the 2017 ford gt – that pushed us over 100 million raised for charity to date we’ve created this highly entertaining rockandroll takenoprisoners magic environment that appeals to everyone from those with a net worth in the billions down to somebody who saved just to buy an entry ticket – they’re all coming in the same gate and they’re all taking away a different but equally memorable experience president george w bush at the 2018 scottsdale auction of course the heartbeat of it all the nucleus is the auction every two minutes there’s a car selling from the time you walk in until the time you leave – much of it broadcast around the world on live television there’s the excitement of bidding and the car of your dreams bringing a worldrecord price watching a winning bidder score a great deal on a vehicle wishing you had bid on a particular car it’s human drama the expectation the anticipation the “reality tvesque” appeal of barrettjackson “there’s the excitement of bidding and the car of your dreams bringing a worldrecord price…” the reality is there is a percentage of those who come to our events who aren’t primarily motivated by the auction itself there is a wonderful crosspollination of people who love cars people who love the entertainment people who love the excitement there are adrenaline junkies who want to experience the ride ’n drives or those who want to try their luck on the dyno at the ford display some may want to just come for the partylike atmosphere or shop in an exclusive malllike environment where you can buy everything from fashion and furniture to jewelry art and even jets others want to see the best and most unique vehicles in the world and talk to the people who know about the cars and the car culture “it’s a number of seemingly random components that capture you and dictate your voyage as you navigate through more than a million square feet and acres upon acres of coolness…” it’s a number of seemingly random components that capture you and dictate your voyage as you navigate through more than a million square feet and acres upon acres of coolness – but at the heart of it all is the profound love that people have with their automobiles the stories they reflect upon when they see the cars for me personally it reinforces that what we do is so much more than buying and selling cars it’s about impacting people in ways that only we can as a result of the platform we’ve created such as through all of the amazing monumental charitable moments on the auction block i mean to have a former president there with standing room only in the arena and everybody together celebrating the cause of taking care of our military men and women – now that’s a moment you can’t put a value on what that experience represented for the people in that room “a man with terminal cancer told his friends and family that the last thing he wanted to do in life was go to barrettjackson not only did he come to our scottsdale event but we arranged for him to ride in a car across the auction block” at every auction i’m reminded of how we’ve evolved into an event with a farreaching impact that goes well beyond the hardcore carguy auction that barrettjackson used to be we’ve had engagements and even marriages at our events i had a thankyou note recently from a family who has had four generations attend barrettjackson they’ve been coming since the very first auction a gentleman came up to me in las vegas and told me his late father put in his will that he wanted to be buried with his barrettjackson credential another man with terminal cancer told his friends and family that the last thing he wanted to do in life was go to barrettjackson not only did he come to our scottsdale event but we arranged for him to ride in a car across the auction block these are things we all take away from this and every one of us who works at barrettjackson owns a little piece of that it’s not a “job” it’s about touching peoples’ lives now we continue to build on the dream we’ve accomplished a lot of goals and now we add layers to the experience that’s really what this is all about the barrettjackson experience from a car auction to an event to an experience – that’s the evolution for a look at what vehicles will be adding to the experience of the 2018 palm beach auction click here pair of ferraris among featured vehicles in south florida collection heading to 2018 barrettjackson palm beach auction a stunning

the john staluppi cars of dreams collection the vehicles in the john staluppi cars of dreams collection come in all shapes and sizes here are three prized examples of the classic smallerisbetter philosophy 1959 fiat bianchina – trasformabile lot 3971 edoardo bianchi began building bicycles in 1885 and four years later turned his attention to motorcycles and automobiles in 1955 he struck a deal with fiat to supply his car company bianchina with technical components and volume production knowhow the result of this collaboration is this trasformabile convertible model based on the fiat 500 it offers a rear mounted aircooled twocylinder engine with a 4speed transmission this particular model had been a cherished member of the same family for almost 50 years that family bought the car new and it lived in the reno nevada area virtually all its life it still shows and drives beautifully thanks to a restoration performed early on originally white in color it has since been painted rosso red with black accents which was also a factory color combination although the engine is not a matchingnumbers unit it does carry all the correct components as original you may recall seeing the twin to this car in the original “pink panther” film starring peter sellers this rare homage to that movie star is offered with the original owner’s manual safe motoring hints booklet body parts manual and a special parts supplement 1971 fiat jolly custom convertible lot 3871 the chairman of fiat gianni agnelli wanted his company to make a small car he could carry on his 82foot yacht the agneta as a landbound “dinghy” so he could motor around and see the sights near the ports of the mediterranean it had to be lightweight so it could be readily lowered off the yacht and winched back on again when it was time to sail initially the jollys were powered by a twocylinder engine and based on the fiat 500 architecture then modified by coachbuilder ghia the roof and doors were deleted and wicker seats and a fringed surrey top were installed a version of this car was later based on the larger fiat 600 with production estimates of around 400 units this 1971 model has undergone a complete restoration and features recent paint and upholstery on the conventionally padded seats a rebuilt 500cc fourcylinder engine coupled to a 4speed transmission gives this little machine sufficient performance for all your coastline jaunts 1940 american bantam pickup lot 398 founded in 1929 a company based in butler pennsylvania was organized to sell a u s version of the austin 7 which would be referred to as the american austin the goal was to capitalize on the perceived interest of the drivers of the day for smaller vehicles obviously 1929 was not what you’d call a banner year for new businesses so after some early success the company was forced into bankruptcy the bantam’s production was restarted in 1937 and continued through 1941 after a run of 6000 units that included a variety of body styles such as pickups and woody wagons this restored minitruck is the perfect example of the company’s innovative spirit the yellow beauty runs and drives perfectly and can reach 50 miles per hour thanks to an inline fourcylinder engine with a 3speed manual transmission dependability has always been a bantam trademark as witnessed by their creation of the very first jeep prior to world war

ferrari 512 bbi lot 723 berlinetta boxer injected on offer the bb series was a major evolutionary step for ferrari rather than using a frontmounted v12 as had been the layout of the daytona the 365

dealers imported and legalized some for the american market this particular example being offered at palm beach is especially unique white over cream with impeccable red zegna wool inserts it cuts a striking profile it has just over 20000 miles on it and comes with all books and tools with the factory radio and equalizer still present 1972 ferrari dino 246 gt lot 722 ferrari was famous for its 12cylinder supercars but there was a time when the company made an effort to cultivate a wider audience with a more accessible affordable – relatively speaking – sports car that car was the dino line

20liter dohc v6 engine with three twobarrel carburetors the 206 gt was a different type of animal even so contemporary road tests of the car couldn’t help but note that its engine still sang a snarling ferrari song the dino 206 gt evolved into the 246 gt with a more powerful 24liter dohc v6 behind the seats the 1972 ferrari dino 246 gt lot 722 from the south florida collection that will be offered at palm beach is a fantastic example of the breed rosso red over black leather this car hits all the right ferrari notes a documented twoowner california car with just under 42000 miles it has

thru” testify to the idea that husky gasoline will take you where you need to go husky gasoline’s first signage showed the proud head of a male and more rarely female husky dog set on a bright orange and yellow burst of color the company expanded to a second refinery in riverton wyoming but then relocated to canada in 1946 not long after the relocation a logo change took place the new less

prowess once the car was announced i was driven to own one that matched my supercharged shelby gt” craig jackson with his barrettjackson edition 2008 ford shelby gt and his matching 2017 ford gt securing one of these american supercars was no easy task as ford stated that it would only offer 250 of them worldwide per model year that contrasts with the approximately 4000 of the secondgeneration ford gt built in 2005 and 2006 the application to purchase a gt was very comprehensive with points awarded for various enthusiastbased criteria ford wanted the cars to go to people who were influential in the collector car world so jackson and davis were each awarded one by the company’s performance division once the two men were notified that they were selected to be among the first to own new ford gts they faced the challenging task of personalizing them “my 1967 shelby was undergoing a complete restoration while i was completing that application process” explained davis “i had many photos of my grandsons next to the car throughout the sevenyear process which in many ways defined their childhood i determined that if i was lucky enough to get one my ford gt would sit next to my supercharged shelby in matching brittany blue with twin white stripes it was a big dream that fortunately came true” jackson opted to cloak his ford gt in black with barrettjackson red racing stripes just like his limitededition barrettjackson 2008 ford shelby gt that car which is serial 001 in the series was supercharged by the shelby factory in las vegas steve davis with his brittany blue 2017 ford gt and 1967 shelby gt350 once the handbuilt cars were delivered to arizona ford motor company surprised the men with a request to display the supercars and matching shelbys in their 2018 scottsdale auction display next to a merlotcolored ford gt press car as a bonus businessman ron pratte donated his liquid blue 2017 ford gt to charity for auction at the same event on the final saturday of the event that car sold for 25 million to benefit the autism society of north carolina “we were honored by ford’s request to place our ford gts and shelbys in their display” added davis “all of the fords looked equally incredible but each was important in a completely different way craig’s two cars were there promoting barrettjackson’s ‘driven hearts’ charity campaign born 50 years apart my 1967 shelby and 2017 ford gt sat side by side painted the same color this incredible snapshot represented five decades of performance for ford and years of a very personal journey by my family through our time in the collector car community” for jackson and davis who snagged ford racing team owner and le mans winner chip ganassi to sign their cars during the auction it was a very special moment they were able to share with everyone who attended barrettjackson “the unique display lived up to the excitement that ford hoped to generate” jackson noted “it also allowed the public to see that we are truly car people with a story just like them given the rarity of the cars there may never be another gathering of ford gts and shelbys in such a public forum again it was without question a special barrettjackson moment”japanese excellence the lexus lfa nürburgring edition is one exclusive supercar written by independent automotive journalist tom jensen one of the most exotic and desirable modernday supercars ever built a 2012 lexus lfa with the limitededition nürburgring package lot 724 will be crossing the block at no reserve during the 2018 barrettjackson palm beach auction one of the best parts about going to a barrettjackson auction is there’s something for everyone sure the huge numbers of muscle cars from 1960s and early ’70s are prime draws but there are also plenty of restomods and hot rods vintage pickup trucks foreign classics and even microcars as well as the occasional motorcycle also included in the mix are latemodel supercars with unbelievable levels of performance that the vintage rides could only dream of bidders at the upcoming barrettjackson palm beach auction will get a chance to bid on one of the most exotic and desirable modernday supercars ever built a 2012 lexus lfa lot 724 with the limitededition nürburgring package the v10 lfa was a rare bird in and of itself with only 500 handassembled for global distribution during the 2012 model year the nürburgring package was far more unique still with only 50 built that year and the orange lfa nürburgring package car crossing the block at no reserve in florida is a oneowner vehicle with just 1600 original miles make no mistake about it these were priced as supercars when sold new the lfa model itself carried an msrp of 375000 in 2012 with the nürburgring package adding 70000 more making the base msrp a cool 445000 so what differentiated the nürburgring package from the “standard” lfa first start under the hood while all lfas were powered by 48liter v10 engines the output in nürburgring package was 562 horsepower up from the standard model’s 552 the sequential 6speed shifter was faster in the higherend model which also carried sporttuned suspension exclusive black meshtype wheels and dedicated highgrip tires for better handling as well as a larger front spoiler and fixed rear wing for improved highspeed downforce on top of that the lfa nürburgring package was only offered in a choice of four exterior colors – whitest white orange black and matte black interior color choices were black red and violet all built with a carbonfiber center console and door trim the matte black paint was a 20000 option as you would expect performance was breathtaking with the lexus lfa nürburgring package accelerating from a standing start to 100 kilometers per hour in just 37 seconds and a quartermile flying by in only 114 seconds top speed was an eyepopping 202 miles per hour and lexus didn’t just pay lip service to the nürburgring the famous german racetrack buyers who purchased the lfa nürburgring package new were given one night’s lodging at the lindner congress and motorsport hotel nürburgring near the track private driver training with the nürburgring’s chief driving instructor and a nürburgring jacket among many other perks this was a serious highperformance car and lexus treated it as such so did the motorsports press “the most impressive aspect of the car is its stability at speed” wrote car  driver “we saw just over 170 mph out on the ring and somewhat lesser speeds on the autobahn and even then the thing feels as planted as a sequoia the great tree not the lumbering suv … the engine is stunning providing massive thrust from 4000 rpm and zinging upward to the 9000rpm redline its note is an incredible wail that sounds like an f1 car’s but quieter” “it goes without saying that lexus struck gold in its first foray into the realm of the supercar” added top speedcom “a remarkable achievement considering that before the lfa came to life the words ‘lexus’ and ‘supercar’ were as synonymous to each other as peanut butter and carrots” one of only 50 lexus lfa nürburgring package models ever built in 2012 this is a car

about a very special vehicle to be sold on the final saturday of the auction to benefit the aha a pristine white 35th anniversary chevrolet corvette the corvette had been gifted to craig jackson and his mother nellie at the 2006 scottsdale auction by longtime friend and barrettjackson customer dave ressler who passed away recently from heartrelated issues the stage was set to honor ressler’s memory and help the american heart association and on “super saturday” the corvette rolled onto the auction block driven by craig jackson’s daughter shelby who had learned how to drive in the car with ressler’s granddaughter ayden lynn in the passenger seat joining craig jackson and barrettjackson president steve davis onstage was american heart association ceo nancy brown who spoke about the importance of the cause before bidding began to a wildly cheering crowd the bids began to escalate until the hammer came down on 200000 – with the winning bidder being michelle mauzy the widow of greg mauzy a prominent member of the extended barrettjackson family known for his giving heart and philanthropic spirit who passed away in 2015 in a compassionate gesture reminiscent of something her late husband would have done michelle immediately donated the corvette back to be auctioned again a poignant moment that brought many – including craig jackson – to tears the bidding recommenced quickly reaching another 100000 from another loyal and generous barrettjackson customer joe riley – who also donated the car back to be sold again for the cause at the 2018 palm beach auction but the generosity didn’t stop there another kindhearted individual contributed an additional 50000 bringing the total raised for the aha to 350000 through the corvette’s sale darrell and charmaigne pullen with barrettjackson chairman and ceo craig jackson the pullens walked into the company headquarters to donate their 35th anniversary corvette for the driven hearts cause as the entire emotional sale played out on live television around the world environmental cleanup contractor darrell pullen was watching from his hotel room in texas where he was laid up with a bad flu he watched barrettjackson any chance he got and since he was “quarantined” it provided the perfect opportunity to watch the auction from beginning to end although pullen isn’t a car collector he’s owned a few collectible vehicles in his day and the one he currently had was a white 35th anniversary corvette – exactly like the one he saw going across the auction block for the aha “when i saw what cause the car was being auctioned for it hit home with me” says pullen who lost his mother just two years ago and his father 25 years ago both to heart issues in addition pullen’s older brother has had four strokes “as i was watching i could see the emotion going through the whole crowd seeing craig take his glasses off to wipe away tears i just decided right then i was going to give barrettjackson my corvette to auction if it could generate a little bit of money for the heart association that’s what i wanted to do” as it happened pullen and his wife had an opportunity to come to arizona just days after the auction had finished so he brought the title to the car with him he drove up to the barrettjackson headquarters in scottsdale walked in and handed that title over to an incredulous craig and carolyn jackson to bring in more funds for heart health as humble and kind as her husband pullen’s wife charmaigne simply said “good attracts good” it appears barrettjackson’s driven hearts campaign has a more farreaching impact than ever imagined we hope you’ll join us for this important ride for more information visit driven heartsorg two birds and a judge an iconic muscle car trio from john staluppi written by independent automotive journalist steve magnante one of two “birds” from the john staluppi cars of dreams collection headed to palm beach a 1970 plymouth superbird two birds and a judge drive into an automobile auction … it may sound like the setup to a joke in a hazy latenight comedy club but in the case of this trio of professionally restored muscle cars from the john staluppi cars of dreams collection the punchline is guaranteed to generate more than a few chuckles from the crowd the 440ci 6barrel engine under the hood of the ’70 superbird wellknown for his knockoutpunch bidding strategy at barrettjackson events for many years – and for generating tvcamerafriendly moments by occasionally using his pet dog’s paw to indicate bids – john staluppi has an expert eye for the best in automotive design legend and value in the case of this trio of no reserve offerings to be sold at the barrettjackson palm beach auction staluppi’s interest in toptier american muscle cars is on display to some the two “birds” heading for the auction block may be just a couple of old relics shiny relics for sure but otherwise of little interest but for the enlightened this 1970 plymouth 440 6barrel superbird and 1974 pontiac 455 super duty firebird trans am represent a fascinating display of how auto stylists can accentuate the nose and tail of a car to add image – and performance there’s no mistaking the missileshaped nose cone of the superbird in the case of the alpine white plymouth superbird the oversize missileshaped nose cone was put there in 1970 to help plymouth nascar drivers defeat their gm and ford opponents by piercing the air at over 200 mph just like a v2 rocket – or the boeing 787 dreamliner you might have flown in recently on business – pointy things pass through the atmosphere much more efficiently than blunt slabs thanks to that controversial nose cone the superbird helped plymouth dealerships to “win on sunday sell on monday” the “duck tail” spoiler on the firebird trans am is instantly recognizable as for the nose of the 1974 firebird trans am it played on a central pontiac design theme dating back to the 1959 model year that was when pontiac motor division stylists first embraced the split grille with a central “prow” design configuration as a way to build a quickly recognizable corporate identity on the open road when the firebird launched in 1967 as pontiac’s first pony car the prow was rendered into the front bumper so forcefully that some folks took to calling it a beak call it what you want it was marketing brilliance in how it visually tied all pontiacs into a cohesive family this matchingnumbers sd 455ci v8 engine powers the 1974 trans am super duty ready to cross the block in florida the tails of these two machines also exhibit some fascinating aerodynamic trickery designed to generate downforce at 150plus speeds during the highstakes factory racetrack battles of the day the superbird’s eiffel toweresque spoiler wasn’t meant to be pretty on the super duty trans am the exotic threepiece tail spoiler first appeared on 1970 models standardized on every firebird trans am built through the 1981 model year this “duck tail” spoiler is one of the most instantly recognizable styling touches of any car anywhere the superbird and super duty ta are both powered by their original matchingnumbers engines and drivetrains better still each has been verified by marque experts as being the real thing bid with confidence these are topnotch examples of topnotch collector cars also headed to the auction block as part of the cars of dreams collection is this 1969 pontiac gto judge ram air iv while many teenaged drivers of the original muscle car era actually found themselves standing before somber judges their right to drive hanging in the balance after some moment of youthful indiscretion this judge in this muscle car trio is sure to offer much happier proceedings a firstyear example of the gto judge option which ran from 1969 through 1971 this stunningly restored carousel red hardtop has something extra to offer it’s a true fully documented ram air iv better still it was factorybuilt with the closeratio m21 muncie 4speed manual transmission instead of the less exciting automatic that was also offered twin hood scoop advertise the ram air iv under the hood back in 1969 the vast majority of the 72287 gtos built were equipped with nonfunctional scoop inserts set into their sleek doublebubble hood skins only the hardy few stepped up to one of the extracost ram air engines – where the twin hood scoops became functional not so the judge to set it apart pontiac made sure every one of the 6833 judges built in 1969 had functional hood scoops for street credibility points for the most part the scoops fed the judge’s standardissue ram air iii 400 with a respectable 366 horsepower just 549 of the total number of judge buyers coughed up the extra 55820 needed to add the tiny roman numerals iv to the ends of the judge’s ram air hood scoop stickers those who did bought legends modern collectors treasure perhaps the ultimate gto engine of all time the 1969 ram air iv was the only gto engine equipped with an aluminum intake manifold the judge’s 400370hp ram air iv engine has been carefully restored to likenew condition despite the extra bakedin content pontiac’s marketing team rated the ram air iv at 370 horsepower it was a charade in reality the raiv was nudging 410 horsepower especially with its largediameter castiron exhaust manifolds highflow mufflers and plumbing another option that further elevates this particular judge into the stratosphere rpo 362 the 3901 gear set inside this judge’s safttrack rear axle allowing full utilization of the quickrevving ram air iv 400 it helps make this judge one of pontiac’s most fearsome muscle cars of all time so that’s the story of the two birds and a judge that showed up on auction day to rock the block no punchline required preview these and other vehicles headed to the palm beach auction here powerful icons two corvette fuelies ready to take on palm beach written by independent automotive journalist tom jensen heading to the 16th annual palm beach auction are two fine examples of chevrolet corvette fuelies from 1960 and 1965 both part of the john staluppi cars of dreams collection it only takes a single word to describe one of the most potent and iconic engines ever manufactured by chevrolet “fuelie” the fuelinjected 283290 engine under the hood of the 1960 corvette fuelie convertible coming to palm beach in 1957 chevrolet stunned the automotive world by introducing rochester fuel injection on its legendary smallblock v8 engine the fuelinjection system not only increased horsepower but it did a much better job of distributing the airfuel mixture equally to all eight cylinders than a traditional carburetor did the topofthelinefor1957 fuelinjected 283ci engine produced an astonishing 283 horsepower reaching the magic number of one horsepower for every cubic inch chevrolet would continue to produce fuelinjected smallblock corvettes through the 1965 model year increasing engine displacement and horsepower as it went all of which brings us to two pristine awardwinning examples of fuel injected corvettes that will cross the block at the barrettjackson palm beach auction which takes place april 1215 at the south florida fairgrounds both of these fuelies come from the john staluppi cars of dreams collection and both will sell at no reserve 1960 chevrolet corvette 283290 fuelie convertible the first of these is a true rarity a tasco turquoise 1960 corvette with matching interior and contrasting white coves on the side of the body during the 1960 model year chevrolet manufactured just 10261 corvettes which were available in a choice of eight colors of those 10261 just 635 – about one in every 16 – was tasco turquoise a hue offered only during the 1960 model year nearly as rare was the 290horsepower fuelie motor that this stunning car has – just 759 buyers ordered this motor the most powerful engine available in a 1960 corvette finding a tasco turquoise 1960 corvette is rare and so is finding a fuelie corvette of that same vintage this one even has power windows which came on only 544 1960 corvettes finding a tasco turquoise fuelinjected corvette with power windows is next to impossible – one of the factors that makes this car so desirable the 1960 fuelie has a matching tasco turquoise interior the other thing that makes this 1960 corvette so collectible is the lengthy list of awards and recognition it has received during competitive judging this car has received multiple highscoring top flight awards from the national corvette restorers society ncrs in 1989 and 1990 including 986 national top flight in 1990 it has also received other prestigious awards including the regional performance verification 1990 and duntov mark of excellence

1965 chevrolet corvette 327325 fuelie convertible fittingly the next fuelie from the john staluppi cars of dreams collection is a c2 model the generation manufactured from 196367 specifically it’s a 1965 corvette convertible trimmed out in gorgeous nassau blue paint over a black bucket seat interior the ’65 model year was the final time chevrolet offered its fuelie motor which by now was up to 327ci and 375 horsepower which made for potent acceleration of the five engines offered that year in the corvette the fuelie was by far the rarest out of nearly 24000 corvettes built in 1965 just 771 of them were equipped with the fuelinjected powerplant – that’s about one in 30 this fuelie lies under the hood of the 1965 corvette convertible ready for the palm beach auction the option list on this car is filled with great choices including telescopic wheel transistor ignition power brakes teak steering wheel power windows and offroad exhaust naturally it is equipped with a 4speed manual transmission and it also comes with highly desirable kelsey hayes knockoff wheels which add a definite sporting flair this corvette received a professional concours frameoff restoration in 2012 and

all that power was transmitted through chrysler’s torque flite threespeed automatic transmission when new the d500 would accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 8 seconds flat which was impressive especially for a fullsized convertible way back in 1959 in addition to the big motor this d500 has every available option offered that year including power seats with swivel option autronic

collection click here the founding families of barrettjackson “car people” have been the foundation of barrettjackson since day one here are the stories of those who made the company what it is today tom barrett june 1 1928 – april 20 2004 tom barrett loved collector cars and was a born “wheeler dealer” with a flamboyant style for nearly three decades “la paz” – tom’s estate in paradise valley arizona ‒ would see many thousands of the world’s greatest automotive masterpieces pass through its gates and it became the place where collectors from around the globe would travel to roam the garages and barns to inspect the rare classic cars and deal with the fearless man with his distinct showmanship style “tom loved the art of the deal” recalls craig jackson chairman and ceo of barrettjackson since 1995 “he equated it to pursuing a woman i remember him telling me ‘it’s the fun of the chase son’” born in oak park illinois tom moved to arizona in 1960 to become a real estate broker tom’s enthusiasm for cars was fueled at an early age ‒ despite the disapproval of his father a federal judge in chicago who wanted him to become a lawyer and thought his fascination with automobiles was not professional already a car collector at the age of 19 he used his enjoyment of classic cars in helping establish real estate business contacts with other collectors throughout the country tom’s passion for collecting cars combined with his showmanship style would soon become his main business and he would travel the world searching out grand cars that would later be recognized as some of the very best rarest and most expensive classic automobiles known throughout the world as an authority on values of great cars tom would earn the reputation as the “grandfather of the collector car industry” with his fingerprints on nearly every major classic car in existence tom’s love of the deal resulted in him going behind the iron curtain to chase down many incredible cars especially those that had been in germany during world war ii “he saved all those cars” says craig “i remember him bringing them home and driving those hugedisplacement mercedes bugattis oneoff classics and even early grand prix racing cars down 56th street in paradise valley those cars have become the crown jewels of some of the most famous and coveted private collections around the world” tom’s lifelong love of classic cars was evidenced by his longterm support of the classic car club of america in 1989 the ccca named the restored twostory antique barn at the gilmore car museum in kalamazoo michigan the thomas w barrett iii barn in tom’s honor although known for his love of classic cars tom’s enjoyment of all things automotive would see him become involved in the world of indy car racing in the 1980s having his own team in 1981 and being a sponsor at the indianapolis 500 for a number of years russ jackson november 19 1915 – january 30 1993 in 1963 tom placed an advertisement in the newspaper for a 1933 cadillac town car the respondent one russ jackson who loved old cars especially old cadillacs with big 12 or 16cylinder engines although the deal never materialized the two formed a bond over their common interest and a few years later formed the barrettjackson auction company born in michigan russ jackson grew up in pontiac and attended general motors institute in flint before becoming a salesman with local car dealerships and a member of the pontiac fire department russ married nellie jackson in 1940 and joined the air force a year later as a member of the ground crew working his way up the ranks to chief mechanic wanting nellie to remain at his side russ made sure nellie served as an accountant wherever he was based including bases in gulfport and biloxi mississippi as well as in california accommodation at some of those bases was at times less than stellar craig jackson remembers stories of his father living in a chicken coop while stationed at victorville california after world war ii came to an end russ owned and operated the successful russ’s country store just outside of pontiac from 1946 to 1960 the jacksons moved to arizona that same year seeking a drier and warmer climate because of nellie’s arthritis the family had been regular vacationers to scottsdale since the mid1950s spending time at the vista bonita ranch near pinnacle peak but the time had come to make a permanent move russ nellie and their sons – 14yearold brian and 1yearold craig – packed up everything and began the long drive in a threevehicle caravan nellie jackson august 7 1919 – february 10 2010 once settled in arizona the couple opened the fullservice super car wash where they secured a contract to wash scottsdale’s police cars and also did prep work and car washing for local auto dealerships in addition they owned and operated the classic carriage house where they bought sold rebuilt and refinished classic cars nellie was born in the automotive town of pontiac michigan with her first office job being in the cost accounting department at fisher body a division of general motors her affinity with classic autos began when she and russ purchased a 1934 v12 cadillac opera coupe from a junkyard they passed while on vacation the car moved with them from pontiac to scottsdale where they became very active in the classic car club of america nellie served as treasurer and was later elected as the first female regional director of the club during the mid1960s nellie’s everyday car was a 1937 cadillac v16 limousine the first of many collector cars she owned and drove daily she received the prestigious meguiar’s treasure of the collector car hobby award at the hollywood kodak theatre in june 2004 considered the matriarch of the barrettjackson auction company nellie jackson served as executive director for many years her passion for automobiles and business acumen were a driving force behind barrettjackson’s evolution into the world’s leading collector car auction company along with her husband russ and tom barrett nellie cofounded barrettjackson and held an executive position with the company since the doors opened in 1971 an early protégé of tom barrett’s was don williams now head of the prestigious blackhawk collection a lifelong devotee of classic cars don had been involved in successful dealerships – and a collector car auction – in california before moving to arizona in 1979 it didn’t take long before he joined forces with tom barrett russ jackson and brian jackson becoming a key member of the founding barrettjackson team craig jackson spent many a day restoring cars for don williams tom barrett and his father russ craig considers don a valued resource and trusted advisor to this day don remembers how nellie was always “the first to get to work and the last to leave” he recalls trying to beat her to the office sometimes but was never successful “she had a passion for the hobby and the business” he says “she possessed an amazing attention to detail and had a remarkable even phenomenal memory” apparently it wasn’t uncommon of nellie to recount the ownership history of all significant collector cars whether they’d been sold at barrettjackson at other auctions or through private sales brian jackson december 4 1945 – september 28 1995 “my mother was the foundation who grounded everyone at barrettjackson with her wit wisdom and caring spirit” says craig jackson the jackson’s oldest son brian was born in biloxi mississippi where russ was stationed in the air force during world war ii brian jackson naturally inherited a love of cars from his parents his first car was a 1936 ford that remains a treasured vehicle in craig jackson’s personal collection to this day while still in high school brian crossed paths with phil hill – the only americanborn driver to win the formula one world drivers’ championship which he accomplished in 1960 the two became fast friends and the summer after brian graduated from high school brian accompanied phil to europe for the filming of the 1966 action movie “grand prix” “my brother was a true baby boomer” says craig “he graduated in the early 1960s right around the era of ‘american graffiti’ i grew up hanging out with my brother and his buddies – brian often got stuck babysitting me” growing up in the era of great muscle cars and race cars brian developed a passion for scca and drag racing craig remembers brian spending a year traveling around europe and the united states with jim hall of indy car fame and builder of the winged chaparral race cars needless to say by the age of 26 brian was already wellindoctrinated into not only the racing world but the collector car world when his father partnered with tom barrett to form the barrettjackson auction company in 1971 he became an intrinsic part of the company early on when he wasn’t helping out at auction time however he usually could be found at a racetrack – including the beeline dragway in mesa arizona many times he raced his treasured 1965 shelby gt350 brian was among the first to become involved in vintage sports car racing in the mid1970s and often raced at the monterey historics his spare time would be spent at his race shop in phoenix where he and his friends worked on their cars brian took over management of barrettjackson in the early 1990s while russ jackson struggled and then passed away in 1993 from colon cancer a year later in 1994 tom barrett retired from active participation in the auction leaving it formally in brian’s hands brian jackson with his 1965 shelby gt350 brian and craig had often talked about what changes they might make when they ran the company the discussions mostly centered around creating the ultimate car lifestyle event one that lovers of the classics and new car enthusiasts could all enjoy in 1995 the brothers made one of many major steps in enhancing the lifestyle aspect of the auction experience by signing detroit “big three” automaker chrysler as the first presenting sponsor of the auction as part of its sponsorship chrysler set up a huge product display that included not only the company’s latest portfolio of vehicles but many of its historic classics like his father before him brian sadly succumbed to colon cancer in 1995 friends and fellow collector car enthusiasts remember him as an honest hardworking man who was dedicated to the car hobby – a dedication that continues to influence the barrettjackson team to this day “brian was instrumental in barrettjackson’s growth” says craig jackson “and gave me insights that still guide me to this day” that serendipitous meeting between tom barrett and russ jackson back in 1963 emerged into a partnership that would create one of the world’s most prestigious classic car auctions their initial enterprise was to set the tone for what would become the barrettjackson legacy “tom barrett and my father gave my brother brian and me a deep appreciation for all cars from the prewar classics to muscle cars and the incredible vehicles being built today” says craig jackson “they helped teach us how to appreciate and understand every detail of this business and it was their knowledge and drive that guided our path the legacy of tom my father and mother and my brother brian lives on with every auction we conduct today”the barrettjackson legacy russ jackson left and tom barrett what started as a simple meeting between two car buffs russ jackson and tom barrett in the early 1960s in arizona has blossomed over the years into the world’s most prestigious and anticipated collector car auctions and events the two men’s carbased friendship resulted in the families working together to stage the “fiesta de los autos elegantes” in 1967 a car show and parade held to raise money for scottsdale’s art center and to buy books for the community’s library – a commitment to philanthropy that remains with barrettjackson to this day by the fall of 1971 the car show was phased out and work began on a collector car auction to be held that winter seeded with 75 vehicles from jackson’s and barrett’s personal collections held next to the safari resort on scottsdale road the auction – with its star vehicles being barrett’s pair of mercedesbenz 770 phaetons built for the third reich and used for all its leaders – was reported live on the national weekend evening news over the years the auction grew exponentially moving to a larger space some 10 miles north to west world of scottsdale in 1989 where the massive automotive lifestyle event has remained ever since the 44th annual scottsdale event in 2015 marked the debut of barrettjackson’s new television coverage on discovery and velocity with 36 hours of live broadcasts throughout the united states and canada as well as in spanish to latin america ‒ another first for the company the 2015 scottsdale auction was highlighted by the extraordinary ron pratte collection of more than 140 incredible vehicles and 1500 outstanding pieces of automobilia the recordbreaking results sent shock waves throughout the collector car industry with automobilia sales nearly tripling the world record and attendance car sales charity funds raised and number of cars consigned witnessing a sizable increase the nineday event was historic on many levels former president george w bush at the 2018 scottsdale auction in 2018 barrettjackson achieved two more milestones at the flagship scottsdale auction the achievement of raising more than 100 million for charity since the company’s inception largely through the auction of vehicles for worthy causes and the first visit by a former president george w bush surprised the packed auction arena when he appeared on the auction to help sell a 2018 carbon 65 edition corvette donated by general motors which brought in 14 million to benefit his military service initiative the success of the annual barrettjackson scottsdale event

life today – particularly the cars we drive currently however the united states suffers from a deficit of scientific innovators with the demand for these professionals far outpacing the supply “the nation is in a stem crisis” admits lori gatmaitan director of the sae foundation actually it’s a crisis that has been a long time in the making the foundation was formed back in 1986 by sae international to support science and technology education which was in peril back then during the past 30 years the sae foundation’s initial efforts have “exploded” as gatmaitan puts it into sae’s comprehensive kindergarten through college stem education curriculum a happy tim whited center in 2013 after his winning bid on a 2014 cadillac cts vsport to benefit the sae foundation whited later became a member of the foundation’s board of trustees needless to say the nation’s automakers and others in the automotive industry are doing all they can to help the cause “our relationships with today’s automakers is strong” says gatmaitan “they are involved in all levels of sae’s stem education programs helping to inspire 5yearolds in kindergarten all the way to recruiting undergraduate and graduate students through sae’s collegiate design series” sae has also placed over 30000 volunteers in the classroom most of those representing oems and automotive industry suppliers it was general motors who first brought the sae foundation to the attention of collection car enthusiasts when at the 2013 reno tahoe auction they donated the first retail production 2014 cadillac cts vsport to be sold to benefit the foundation the car was purchased by businessman tim whited who now is a member of the foundation’s board of trustees where he is able to contribute in many ways to the foundation’s

year general motors funded the development of the curricular for sae’s first a world in motion awim it program focused on cybersecurity in which – among other things – students will explore network security regarding selfdriving cars from a fictional car company the program is one of a number of initiatives gm is taking to ignite more interest in stem careers fca which includes fiat chrysler and dodge has also thrown its support behind awim which they note will help inspire and educate nearly 3000 elementary and middle school students by teaching them critical math and science concepts in a handson interactive program – while exposing them to the possibilities that exist in stemrelated careers ford motor company efforts are known as “steam” rather than stem saying that adding the “a” for art sparks the creative right brain along with the logical left brain and keeping all avenues to inventive thinking wide open ford has eight different steam initiatives ranging from sponsoring robotics teams in a k12 competition through a national network of high school career academies to several college programs – including the ford college alliance which is a national network that

today totally trackworthy rusty wallace’s custom el camino written by independent automotive journalist steve magnante rusty wallace’s 1966 chevrolet el camino custom pickup lot 1318 will be crossing the auction block at no reserve on saturday january 20 what’s a nascar hall of famer doing with an el camino “i’ve always loved how chevy combined the comfort of a chevelle with the utility of a c10 pickup and in particular i totally dig the 1966 body style most of all” says racing legend rusty wallace whose custom 1966 chevrolet el camino lot 1318 will roll across the auction block in scottsdale on saturday january 20 selling with no reserve here’s another clue “with the taut suspension and rigid frame it handles like one of my race cars no exaggeration” wallace bought the el camino at barrettjackson a few years ago to use as a basis for a total rebuild and while the modification process was featured on an episode of velocity channel’s “inside west coast customs” he made sure west coast honcho ryan friedlinghaus and his team weren’t rushed to complete it “i’m really hung up on making sure gaps and body lines are uniform and as even as possible and ryan’s team really got it right” says wallace the car headed to kyle tucker’s detroit speed and engineering a leading pro touring modification shop located in mooresville north carolina – the heart of nascar country there the stock el camino chassis was replaced by a completely detailed unit from the roadster shop featuring fully boxed side rails triangulated reinforcements tubular control arms rack  pinion steering and corvette c6size fourwheel disc brakes a ford 9inch rear axle with 334 gears and a carbonfiber driveshaft work with a fortified 700r4 fourspeed automatic with overdrive for a great combination of docile highway cruising and hard acceleration this ain’t your mama’s el camino and though the box stock edelbrock hitorq 383 proflo xt efi crate engine installed at west coast customs was good for 408 horses it went to pro motor engines for a total blueprinting the resulting 505 dynoproven horsepower changed things wallace doesn’t mince words “the damned thing is just fast as hell but not so wild i can’t drive it anyplace i want” interior features include dakota digital gauges a highpower sound system and a vintage air climatecontrol system the west coast customs crew nicknamed the car “el rusty” in a bit of wordplay focused on its owner and model type the name was even used for the title of the tv episode featuring its initial build as catchy as it may seem let’s ignore the reference to oxidation’s damaging impact on steel there’s nothing rusty about this sleek hauler except for the guy who masterminded its creation – and spent many hours in its cockpit “it’s the sweetest el camino i’ve ever owned” says wallace now it’s your turn to jump in and enjoy rusty’s work for uptodate information on this vehicle click here from all work to all play the rise of custom pickups

for the latest news and information heading into the 2018 scottsdale auction fine feline the jaguar xke still turns heads written by independent automotive journalist tom jensen this firstyear etype jaguar roadster from 1961 lot 1392 trimmed out in opalescent dark blue paint over a stunning red interior will be crossing the barrettjackson auction block on saturday january 20 from its public debut at the geneva auto show in march 1961 the jaguar xke has delighted both skilled drivers and those who appreciate fine design elegance and style in a highperformance sports car the original jaguar xke or etype as it was known dazzled the critics with its mixture of sleek sensual lines british refinement and outstanding road manners when the display model arrived at geneva just 20 minutes before its scheduled unveiling it caused such a stir that jaguar test driver norman dewis was told to drop everything in england and drive all night to deliver a second etype to geneva for press rides the design of the new british sports car was a stunning success no less an authority than the legendary enzo ferrari described the etype as “the most beautiful car ever made” while the celebrated automotive journalist henry n manney iii famously called it “the greatest crumpet collector known to man” “stylistically the car appeared to come from the future” wrote phil patton in the new york times in 2011 while jaguar was celebrating the car’s 50th birthday “with its dramatic oval face and sleek body as feline and predatory as the jaguar name promised it arrived into a world of tailfins like a jet fighter among prop planes” appropriately enough patton’s story was titled “the jaguar etype is still an object of desire” oh yes it was an object of desire – and still very much is in this case though the beauty was far from skin deep mechanically the xke broke new ground too with such radical innovations as an aircraftstyle monocoque chassis inboard disc brakes and a powerful 38liter inline 6cylinder engine mated to a quickshifting 4speed transmission in short this jaguar represented a revolution in both sportscar design and technology so significant is the etype that even today 57 years after its introduction one is on permanent display at the museum of modern art in new york in the vintage sportscar world the jaguar xke is prized and adored by collectors and at the 2018 barrettjackson scottsdale auction on saturday january 20 bidders will have the opportunity to purchase one of the most desirable etypes ever built a firstyear etype roadster from 1961 lot 1392 trimmed

welded hood louvers flat floors and outside bonnet latches according to the consignor vin 875132 has undergone a painstaking and meticulous restoration done to the absolute highest standards this etype was completely disassembled with a team of master craftsmen paying strict and careful attention to documenting the process as they went about their work first the body was stripped to bare metal and given a full rotisserie restoration then it was restored and repaired with metalwork and lead where needed all the chrome trim and body parts were attached to the jaguar while it was still bare metal to ensure proper fit and quality next the body was primed sealed and finished in a base coat of opalescent dark blue which was then clearcoated that was followed by color sanding and buffing to a deep lustrous finish to highlight the elegant and sensual lines of the car the brightwork was replated to showquality and reinstalled as you would expect the mechanicals were treated to a painstaking and historically accurate restoration that included restoring or replacing the 4speed manual transmission clutch and hydraulics along with new rubber grommets and seals naturally the interior leather was replaced by master upholsterers in the correct red color which provides a chic and dynamic contrast to the deep blue paint a dvdmp4 of the restoration process along with a

april 17 1964 and it was successful beyond anyone’s wildest imagining ford projected annual mustang sales of about 100000 units from the time of its introduction until the end of 1965 ford sold more than 680000 mustangs as the car captured the imagination of young baby boomers but the mustang really wasn’t a highperformance car yes you could order it with a 289ci smallblock v8 but the mustang carried a lot of parts from the lowbudget ford falcon compact with general motors introducing the pontiac gto and the oldsmobile 442 in 1964 and chevrolet already building several fast cars ford needed a highperformance mustang to compete especially given that it had recently launched an aggressive public relations campaign under the moniker of “total performance” that’s when shelby was brought into the discussion ford enlisted shelby to approach the sports car club of america to find out what it would take to make the mustang eligible to compete in scca road racing so in the summer of 1964 shelby reached out to the sanctioning body’s executive director john bishop who told him that to race the mustang needed to have its back seat removed – the scca did not allow fourpassenger race cars – and could have its engine modified to make more horsepower or beef up the suspension and brakes but what they couldn’t do is add power and upgrade the chassis and oh by the way ford had to produce 100 examples of the car by january 1 1965 to comply with scca homologation rules and make it eligible to race in the bproduction racing class and challenge the chevrolet corvette after discussion with ford boss lee iacocca and other executives the project was given the green light and the shelby gt350 was born shelby’s company shelby american leased two airplane hangars at los

this vehicle click here all good things must come to an end the future of the viper written by chris griggs lot 1436 a 2017 dodge viper acr ta from the steve todhunter collection will be among the fine examples of the marque to cross the block at the 2018 barrettjackson scottsdale auction barrettjackson ceo craig jackson received his first newcar purchase – a 1997 viper roadster – at the viper assembly plant in detroit michigan the year is 1988 the u s auto industry has been struggling to figure out the formula to balance performance with rising emissions standards the corvette america’s sports car was finally back over the 200horsepower mark but it was still a far cry from the bigdisplacement highhorsepower muscle cars that ruled the late ’60s and early ’70s it looked like the days of big horsepower were only a memory now never to be seen again – but chrysler saw a different future to make this vision a reality head of global product development bob lutz looked to the past for inspiration the legendary shelby cobra tom gale at chrysler design heard lutz’s orders loud and clear when he was tasked with building a modernday take on the cobra the car debuted as a concept to the public at the north american international auto show in 1989 bearing the name “viper” as a snakethemed homage to the original inspiration the reaction was so positive that it was immediately approved to be a production vehicle crossing the auction block on saturday january 20 will be this 2016 dodge viper acr lot 12911 by 1992 the viper was ready hit the streets and a new era of performance had arrived the only thing more headturning than the radical styling were the performance numbers an aluminum v10 putting out 400 horsepower and 465 ftlbs of torque with a 060 time of 46 seconds and all of this while meeting modern emissions and fuel economy standards in the true spirit of the cobra the firstgeneration cars were very spartan offering a nofrills performance for those brave enough by 1996 several refinements had been made such as air conditioning and rolldown windows but power had been steadily increasing and was now up to 450 horsepower despite the brute monster the car was it was still very streetable in fact when barrettjackson ceo craig jackson broke his tradition of using collectibles as daily drivers and purchase his first brandnew car he went with a 1997 viper roadster the viper’s performance ignited a new horsepower race chevrolet and ford couldn’t sit idle and be bested by their crosstown rival and european manufactures realized they were no longer alone at the top of the sports car market what resulted over the next two decades was the resurgence of a war from the steve todhunter collection this 1996 dodge viper gts lot 1476 is selling at no reserve on saturday january 20 after 22 years of production dodge built over 25000 examples making them easily available on the secondhand market an older viper has always been a good entry point into the exotic and collector car market offering enthusiasts tremendous bang for the buck they have always had a steadfast presence on the barrettjackson auction block but recent years have seen prices on the rise since 2014 gen 1 vipers prices have risen approximately 42 percent on average gen ii 21 percent – and even gen iii are no longer looked at as just “used cars” with an uptick of 6 percent as production came to an end this year values are expected to continue rising with no new supply coming into the market another driving force is the influx of younger buyers into the collector car market chasing the cars they lusted after growing up – and every carcrazed kid in the ’90s had a poster of a viper on their wall while the viper made waves with its own performance its lasting mark will be the resurgence of performance it helped create forcing other manufactures to step their own game up and push the boundaries of what was possible in its final generation the viper put out an astounding

to west world of scottsdale the vast barrettjackson auction site at west world to barrettjackson ceo craig jackson the customer experience is paramount years ago when customers hinted that they’d like to occasionally take a break from the hours of bidding action in the auction arena jackson took note and barrettjackson evolved from just a collector car auction into a worldclass automotive lifestyle experience with a multitude of activities and attractions for people of all ages to enjoy when the company first moved its arizona event to west world of scottsdale in 1989 the auction arena was housed in a large temporary tent with most auction cars displayed on the grass or dirt grounds some covered by temporary tents and some open to the elements over the years barrettjackson which utilizes more than 75 acres of the 386acre events facility has continued to work in conjunction with the city of scottsdale to expand and improve the site the most notable improvements happened in 2005 with the addition of a moreorless permanent structure – known to many as the “city tent” – and in 2012 when there was a major 52 million expansion of the tony nelssen equestrian center where the current sponsor pavilion and auction arena are located more than 126000 square feet of additional asphalt has been installed at west world in preparation for the 2018 scottsdale auction in 2014 barrettjackson connected the equestrian center and the city tent by a structure recognized by guinness world records as the “largest singleunit marquee” and bringing the total “under cover” space occupied by the world’s greatest collector car auction to more than one million square feet – an important factor to those selling their prized polished collector cars at the event still a few tented areas remained where vehicles were displayed on fabriccovered ground rather than blacktop pads consignors will be happy to hear that is now a thing of the past in preparation for the january 1321 2018 auction more than 126000 square feet of additional asphalt has been installed and an additional 20000 square feet of indoor space has been added with a new 200footwide tent “as the collector car industry evolves so does our company” says jackson “we continue to find ways both large and small to improve the customer experience i’m confident our consignors in particular will be happy with this latest development” to view the vehicles for sale at the upcoming scottsdale auction click here driven hearts carolyn jackson spearheads barrettjackson’s yearlong charitable initiative

communities “my parents always drilled into me that it’s not enough to do well you have to do good” she says through barrettjackson and the jackson family foundation carolyn says it’s been a privilege to continue working with charities like tgen and childhelp which were so important to craig jackson’s late mother nellie jackson often this help manifests itself through the auction of cars to benefit these and other deserving causes “our charity cars sales are handsdown my favorite part of each auction” carolyn says “to watch the automotive community come together and see the impact it has on lives is the most fulfilling part of what we do it’s so profoundly rewarding to be able to participate in so many very special moments that take place on our auction block” in 2018 barrettjackson will

car collectors and contributed much to barrettjackson’s charitable efforts on the auction block” kicking off the driven hearts campaign is this 1988 chevrolet corvette 35th anniversary edition lot

be sold to benefit the tgen foundation behind the shades steve davis and lightning in a bottle steve davis’ dark glasses protect his eyes from a light sensitivity condition – but that doesn’t hinder his vision of the collector car market steve davis with representatives from dc solar at the 2017 las vegas auction looking back at my column in the last issue of the barrettjackson experience magazine it’s almost eerie i was talking about las vegas talking about my 1964 ford fairlane selling for charity there in the past talking about an amazing memory at that time none of us had any idea that this whole scenario would be played out again although under much more serious circumstances after the tragic shooting in las vegas we as a company had a lot of difficult decisions to make we decided we would be part of the healing process and create a moment that would symbolize us all coming together for the community i didn’t have any intentions on selling another of my “babies” for any reason really – but because of this overwhelming horrific event it seemed ordained that i should donate my 2007 ford shelby gt500 super snake for the greater good my fairlane had sold to benefit our service members this gt500 would be sold to benefit first responders the two causes are very important to me and very similar both groups share the same sacrifice in the sense that they literally are willing to give up their lives potentially if they’re asked to as part of their job description steve davis’ 2007 ford shelby gt500 super snake lot 3004 which sold for 1 million to benefit first responders at the 2017 las vegas auction we were physically in the shadow of where the terrible tragedy took place with the memorial on the strip the towers and the crime scene tape still up across the street you could not escape the gravity of the situation and the toll it had taken i can’t even put into words how sorry and griefstricken we are for those families and then think about what that would have been like if there were no first responders in the end we had one of those rarefiedair moments done in a positive and respectful way when my car came across the stage accompanied by an honor guard and a number of first responders many of whom were called into action on that horrible night and knew people who were lost it just became something that took on a life of its own this was taking place before thousands in the auction arena and before millions more watching on television or live streaming this was it we were allin and we knew what that car represented in its totality was more important than the dollars it was going to raise – it was going to do something incredibly good for these people and for the spirit of our country really the collector car community as a whole is a very giving group of people you see it in their eyes when they’re bidding – it’s all real tears and all the spirit the motivation the common experience that we all have in loving these cars is the same reason that a lot of these people are so generous and bighearted – like the team from dc solar who had the winning bid on my gt500 super snake i sold my fairlane in las vegas for 700000 then sold it again in scottsdale for 1 million and now my gt500 sold for another 1 million lightning in a bottle is one in a million twice is lottery odds – three times is unheard of we won the lottery three times for a cause it’s just very very fulfilling how many times in your life can you reflect back on something of that magnitude and quantify the result of that effort how many thoughts went out into the universe in a positive way about first responders when a charity car is in the zone the bidding takes on a life of its own and is fed by the passion and the excitement in the room when the smoke clears the prize is the memory that the vehicle represents when you take it home and every time you show someone that particular car that you bought at a barrettjackson auction for charity you tell the story it symbolizes that moment and what the charity represents and every time you look at that car you can think of the people this car helped and think of the positive energy created in the room when that car sold with carroll shelby in the passenger seat a 2007 shelby gt500 came onto the auction block at the 2006 scottsdale auction to sell for charity – the first time a brandnew vin 001 car sold at barrettjackson barrettjackson has long been known for its charitable contributions and corporate culture but its charity “juggernaut” really began at the 2006 scottsdale auction when – ironically – another gt500 made its way onto the auction block this was the first time we ever sold a brandnew vin 001 car a 2007 shelby gt500 which also marked the first time in nearly 40 years ford motor company and shelby automobiles had partnered to build a vehicle it was a defining moment that made worldwide news especially with edsel ford and carroll shelby together on our auction block once we did that successfully it kind of opened up the doors to other manufacturers and we’ve continued to grow on that and attract other incredible charity cars and causes in a true example of one incredible event spawning the next the cycle will continue in scottsdale at the very moment i was selling my gt500 in las vegas for charity i was on the phone with my good friend ron pratte who was discussing the donation of his brandnew ultrarare 2017 ford gt to the evernham familyracing for a reason foundation which will be offered in scottsdale to benefit autism that car will join a host of others to create more unforgettable moments from a personal standpoint it’s something that separates barrettjackson from everyone else in the industry we’ve created an incredible platform an incredible stage to not only bring buyers and sellers together and raise the bar for the collector car hobby but to do really great things for very good causes that have very deserving people as beneficiaries there’s nothing more fulfilling than that for a look at the vehicles coming up for the 2018 scottsdale auction click here the first 2017 ford gt to cross an auction block for charity is

almost nothing of significance happens in life without at least a little controversy attached even creating a car of enduring interest and collectibility brings out its share of detractors we’re talking of course about the famed 1963 splitwindow corvette stingray a singularly unique styling feature available for one year only the splitwindow corvette has become a favorite of collectors and one of those rare cars that even the general public recognizes and appreciates the controversy came about over the effect the divided back glass had on rearward visibility many inside gm argued against the feature but chief stylist bill mitchell was adamant that the split glass stay in place seeing it as a key element of the new design it was a classic “form versus function” argument the press piled on quickly picking sides even though they loved just about everything else about the new corvette “our only complaint about the interior was in the coupe where all we could see in the rearview mirror was that silly bar splitting the rear window down the middle” road  track noted in its review mitchell had won the battle but ended up conceding the war as the splitwindow was eliminated for 1964 replaced by a single piece of glass lot 1288 in sebring silver is another fine splitwindow corvette set to cross the scottsdale auction block whatever the feelings about the splitwindow the other features of the new stingray made the car an instant sensation beneath the sleek yet muscular design largely penned by larry shinoda was an independent rear suspension larger

finishing touches and getting ready to head to las vegas for our 10th annual auction tragedy struck like others around the united states the team at barrettjackson was profoundly shocked and saddened by the events on the last day of september in the city that had adopted us as part of their community long ago it hit particularly close to home when we learned our general manager and his wife were in attendance at the concert that night but had managed to get out safely sadly that wasn’t the case for thomas day jr the son of our longtime friend tom day who was among the victims of that horrific event roses at the 2017 las vegas auction in honor of thomas day jr it didn’t take long for us to decide that we needed to rally with the community and with our partners at mandalay bay the home of our annual auction to help with the healing in an incredible gesture of goodwill our company president steve davis and his wife janie decided to donate a very special vehicle to be auctioned to benefit the las vegas first responders without whom the fatalities would undoubtedly have been much higher than they were i can’t begin to describe the emotions we all felt when that very special 2007

number of world record sales at our auctions for fox body mustangs pickups and suvs from the ’70s and ’80s and land rovers and hummers from the late ’90searly 2000s volkswagen microbuses from the 1960s continue to do well and break records as do dodge power wagons from the 1950s with the dodge viper being discontinued i’ll think we’ll see some noteworthy activity involving them of course much of these trends have come about as a result of the increasing numbers of new – and younger – bidders entering the collector car hobby it’s encouraging to see younger generations become more and more enthusiastic about not only collector cars but the automotive industry as a whole something that has come about in large part due to a number of our valued partners – such as ford shell gm and sema –

scottsdale auction the legendary l88 a firebreathing corvette destined for the racetrack written by independent automotive journalist tom jensen one of just 80 built in 1988 this stunning l88 corvette lot 1418 is certain to attract a lot of attention when it goes up for auction on saturday january 20 at the scottsdale auction the midtolate 1960s were among the most turbulent times in american history an era punctuated by sex drugs rockandroll the youth movement the vietnam war protests and all manner of social upheaval in and around detroit where the big three u s automakers were based there was a war of another sorts raging an allout noholdsbarred goforthethroat horsepower war with chrysler ford and general motors each trying to outdo each other with ever more powerful engines – and each wanting to claim the bragging rights that went along with winning the horsepower war all of which makes what chevrolet did from 196769 seem all the more bizarre during that period chevrolet built 216 corvettes that at the time were the most powerful ever made and maybe the most powerful engines of any u s automaker then there was just one problem chevrolet didn’t want civilians – anyone who wasn’t a professional racer – to buy these corvettes and so they did everything possible to make them unattractive to purchase including ludicrously understating the horsepower they produced and pricing the cars astronomically high in the process despite their best efforts chevrolet created a legend that half a century later has grown ever larger we are talking of course about the l88 corvette a genuine firebreathing supercar with a trickedup 427ci engine under the hood chevy built just 20 l88s in 1967 80 more in ’68 and 116 in ’69 before pulling the plug for good here’s the deal the l88 was the product of the fertile imagination of chevrolet’s zora arkusduntov aka “the father of the corvette” who wanted a corvette to use for road racing at places like sebring and daytona but duntov didn’t want customers buying the l88 so it wasn’t advertised and its horsepower rating was a ludicrously low 430 below even the 435 horses available on the much tamer l71 engine in reality the l88 motor produced somewhere between 500 and 600 realworld horsepower with many experts suggesting it made 550575 horses whatever the actual number truly was it was big of that there is no debate the l88 package included a lightweight aluminum radiator 850 cfm carburetor 1251 compression ratio solid lifters pushing oversized valves a transistor ignition offroad exhaust heavyduty suspension and brakes a special hood and an m22 “rock crusher” 4speed manual transmission ordering an l88 meant you couldn’t have a radio heater power steering air conditioning or a fan shroud these were meant to be serious race cars driven only by professional racers on the track at the barrettjackson 2018 scottsdale auction on saturday january 20 a truly amazing l88 will hit the auction block lot 1418 is a stunning 1968 l88 one of just 80 built that year obviously given that the l88s were designed to go racing not all 80 survived at all and some of those that did were heavily modified in the process making lot 1418 all that more rare and desirable to own and it really is something special trimmed in le mans blue over a blue interior this car comes with the original build sheet national corvette restorers society ncrs shipping data report and full owner history back to the original selling dealer in chicago this l88 had a highquality noexpensespared restoration which the previous owner commissioned the car has achieved many awards including the prestigious ncrs duntov mark of excellence award ncrs performance verification award national regional and chapter top flight awards the coveted bloomington gold and the mcacn triple diamond award the original vin and trim tags are present on the vehicle as well in short this l88 is the best of the best a noexcuses noquestionsasked example of one of the greatest supercars ever produced in the 1960s the myriad awards this l88 has gathered attest to the meticulous quality of the restoration and savvy collectors know that over the long run you want to own the best example of a specific model you can find well folks this 1968 chevrolet corvette l88 just might be it and it will be up for auction at barrettjackson scottsdale on super saturday don’t miss out on your chance to own a legend for uptodate information on this vehicle click here the last detail an appreciation for the small stuff turned this big bad boss 429 into a likenew muscle car written by independent automotive journalist steve statham crossing the block at no reserve as lot 1410 on saturday january 20 at the 2018 barrettjackson scottsdale auction is this 1969 boss 429 mustang when it comes to the most desirable american muscle cars – and a boss 429 mustang surely belongs in that group – it’s the details that separate the mundane from the highestquality offerings the wimbledon white matchingnumbers 1969 boss 429 mustang lot 1410 to be offered at no reserve during barrettjackson’s scottsdale auction january 1321 illustrates that observation perfectly the restoration was performed with painstaking attention to detail “every part piece wire bulb nut and bolt has been meticulously restored on this car” the seller says “only the best went into this restoration including new exhaust ecs glass and decals fully restored tachman gauges clock and cluster” that level of detail is justified when tackling a boss ’9 built for only two years a mere 857 were made in the car’s debut year of 1969 and not all of them have survived into the 21st century – even fewer with the original drivetrain intact like this example the car achieved its fame thanks to its racebred pedigree and the eyepopping spectacle of its massive semihemispherical “crescent” cylinder heads topping the bigblock engine the boss 429 mustang’s sole reason for being was to homologate the boss 429 engine for nascar racing where engines were required to be available in production cars to qualify as a “stock car” motor the boss 429 v8 was actually used in the torino in nascar but the decision was made to put the street engine in the mustang for marketing reasons the engine did its part in nascar grand national racing though helping to propel ford to the 1969 manufacturers’ championship and david pearson to the drivers’ championship in a ford talladega known for its massive ports and valves that helped it breathe at racing speeds the boss 429 v8 needed to be detuned to operate in normal street traffic even so it was factoryrated at a stout 375 horsepower and 450 ftlbs of torque each 1969 boss 429 mustang was fitted with a tractionlok differential and closeratio 4speed to handle the power the boss 429 had so many unique attributes that it couldn’t even be built on a factory assembly line with other mustangs ford shifted production to kar kraft in brighton michigan where among other modifications the specialty shop replaced the stock shock towers with reinforced pieces that delivered more room installed a thinner brake booster and relocated the battery to the trunk to free up underhood space and improve weight balance visually the boss 429 mustang was instantly recognizable by its large functional hood scoop and chin spoiler more subtle modifications included beefier spindles relocated aarm mounting points thick front and rear sway bars staggered gabriel rear shocks and fenders modified to accept the larger wheel and tire package the kar kraft legend is well known by ford enthusiasts but this boss 429’s reconstruction to exact factory specifications was if anything even more meticulous the body was stripped dipped and ecoated and put back together with superior panel fitment “the hood decklid and doors open and close effortlessly” the seller states the undercarriage is as clean as the topside all brightwork has been professionally restored and polished the rear end suspension and 735 cfm holley carburetor were also professionally restored one functional but invisible upgrade was the switch to tm enterprises cylinder heads these replica heads mirror the factory heads externally but have superior flow characteristics are made of stronger aluminum and use head gaskets instead of the original oring design as you’d expect from a car that has received so much attention it comes with full documentation including marti report eminger letter original window sticker owner’s card boss 429 newsletters kar kraft book photos and boss 429 registry showing its been under the same owner for the last 17 years when it comes to detailing all of that is the cherry on top for uptodate information

this 1963 maserati 3500 gt spyder lot 1394 will be auctioned on saturday january 20 at the 47th annual barrettjackson scottsdale auction upon its introduction at the 1957 geneva auto show maserati’s 3500 gt marked a significant turning point for the storied italian sports car maker up to that point maserati focused on building racing cars supplementing them with a handful of highstrung thinly disguised racers for the road in order to stay viable in the face of competition from ferrari aston martin and jaguar they needed a flexible reliable sports car capable being built in more significant numbers with the 3500 gt maserati had its first car designed for volume production but they did not skimp on style or performance in the name of “mass” production at its heart was a 35liter twincam twinplug inline six that produced nearly 250 horsepower on a trio of weber carbs the engine was derived directly from the 350s sports racing car and traced its roots to the fabled 250f grand prix cars despite an eyewatering 13000 price tag in 1960 the 3500 gt proved to be popular with buyers with production reaching 2400 units between 1957 and 1964 more than any previous maserati model while the majority of 3500 gts were sold with coupe bodies by carrozzeria touring just 245 very lucky and wealthy buyers got their hands on the gorgeous opentopped spyder by carrozzeria alfredo vignale one look and it is easy to see why the 3500 gt vignale was seen as a direct competitor to the ferrari 250 california built just down the road in maranello the styling on the 3500 gt spyder was elegant and balanced and with the performance to match its good looks it was the epitome of italian grand touring in the early 1960s this gorgeous 1963 maserati 3500 gt vignale spyder lot 1394 that will be crossing the barrettjackson scottsdale auction block on saturday january 20 2018 is chassis number 1011145 delivered new in torino italy in the summer of 1962 it was imported to the united states in 1969 and spent many years in california and then texas it has recently been treated to a sympathetic restoration which was completed in 2017 in the original colors of blu sera over rossa leather the stunning vignale coachwork looks magnificent in dark blue with just a hint of metallic sparkle ferrari fans might notice a bit of 250 california in the shape of the rear quarters which is no coincidence as the maserati 3500 gt was a direct competitor to ferrari’s 250series cars a striking red leather cabin provides a beautiful contrast against the metallic blue paint the blue canvas softtop is fully lined for comfortable cruising in all conditions and the dash retains the factoryapplied blue paint as well as original gauges switches and steering wheel all in excellent condition the highly valuable factory tool kit and jack are included and even the ultrarare quilted trunk mat and hood insulation is intact and in amazing original condition as part of the restoration the engine bay is comprehensively finished with correct hose clamps wiring and plumbing while the chassis has been detailed with correct colored shocks brakes and other components as a 1963 model this car features many significant improvements over the earlier models such as 4wheel disc brakes a zf 5speed manual transmission and beautiful highly desirable polished alloy borrani wire wheels furthermore on this car the troublesome lucas mechanical fuelinjected engine has been replaced with a reliable and proven triple weber carburetor spec unit twinplug ignition dual overhead camshafts and raceproven design translate into 240 horsepower and near 150 mph performance beautiful rare vignale coachwork and the robust and powerful maserati drivetrain combine to produce one of the most desirable italian gt cars of the era this stunning machine fresh from restoration is a worthy addition to any collection a fabulous driving sports car with racebred dna from one of the most legendary italian marques of all time for uptodate information on this vehicle click here black beauty this original 1971 street hemi challenger exemplifies oldschool muscle at its best written by independent automotive journalist steve magnante this pristine unrestored 1971 dodge hemi challenger lot 1421 will be crossing the barrettjackson scottsdale auction block on saturday january 20 2018 the old saying that “history repeats itself” applies to the automotive world over and over when the first of the modernera dodge challenger srt 8s rolled off the assembly line on may 8 2008 a second detroit pony car battle erupted this one pitted the challenger srt 8 against ford’s successful neoretro 2005 mustang and gm’s gen5 camaro in 2010 the reborn challenger has spawned a new generation of mopar fanatics who are just as passionate as any baby boomer but we have to remember none of this would be possible without … the original ironically however while vintage challengers have become some of the most soughtafter mopar muscle cars among modern collectors and enthusiasts when they launched in 1970 it was a very different story with only just under 77000 dodge challengers built and sold challenger’s failure to recapture the youth market can’t be blamed solely on the car instead the triple reality of market saturation government intervention and shifting consumer demands conspired to deflate challenger’s appeal things got worse in 1971 as the soured marketplace squashed challenger sales down to 26299 it was into that turmoil that our featured blackonblack hemi challenger lot 1421 left dodge’s hamtramck michigan assembly line a mere 70 of those 26299 challengers built in 1971 were equipped with the legendary 426 street hemi of those 59 were coupled to the macho hurst pistolgripshifted 4speed manual transmission at the time insurance companies made hemi ownership very expensive most settled for less and took their challenger rts with the 440 383 or 340 engine offerings paying less for insurance coverage with each step down the performance ladder but for the few the proud nothing but a hemi would do the featured hemi challenger is unrestored and stands apart from most remaining examples thanks to its classy black paint in a color spectrum filled with psychedelic “hiimpact” hues with names like inviolet sassy grass green curious yellow panther pink lemon twist and torred basic black was a radical departure going further for 1971 dodge conjured exciting new longitudinal rt body side tape stripes but again the original owner of this classy standout wasn’t having any of it the only external plumage consists of the purposeful red and chrome diecast metal rt emblems affixed to the front fenders and trunk another example of lessismore is found between the highback bucket seats within the perfectly preserved interior the expected – and optional – center console is nowhere to be seen the result highlights the menacing banzaiswordlike pistolgrip shifter purposeful rubber boot and chrome trim plate behind the socalled “hemi transmission” an upsized dana 60 rear axle easily accepts the shock loads with help from special leaf springs that act like bolton traction bars better still inside the beefy dana rear axle 4101 gears – part of this car’s a34 super trak pak – boost acceleration and team with power front disc brakes to slow it all down better than the manual 4wheel drum brakes fitted to base rts all of this precious metal is the original stuff installed by dodge employees at the factory and there’s a galen govier certificate to prove it the wheels also support the lowprofile vibe with basic stamped steel rims wear utilitarian hubcaps and correct goodyear f6015 polyglas “boots” and like most items found on hemi mopars the rims have a special story they’re not simple “steelies” snatched from the dodge coronet station wagon parts bin rather they’re unique 15×7inch kelsey hayes items with specially steppeddiameter hoops welded to the same center “spider” used on mopar 14inch rims at the time 7inch wide rims were pretty exotic stuff released to suit the new breed of polyglas tires these “small spider” 15x7s were only offered in 197072 and are very rare their presence here speaks to this challenger’s originality and unaltered status with as much as 840 horsepower on tap from the new 2018 dodge challenger srt demon some wonder if the originals have finally been outdone we say no way that’s because the new breed has been civilized to pass today’s emissions and safety regulations they’re fun and definitely have a place in the collector car world but they can never match the sheer brutal nature of an original street hemi especially a 4speed what’s more as younger mopar fans attend mopar shows many are exposed to oldschool muscle cars for the first time they get the bug and end up filling their garages with something old and something new so go ahead and bid on this pristine unrestored example of the way things used to be from the sweetly rich aroma of precatalyst exhaust to the springloaded gas pedal they’ll never build ’em like this again for uptodate information on

gas pump globes hanging high above ron pratte’s prestigious car collection prior to their sale at the 2015 scottsdale auction lot 8910 at the 2018 scottsdale auction is a gorgeous late 1930s40s husky gasoline gas pump globe in a milkglass gill body back in the first half of the 20th century lighting out on the open road wasn’t as good as it is today when motorists were low on fuel they had to hope they would see a glowing globe atop a gas pump – a beacon of light to rescue them on their journeys much like a lighthouse was to ships at sea of course these colorful art deco orbs did more than light the way for desperate travelers they served as valuable advertising for over 1000 brands that existed back then the delicately painted globes displayed their own logos and colors and frequently even their own shape – sometimes veering wildly from the standard round form to more unusual threedimensional crosses crowns octagons donuts cubes and other figures such as the famous shell clam gas pump globes were added to pumps in the early 1900s and were the last decorative element of the gasoline pump to remain through the late 1950s after world war ii pumps started getting smaller and by the 1960s it was highly unusual to find a globe on one the globes were generally made from a ring of metal with a lens mounted on either side although onepiece glass globes were used in the 1910s through around 1930 initially the bodies were made of glass or metal rigid plastic began to be used in the late 1930s with the earliest bodies embossed “capcolite” near the base on one side another desirable gas pump globe offered at the 2018 scottsdale automobilia auction will be this westland buffalo gasoline narrowbodied milkglass example from the 1930s40s lot 8915 the types of globes are

soughtafter by collectors hull bodies similar to gill banded glass bodies ballcrank bodies onepiece glass ovals quite rare … and the list goes on “collectors have long prized gas pump globes as colorful unique accent pieces in their garages or places of business” says barrettjackson automobilia director rory brinkman “but they really soared in popularity when people saw how businessman ron pratte displayed them in his collection which sold at our 2015 scottsdale auction he had ingeniously turned them upside down and hung them from the ceiling of his museum over his prized cars – they created quite a mood when lit” depending on their rarity gas pump globes can start as low as several hundred dollars and can sell up to well into the tens of thousands of dollars at the 2016

automobilia docket click here the daring adventurer a chrysler de soto that represents the pinnacle of virgil exner’s design influence written by independent automotive journalist roger c johnson elegant and futuristic for its time this 1957 desoto adventurer convertible lot 1349 is headed for the 2018 scottsdale auction like the explorer for which it was named the de soto from chrysler corporation sought out new directions in the automotive world that meant innovation in styling engines suspensions transmissions market segments and even performance as a result the de soto would become the darling of a carcollecting hobby that maintains a love affair with classics from the ’50s even decades after their production ended the de soto was first conceived as a mediumpriced alternative for the carbuying public but would ultimately evolve into more of a lowerpriced luxury car either way it was competing mostly with other chrysler products rather than the gm and ford cars it was intended to challenge the de soto has always lived on the edge of probability since it was first introduced in 1929 at the beginning of the great depression when mediumpriced cars were taking the worst hit from a sales standpoint ironically the production of the de soto brand ceased towards the end of great recession in 1960 which hit the sales of higherend cars most of all the 1957 de soto adventurer lot 1349 you see here – which is crossing the block at no reserve on saturday january 21 as part of the 2018 scottsdale auction’s salon collection – may be the very pinnacle of virgil exner’s “forward look” design influence it captures the american public’s fascination with space travel rockets and jet airplanes – all within a single vehicle but chrysler’s strategy encompassed more than just exterior styling it was backed up with engineering to match this adventurer was de soto’s version of the chrysler 300 so it came with proper credentials a 345ci hemi wearing dual inline fourbarrel carburetors and generating one horsepower per cubic inch it was the first hint at this car’s performance capability which was proven on the sand of daytona beach a modern and wonderfully efficient 3speed torque flite transmission managed the hemi power on its way to the rear tires just push the button on the dashboard with your left thumb and you were off and running with the best of them chrysler’s torsionbar front suspension system gave this machine the handling to match its aggressive yet luxurious presence the car’s interior is lavish wellexecuted and offers a 6040 split bench seat up front and fullwidth rear seat the cockpit is trimmed in gold and white to match the car’s exterior hues golden threads were actually woven into the carpet to give it an even richer if not threedimensional look and feel nevertheless styling is the name of the game when it comes to collectible automobiles they had to look great when they were new and if the design was timeless they would continue looking great even generations later the smooth yet pronounced rear fins of this de soto and the tripletaillight configuration – culminating with integrated exhaust outlets right below them – are as much art form and function as they are breathtaking and spellbinding optional chrome wire wheels set this car off and contrast elegantly with the car’s otherwise futuristic look power drum brakes and steering add to the joy of driving this collectible another example of chrysler’s innovative engineering showed itself in 1957 with their adaptation of quad headlights to their product line thereby blindsiding gm and ford once again there were less than 500 adventurer convertibles produced during the brand’s threeyear production run spanning from 1957 through 1959 on one hand such low volume hastened the demise of this model but at the same time it added significantly to the stratospheric rarity where these cars are now positioned these jetage machines represent an era when designers saw the future with innocent yet eager eyes they were certain everything was possible and it was all just around the corner they were part of a sliver of time in america’s automotive culture that can never be duplicated but it can definitely be savored and since this particular car has only traveled 82000 miles in its life you’ll have a lifetime to savor it it’s time to take your own adventure and make this ultrarare example of a classic 1957 de soto convertible the cornerstone of your own collection to take the first step for this journey simply raise your hand when you see the

automotive journalist jonathan sierakowski a dream car for many this pristine 1966 aston martin db5 lot 1389 will be in the spotlight at the 2018 scottsdale auction a quick look at the aston martin db5 reveals why it is the quintessential model of the 1960s the exceptionally handsome coachwork design was by the italian firm carrozzeria touring stylish and charismatic its lightweight magnesiumalloy body built to the superleggera patent technique also enhanced performance the interior cabin was smartly appointed with modern amenities like full connolly leather trim reclining seats wilton wool pile carpets and electric windows the db5 incorporated many of the mechanical updates that had been first introduced into production of the db4gt namely the girling disc brakes with hydraulic servos and 15inch wheels with additional technical improvements that included an oil cooler and twin fuel tanks which were only incorporated on airconditioned examples like the one offered here one of the most significant improvements found on the db5 was under the bonnet the allaluminum twincam engine was bored to four liters which was then mated to a fully synchromesh zf 5speed gearbox its performance remains impressive to this day with the twincam six producing 282 brake horsepower at 5500 rpm and boasting a top speed of 142 miles per hour in british grand touring elegance performance wasn’t the only allure it was expensive costing £4175 in saloon form by comparison a morris minor 1000 was roughly an eighth of the price as such production was limited with only 923 of the db5 coupes like this one produced it is no wonder that this model was chosen to star alongside sean connery in the 1964 james bond film “goldfinger” legions of freshlyminted car enthusiasts now lusted for this tangible aspect of the bond persona and the model would be permanently vaulted to fame the db5 has retained such a magnetism since its “goldfinger” debut that it has appeared in six additional bond films the most recent being a cameo in “spectre” with daniel craig in 2015 over 50 years on and several enthusiast generations later the db5 has remained the quintessential grand

the ownership of james s hillhouse of denver colorado the current owner one of those individuals who counts himself among those legions of enthusiasts who always admired the db5 has had the remarkable

1967 ferrari 330 gt 22 written by independent automotive journalist tom jensen of the 1099 ferrari 330 gt 22s produced just 455 were series ii models – and this 1967 example lot 1393 at the upcoming scottsdale auction is one of them there is a simple but irrefutable truism in the world of collector cars if you’re looking for longterm value buy the very best example of the model you covet tastes change trends change what’s hot and what’s not changes too but what doesn’t ever change is that absolute toptier cars invariably prove to be better choices than lesser examples of the same make and model yes the best costs more always has always will over time though getting the finest car is the prudent and fiscally sound decision the finest quality pays off in the long run and that brings us to the current feature car that will roll across the barrettjackson scottsdale auction block as lot 1393 it’s a gorgeous 1967 ferrari 330 gt 22 that has been meticulously and correctly restored by skilled craftsmen trained in the nuances and intricacies of the prancing horse marque so impressive was the work on this ferrari that it captured the “best in class award” at the prestigious cavallino classic event in 2016 organized by cavallino magazine a bimonthly publication dedicated to the history of ferrari this is the show where the best of the best ferraris are displayed and admired each year winning here is indeed a big deal this pristine ferrari was styled by the legendary italian designer pininfarina and it’s trimmed out in black paint over red leather an extremely desirable color combination to make a black car capable of winning awards at a ferrari show the bodywork has to be absolutely perfect because black is the one automotive color that reveals any and all flaws but the restoration on this ferrari was stellar in every respect and will stand up to the closest scrutiny now for a bit of a history lesson the ferrari 330 gt 22 was introduced in january 1964 as a replacement for the 250 gte 22 which had evolved into the 330 america a car that looked identical to the 250 but sported a larger 40liter v12 engine the formal comingout party for the ferrari 330 gt 22 was at the brussels salon in 1964 where it was shown publicly for the first time the big news was under the hood where ferrari introduced a new engine a 60degree v12 known by the moniker type 209 slightly longer than the engine it replaced the type 209 engine was a 60degree singleoverheadcam v12 that produced 300 horsepower from its 40 liters of engine displacement like all ferrari v12s this motor is smooth and powerful with a unique and glorious exhaust note signifying its presence with authority three weber 40 dcz6 carburetors ensure plentiful distribution of the fuelair mixture that keeps this powerful ferrari grand tourer going strong the engine in this car is a matchingnumbers unit meaning it is original to this car and not a replacement block as found in so many mid1960s highperformance cars this ferrari also features books an extensive log of receipts and a full correct tool kit the original series i ferrari 330 gt 22 had four headlights an arrangement not to everyone’s aesthetic tastes but in mid1965 ferrari upgraded the 330 gt 22 to its series ii edition the version that will cross the auction block at barrettjackson scottsdale the series ii ferrari 330 gt 22 received a host of significant upgrades the headlights were changed to the more attractive layout of one to a side the car got a new and better gearbox and the old mechanical clutch gave way to a hydraulic one on the series ii models the interior received numerous improvements highlighted by a new center console and enhanced switchgear and ventilation outlets taken as a whole this series of improvements made an already dynamic grand touring machine even better from an exterior design standpoint the series ii 330 gt 22 now bore much more of a family resemblance to the ferrari 275 gts model – a good thing there were 1099 330 gt 22s produced not a huge production run to begin with but of those just 455 were series ii models when you combine rarity and the upgrades in features clearly the series ii model is extremely desirable whether you are a collector or driver it looks great in the garage and feels amazing on the road and it’s going to cross the block at barrettjackson

shelby gt350r lot 1425 headed to the scottsdale auction has been restored to its former racing glory – right down to the bright red frontend accents to make it stand out from the crowd on the track when carroll shelby accepted lee iacocca’s challenge to turn the 1965 mustang into a competitive racing machine that could take on the world’s best sports cars no one was fully aware of how productive this effort would ultimately become no one except iacocca and shelby apparently of the mere 36 shelby gt350r models ever built in 1965 and 1966 the car coming to the 2018 barrettjackson scottsdale auction lot 1425 is the most successful example of all time the first shelby gt350 mustangs were brutes in their own right their hot 289 power plants would rev freely all the while making that sweet solidlifter sound that is music to the ears of so many of us the shelby gt350r version was a brute in everyone’s right the horsepower was bumped up again from 306 to in excess of 350 just because the engine was so willing to comply the extra power also virtually ensured its credentials for serious competition the rmodel had the heart and soul of a worldclass gt car on the racetrack and was literally created expressly for the sports car club of america’s bproduction class this car’s original owner roger west took delivery of it in early 1966 and won the scca division championship that same year soon he became enthralled with ford’s gt40 program and parked the potent and soon to be famous mustang about this time charlie kemp discovered the 5r538 shelby and simply had to have it he purchased the car in 1967 from west in birmingham alabama kemp was a natural athlete and excelled in a number of sports so his talent behind the wheel of a race car was no surprise to anyone who knew him his first outing with the rmodel in montgomery alabama netted him a track record time his ability with the mustang caught the eye of enginebuilding master pete hood who would ultimately team up with kemp for a lifelong racing association hood brought the 289 to its fullest potential by extracting 430 dependable horses out of this 7000rpm race engine this duo went on to dominate bproduction throughout the ’68 and ’69 racing seasons stringing together a previously unheard of 17race winning streak in the process perhaps the car’s most notorious race was in daytona 1969 when kemp and the mustang were handling all the bproduction cars with relative ease the team decided to get daring and mix it up with the aproduction cars so kemp leaned on the little mustang even more – bringing the revs up beyond the mid7000rpm range this is when the car was clocked at 184 mph and kemp realized he was able to actually stay with some of those supposedly faster ap corvettes on the straightaways kemp referred to 5r538 as a “magical mustang” he entered the car in 54 races finished 42 times and won a total of 32 of those events when all the dust settled that gives this team a win percentage of 61 percent – an astounding ratio for any race car in any era this mustang would ultimately prove to be so intoxicating to kemp that after he sold it to try his hand at can am racing he would buy his prized mustang back and keep it for years thereafter again he teamed with hood who helped him restore the shelby to its former glory many of the original components have stayed with the car over the decades including most of the body’s sheet metal even the 32gallon fuel tank its woodtrimmed steering wheel and the cobra aluminum intake manifold with the correct holley carb remained unscathed from the adventurous life of 5r538 the dye was cast with the production of the very first pony car – the mustang it dictated the size the feel and the look of these cars for all of time countless manufacturers around the world tried to mimic this formula and most of their attempts have come and gone leaving nothing in their wake but distant memories to a great extent the mustang stands alone as the king of this market segment it is difficult to imagine a collector car more seductive than this particular shelby mustang it’s one of 36 ever made and there are less than that still in existence the car’s racing history is extraordinary and it was owned and driven by one of the most exceptional talents in the business it has even been signed twice by mr shelby himself just sitting still with its engine off this racingbred mustang is about to set another record this one will be on the fast track of ultimate desirability for uptodate information on this vehicle click here

a very viable business model so chrysler ford and general motors pulled out all the stops each trying to outdo the other to win the hearts and minds of enthusiasts that meant there were few limits on what the automakers were willing to do to win races and sell cars consider the case of the humble and utilitarian ford fairlane redesigned for 1966 the midsized fairlane was a huge hit for ford who built 317724 fairlanes during that model year an increase of 42 percent over the 1965 total the fairlane offered buyers myriad choices it was available in coupe convertible sedan and station wagon body styles with a whopping 16 different colors and a choice of powertrains but out of those 317724 fairlanes built in ’66 a mere 57 carried a description that to blue oval fanatics is nothing short of the holy grail rcode that designation meant the fairlane in question was equipped with the legendary 427ci 425horsepower ford v8 engine under the hood the 57 rcode fairlanes were built for the ultracompetitive nhra super stock drag racing circuit making them essentially factory race cars the sanctioning body required ford to produce at least 50 examples of the 427 fairlane before approving it to compete so that’s what the automaker did all 1966 rcode fairlanes were built to the same exact specs all were painted wimbledon white at the factory and all were trimmed out with black interiors and bench seats more importantly they all had the brutish 427 powerplant nicknamed “sideoiler” for its unique lubrication system a mediumriser intake manifold was topped with a pair of holley fourbarrel carburetors and spark was provided by a transistor ignition system along with the 427 came ford’s almostindestructible “toploader” 4speed manual transmission and a 9inch positraction rear end with 389 gears other features standard to all rcode ’66 fairlanes were front disc brakes radio delete dogdish hubcaps and a lightweight liftoff hood with an air scoop to provide fresh air into the hungry engine the rcode package alone nearly doubled the base price of a conventional ’66 fairlane 2door hardtop which started at a mere 2378 the rcode option added another 1725 to the price pushing it past the 4000 mark big money back in the day  which will sell at no reserve at the 2018 barrettjackson scottsdale auction is a unique example of an rcode ’66 fairlane even considering the rarity of the model this specific car has had just three owners over the last 52 years it is documented with a pair of factory build sheets and drag racing elapsedtime slips showing a best time of just 1195 seconds in the quartermile — that’s a very very quick time for half a century ago this car underwent a full rotisserie restoration in 2010 and comes with most of its original sheet metal as well of most of its original parts including the transmission rear end dualquad intake manifold exhaust manifolds heads radiator carburetorhood scoop sealing plate transistor ignition and dual air cleaner assembly included in the sale but not currently installed on the car are the dual holley carburetors and the original valve covers the original block was replaced by a correct 1968 427ci sideoiler block this 1966 ford fairlane 500 rcode represents a unique opportunity for the savvy collector most of the 57 rcode fairlanes built in 1966 were used for drag racing many were heavily modified or completely used up and discarded that means surviving examples of rcode ’66 fairlanes are exceedingly rare remember just one in every 5574 fairlanes built that year carried the rcode engine a car built in such miniscule quantities isn’t easy to find these days – and certainly not one in this combination of exquisite condition and documentation some lucky buyer is going to be very very happy when lot 1365 rolls across the auction block with no reserve at barrettjackson scottsdale for uptodate information on this vehicle click here international incident this 1966 shelby cobra was an automotive expeditionary force back in its heyday written by independent automotive journalist steve statham this 1966 shelby cobra csx3239 roadster lot 1416 is a world traveler – yet still has just over 17000 miles on its odometer shelby american’s 427 cobra was a world traveler from the beginning from its handfabricated aluminum body made by a c cars ltd in england and its appearances at racetracks worldwide to its long list of jet set owners the cobra left its tire tracks all across the globe and so it was with csx3239 a red 1966 cobra lot 1416 being offered for sale at barrettjackson’s scottsdale auction on saturday january 20 as you’d expect from a car that has survived a halfcentury of enthusiastic drivers this is a welltraveled cobra according to the ownership trail recorded in the shelby american world registry and subsequent research by more recent owners after its construction at shelby american in california the 1966 street cobra was invoiced and sent to koons ford in falls church virginia the original owner took it to central america in the late 1960s it resurfaced in 1976 and was sold out of san salvador with a 427ci holmanmoody v8 underhood and brought back to the united states it’s fun to imagine the stories from the cobra’s time in central america there’s hardly a spot on planet earth where the cobra wouldn’t have made an impact shelby’s smallblock cobras had already achieved welldeserved fame thanks to their racing victories but the arrival of the 427 cobra broke through the clutter of 1960s performance cars to become an instant legend the bigblock cobra was pure overkill in the best sense—the classic formula of biggest engine in the smallest lightest car all wrapped in irresistible sheet metal the first 427 cobras had been introduced in 1965 as racing models with some later converted to sc “semicompetition” status but 1966 saw the release of genuine street models shelby american gave some bold performance numbers in the company’s press release announcing the new 427 cobra including being able to run from a dead stop to 100 mph and back to a dead stop in a fraction over 14 seconds and 060 mph bursts in 397 seconds the shape of the new aluminum body was familiar to anyone who knew cars yet was wider more aggressive than the original cobra under the skin was a new tubular chassis and a fresh suspension that saw coil springs replacing the 289 cobra’s leaf springs larger brakes front and rear helped reel in the 427 cobra from speed the whole package weighed roughly 2400 to 2500 pounds which gave a breathtaking powertoweight ratio the 427ci bigblock ford fe engine breathing through dual holley 600 cfm 4barrel carburetors generated 425 horsepower and 480 ftlbs of torque some 1966 cobras such as csx3239 were fitted with 428 police interceptor v8s when shelby ran into supply issues trying to secure enough 427s from ford motor company but either way the pairing of bigblock ford v8 with lightweight aluminum body was a combination that had no match motor magazine tested a 427 cobra in 1967 and recorded a 060 time of 42 seconds and a 124second quarter mile “all right so some dragsters can do it quicker but is there another road car in the world to beat these figures i doubt it” wrote motor’s roger bell “the distressing thing is that we are now deprived of looking forward to anything better in the foreseeable future at least not on acceleration” along the way the ownership trail indicates this cobra was used as intended for sporting motoring although the mileage was kept low – the car currently shows just over 17000 miles the car was born with red paint and black interior but lived a life more interesting than most – at various times it has worn custom side pipes white stripes had the holmanmoody 427 v8 been vintageraced and featured in muscle car milestones magazine like almost all 427 cobras it has a 4speed ford toploader transmission in 2006 it was restored and equipped to run the copperstate 1000 vintage car road rally the current owner purchased the cobra in 2014 and the roll bar competition gas filler side pipes and hood scoop were removed the cobra was sent to an aluminum fabrication and paint specialist to give the car a complete refinish over an excellent original aluminum body “its magnificent presentation immaculate preparation and solid originality make this a desirable 427 cobra with excellent documentation” the seller states that’s a truth that would be recognized all over the world for uptodate information on this vehicle click here chevrolets to

oldsmobile fiesta lot 13532 and chevrolet corvette lot 13533 – all selling at no reserve at the 2018 scottsdale auction the american auto industry after world war ii reflected both the unflappable optimism of our nation’s population and the enormous capabilities of the manufacturing sector there was no dream too big too audacious or too challenging to tackle it was time for the greatest generation to take their talent and their ambition and use it to launch a huge postwar expansion to take the country to the next level nowhere did that optimism manifest itself more visibly than in detroit where the big three automakers began producing dazzling dream cars to wow the public with what they could do general motors the nation’s largest automaker created a traveling show called motorama a showcase of highend dream vehicles for the public to view along with entertainment to further impress the crowd the first gm motorama in 1953 opened at the waldorfastoria in new york where on the first day it drew 45000 visitors who took in the fleet of cars along with singers dancers and a full orchestra by the time the ’53 motorama show had travelled the country more than 14 million people from sea to shining sea had visited the exhibit to see what gm had created the stars of the motorama shows were the cars of course and gm decided to go big with its vision for 1953 creating four show cars produced in limited numbers that the public could purchase all four were what today would be called “halo cars” – topoftheline creations that represented the best each brand had to offer all four were convertibles too three luxury cars and the debut of what would become america’s most iconic – and longlasting – performance car at this year’s barrettjackson scottsdale auction bidders will have the opportunity to acquire examples of each of the 1953 motorama cars all from the wellknown de atley collection all selling with no reserve on saturday january 20 and all restored to showcar levels of quality lot 1353 – 1953 buick skylark convertible lot 1353 1953 buick skylark of all the gm motorama cars the skylark was the most successful at least in terms of units sold buick managed to sell 1690 1953 skylarks which is a total greater than the other three gm motorama cars combined this despite the skylark carrying a 5000 price tag which represented a 43percent premium over buick’s stillritzy roadmaster convertible that said it’s easy to see why the skylark sold for top dollar largely handmade the skylark was elegant and fashionable with several distinguishing characteristics including its “sweepspear” chrome side trim that ran virtually the length of the car and a lower beltline as well as the kelseyhayes chromed wire wheels mechanically the skylark had a lot going on too as 1953 marked the first year of the 322ci buick fireball v8 also known as the “nailhead” and the 12volt electronics lot 1353 features a stunning color combination the exterior is matador red one of seven colors offered on this model while the interior is helsinki red over white gorgeous simply gorgeous lot  13531 – 1953 cadillac eldorado convertible lot 13531 1953 cadillac eldorado among the 1953 motorama cars the cadillac eldorado was the best of the best the very topoftheline offering from general motors it was also the priciest carrying a window sticker of 7750 about 72000 in today’s dollars and a whopping 3000 more than a 1953 cadillac series 62 convertible little wonder that gm sold just 532 examples of the firstyear eldorado discerning buyers found a lot to like in the new cadillac model gm design chief harley earl and his team made significant changes with the eldorado which was longer and lower than the series 62 with cutdown doors and a wraparound panoramic windshield wire wheels were standard as was a flush metal cover to conceal the top when it was folded the name eldorado is derived from the spanish phrase el dorado which means “the gilded one” with the interior made from the finest leather and all manner of comfort and convenience features this was indeed the gilded one of the automotive world for 1953 the cadillac eldorado was offered in just four color choices lot 13531 is trimmed out in alpine white over a blackandwhite interior – one of the most iconic color schemes of the 1950s and it looks great on this fabulous restoration and a little piece of trivia for you dwight eisenhower rode in a 1953 cadillac eldorado on the way to his presidential inauguration lot  13532 – 1953 oldsmobile fiesta convertible lot 13532 1953 oldsmobile fiesta oldsmobile built just 458 fiesta convertibles in 1953 making it the secondrarest of the four motorama cars ahead of only the corvette which had only 300 examples produced at 5715 the fiesta cost about the same amount as an oldsmobile super 88 convertible and a basemodel 88 coupe combined interestingly 1953 turned out to be the only year the fiesta was built making it a rare bird indeed the most unique styling feature of the fiesta was the hockeystickshaped side trim which separated a variety of twotone paint schemes that were so popular back in the day the wraparound panoramic windshield was a full 3 inches lower than the windshields on lesser ’53 olds ragtops giving the fiesta a sportier appearance like the other motorama big cars the fiesta was loaded with standard equipment including power top windows and seats and an automatic headlight dimming system known as the “autronic eye” under the hood the fiesta was equipped with the legendary rocket 88 v8 engine which produced 170 horsepower five more horses than any other olds model that year lot 13532 features one of the fiesta’s best twotone paint schemes raven red over polar white with a matching twotone interior it is a stunning car with many nos parts lot 13533 – 1953 chevrolet corvette 235150 convertible lot 13533 1953 chevrolet corvette this is where an american legend began lot 13533 is the 30th of 300 corvettes produced in 1953 the first model year for arguably the greatest twoseat sports car ever built in this country all 300 1953 corvettes were built to the same basic specs polo white paint on a fiberglass body red interior black softtop a 235ci 150horsepower engine and a twospeed powerglide automatic transmission heaters and am radios were also standard interestingly of all the four motorama cars the corvette is the only one that’s remained in mostly continuous production ever since there was no 1983 corvette but in every other year since 1953 it’s been one of chevrolet’s offerings lot 13533 carries important corvette documentation with it the national corvette restorers society ncrs has awarded this car “top flight” status which means achieved 94 percent or above of 4500 available points to in a rigorous judging process of operations check exterior interior mechanical and chassis judging it is also won the ncrs duntov mark of excellence award which is an even higher and rarer honor so while all 1953 corvettes were built the same not all were restored the same lot 13533 is among the very finest examples around and it has the paperwork to prove it the de atley collection put simply the de atley collection of motorama vehicles features four exceptional automobiles from one of the most significant periods in the history of the american automotive

intricate framework of the jetliners that take many of us on weekly business trips aluminum’s combination of low mass and high strength makes it an ideal raw material for a multitude of purposes in the case of the superbly restored 1969 zl1 camaro lot 1409 to be offered at the 2018 barrettjackson collector car event in scottsdale arizona on saturday january 20 aluminum plays a huge role in setting it apart from the 243000plus other camaros built that year this is the 59th of a mere 69 cars built with copo central office production order 9560 the aluminum zl1 427 bigblock engine option it’s also the only one of the 69car production run built with the nc8 chambered dualexhaust system an upgrade over the restrictive crossflow canister muffler used on the 68 others restored with its correct hugger orange hue and equipped with a correct muncie m22 rockcrusher 4speed manual transmission and 410 ratio 12bolt rear axle it is the epitome of camaro high performance don’t confuse this copo 9560 zl1 with the more common copo 9561 427 camaro also offered in 1969 though highly soughtafter the 9561 used the lessexotic 425horsepower l72 427 as offered in certain fullsize chevy passenger cars and toppowered 1966 stingrays the copo 9560 zl1 was so much more beyond the lighterweight castaluminum engine block and cylinder heads inside the zl1 had bumped compression and included an even wilder mechanical cam chevrolet coyly rated the zl1 at just 430 horsepower at least 100 below its actual capability but not so much to attract unwanted scrutiny from insurance agents or the nhra which factored engines based on advertised horsepower along with two corvettes the fleet of 69 camaros were the only zl1powered chevrolets ever built and while the corvette installations were targeted at road racing chevrolet had nhra stock super stock and factory experimental class drag racing in mind with the lightweight camaro carrying the weight of a small block but producing over 500 horsepower before modifications the zl1 was an instant standout at the hands of racers like bill “grumpy” jenkins dick harrell lamar walden and others if demand for 396 bigblock camaros was any indicator 37310 were sold from 196769 the zl1 should have been a very popular machine but while chevrolet initially predicted a 400 option charge the actual number turned out to be 4160 and that was in addition to the purchase price of the host camaro when all was said and done a typical zl1 window sticker broke the 7000 mark for some context at the same time cadillac charged 6711 for a loaded eldorado gm’s ultimate status symbol of the day one dealer fred gibb chevrolet of la harpe illinois was so awestruck by the zl1 it placed a 30car order gibb must have had nerves of steel the batch cost him 216000 – not including tax try as they might gibb’s salesmen only managed to retail 13 of the 7200 supercars as 1969 came to a close facing ruin gibb persuaded chevrolet to disburse the unsold units to other dealers admittedly it’s hard to imagine any zl1 camaro going unwanted but time heals all wounds today a verified zl1 camaro like this one is highly soughtafter be smart and bid aggressively

copper brightwork and canework make this 1937 rollsroyce phantom iii sedanca de ville by freestone  webb one of a kind watch for it in the salon collection at the 2018 barrettjackson scottsdale auction most flamboyant automobiles have a fascinating creation story and such is the case with the rollsroyce phantom iii in barrettjackson’s 2018 salon collection which will be crossing the auction block on saturday january 20 the phantom iii was the last of the large prewar rollsroyces and its aluminum alloy twin plug motor was the only v12 produced by the company until 1998 displacing 447ci and producing 165 horsepower a total of 727 phantom iii chassis were produced from 1936 to 1939 each of these were clothed with bespoke coachwork to the customer’s taste meaning no two were alike this car chassis 3cp38 was ordered in 1937 with a formal limousine body built by the obscure english coachbuilder w c atcherley like many great prewar cars 3cp38 spent the war years in storage it was purchased in october 1945 by entrepreneur alfred john gaul under whose ownership it experienced a rebirth the likes of which the motoring world had never seen gaul a successful secondhand car dealer before and after the war managed to parlay a small fortune into an enviable collection of real estate holdings in several countries a flamboyant man of the era he lavished attention on a number of exceptional automobiles including a half dozen rollsroyces several of his cars were bodied by saoutchik including a fabulous delahaye 175 in early 1946 3cp38 was entrusted to freestone  webb to design and construct new coachwork their bread was buttered by the production of bodies on rollsroyce and bentley chassis and they were responsible for popularizing the “razoredge” style gaul’s directive was according to his stepson to produce a body that could “win at any concours d’elegance” this car was freestone  webb’s first postwar rollsroyce commission and the potential for this firm which had lain dormant during the war to stimulate more business for itself certainly conveyed pressure on the designers work was completed in august 1946 and the car received the registration number foy 1 which it still wears today and how impressive it was a review in the english publication the autocar from september 27 1946 described the phantom iii as having “very striking lines which fall gradually from the scuttle towards the rear giving a very lowbuilt appearance the paneling displays sharp edges also reproduced in the long sweeping wings which with the running boards are in burnished solid copper with a satin finish in combination with the deep chianti red paintwork the copper makes a striking finish for the radiator mouldings lamps bumpers and other metal work are also copperplated” the resulting sedanca de ville wowed audiences with its use of brightwork in copper rather than chrome on every bit of trim and hardware canework on the rear doors and the razoredge styling that was freestone  webb’s hallmark the interior was equally spectacular appointed with an electrically operated division window folding tables heater radio bar and clock in the rear compartment gaul showed his fabulous rolls at concours d’elegance in paris deauville and monte carlo where it won the grand prix a number of photos exist of the car at various concours events in 1954 the rolls was sold to an l zimbler in the uk then to an owner in south africa and later made its way to the netherlands it was prominently featured in the fall 1963 issue of the classic car possibly portending its arrival in the united states in 1966 it was owned in the mid1970s by robert miller and later richard sinicki of pittsburg pennsylvania in whose ownership the car remained unseen for many years though some knew of its existence no one knew its whereabouts until the early 2000s when it was acquired by don williams of the blackhawk collection who entrusted it to the wellknown restorer mike fennel for a full restoration to concours standards the commitment to a car of this status was not insignificant by any means and restoring 3cp38 the right way – mainly in terms of getting the copper finish right – took over five years bob lorkowski was entrusted to rebuild the v12 motor and phantom iii guru mark tuttle was one of the several specialists consulted regarding technical details and of course the painstaking work of applying the finishes on the copper trim correctly all pieces were restored true to form with engine turning on the sides of the fenders and brushed surfaces elsewhere williams debuted the rolls at the 2008 pebble beach concours d’elegance where it was awarded first in class rollsroyce prewar and was recipient of the lucius beebe trophy awarded to the rollsroyce considered most in the tradition of lucius beebe a bon vivant who served among the concours’ early judges its rich history is documented by copies of the original rollsroyce build sheets many period photographs

’cuda written by independent automotive journalist steve magnante the last known hemi ‘cuda ever built this 1971 metallic true blue beauty lot 1411 is headed to the 2018 scottsdale auction imagine it you’re behind the wheel with your left foot holding the clutch pedal against the carpet in your right hand the pistolgrip shift handle snicks into first gear as your right foot steadies the tach at 3000 rpm the shaker air scoop quivers … whatever happens next is entirely up to you now imagine that wheel belongs to a beautifully restored metallic true blue 1971 hemi ’cuda lot 1411 that is one of only 59 4speeds built in the hemi ’cuda’s final year and – even more impressive – it’s the last known hemi ’cuda known to have rolled off chrysler’s hamtramck michigan assembly line until another 1971 hemi ’cuda appears with a higher vin this true blue unit headed for the barrettjackson scottsdale auction on saturday january 20 seems to represent the end of the plymouth ebody “elephant” dynasty it’s no secret 426 hemipowered mopars are one of the musclecar era’s most hardcore street machines revisionist history aside owners of gtos cobra jets gran sports ss 396 chevelles and 442s knew they were outgunned when these cars were factorynew and in optimum tune in fact it could be said it’s because of the street hemi that aftermarket merchants made fortunes bolstering brandx muscle cars into a more competitive state of tune no matter what brand you like best you have to applaud what chrysler corporation pulled off with the street hemi program it took a lot of guts to flood main street usa with over 9000 slightly detuned nascar race engines but that’s exactly what the 196671 street hemi was and nearly 50 years later we’re still raving about them – and collectors are paying record sums for the privilege of ownership while the resulting 425 horsepower 490 ftlbs pachyderm was mostly offered in midsize bbody road runners gtxs chargers and super bees the “king kong hemi” makes its best moves aboard the smaller 197071 ebody ’cuda which was over a foot shorter and up to 200 pounds lighter if you want the ultimate tigerbythetail mopar driving experience the hemi ’cuda is your car fully inspected and verified by a prominent mopar historian this beautifully restored ’71 still has most of its factory sheet metal and a cherry on top is the presence of the original broadcast sheet this delicate paper item is all too often missing or destroyed from years of sitting in the damp confines between carpet and floor going further this example was originally built with a little something called the super track pack along with adding power front disc brakes it replaced the dana’s standardissue gear set with something more aggressive suffice it to say that sticky drag slicks and a prepared racing surface are required to fully harness the power of this beast compared to typical hemi ’cudas on the show circuit this one might seem a bit spartan remember though that a lot of the “bells and whistles” commonly seen on restored examples were all extracost factory options judging from the 4speed and 410 dana seen on our feature ’cuda we’d bet the original buyer wanted a lowprofile sleeper all the better to lure unsuspecting mustangs camaros and goats the lack of these visual goodies might also have been calculated to put traffic police – and auto insurance providers – off the scent of the mighty hemi lurking under hood for these reasons less can be more the odometer says this ’cuda has covered just over 23000 miles if even a fraction were of the quartermileatatime variety the preservation of the original drivetrain speaks well of the skills – and sense – of the fortunate drivers who’ve peered past the shaker scoop over the years any one of them could have missed an aggressive power shift triggering valve float pistontovalvecontact a detached valve head a hole in the cylinder wall and a replacement engine block but no – the presence of the matchingnumbers engine transmission and rear axle tells us they had the skills all you have to do now to turn imagination into reality is raise your hand and bid on this beauty of a 4speed – you can pretend you’re ronnie sox dick landy or both when you’re putting this special ’cuda through its paces though just remember it still carries its matchingnumbers engine and transmission play it safe and smart or maybe use a mopar performance hemi crate engine for when you want to have fun the hemi experience just doesn’t get much better than this for uptodate information on this vehicle click here luxurious lago oneoff talbotlago t26 grand sport coupe joins the 2018 salon collection written by independent automotive journalist jonathan sierakowski one of the stars of the 2018 salon collection at the barrettjackson scottsdale auction in january will be this 1951 talbotlago t26 grand sport saoutchik coupe talbotlago owed much of its success to major anthony lago who energized the company with race victories prior to the outbreak of world war ii in 1939 with the increase in displacement of the triplecarbureted racederived prewar engine to 45liter capacity which was mated to a wilson preselector gearbox talbotlago was considered by many to be the first highperformance luxury car built after the cessation of hostilities the topoftheline grand sport model was developed during the war and featured an engine upgraded with dual overhead valves aluminum heads and a variety of performance modifications that produced a potent 190 horsepower and boasted a top speed of up to 200 kilometers 124 miles per hour depending on the type of coachwork each of the ultraexclusive t26 grand sports was fitted with a custom body by one of several coachbuilders among the names represented were franay figoni stabilimenti farina and saoutchik the t26 grand sport was initially introduced on a 265centimeter 104inch chassis a mere 29 of these were produced in the book “jacques saoutchik – maître carrossier” marque historian peter larsen writes “since the launch of the 265 cm wheelbase chassis in 1947 there had been some rumblings that its extreme shortness in relation to its height the physical size of the engine its 18inch wheels as well as the need for a 120liter fuel tank made it difficult for the carrossiers to achieve aesthetically pleasing shapes” lago eventually responded with the introduction of a longer 280centimeter 110inch chassis in 1951 although the production record is unclear it is even more miniscule than the shortwheelbase chassis with between four and six actually built and only three surviving a stunning member of the 2018 salon collection at the barrettjackson scottsdale auction chassis 110156 is considered to be the second of the long chassis although several grand sports were bodied by carrosserie saoutchik this example is a oneoff the advantages of the longer wheelbase are immediately evident when viewing the side profile with its long louvered hood that eventually gives way to the cabin placed far back on the chassis chrome tastefully adorns the exterior from the buickinspired waterfall grille to the chrome moldings atop the fenders an additional chrome spear runs the length of the hood from the top of the grille to the base of the windshield and another runs along the side of the body gently sweeping upward past the quarterwindows plenty of visibility is allowed between the side and quarterwindows which meet without the visual interference of a bpillar of course no touring coupe would be complete without a sunroof to let in additional light and fresh air when so desired the notchback styling of the rear of the body flows into the rear end with a long trunk that gracefully tapers down to the rear bumper and further harmony is provided by the appearance of the skirted rear fenders delivered to its wellheeled customer in march 1951 known history picks up in the early 1980s when it was owned by maurice harlaux a colonel of the belgian army living in brussels who also owned t26 grand sport 110155 although it had been cosmetically refurbished at some point 101156 had never been comprehensively restored until 1983 when it came into the possession of jacques “frenchy” harguindeguy a wellknown collector from walnut creek california harguindeguy had an enviable collection of coachbuilt french cars among them the 2000 pebble beach best of showwinning 1937 delahaye roadster frenchy restored the grand sport in its current livery in time to be shown at the 1984 pebble beach concours displayed in an extremely competitive talbotlago class that included nine cars records show that 110156 came out on top with first in class honors from there the car passed to don williams of the blackhawk collection and later erich traber of switzerland who retained it for 17 years the talbot rejoined the blackhawk collection in 2006 where it has remained since still wearing the awardwinning harguindeguy restoration the striking red and black exterior is matched by the leather upholstery in the spacious cabin fabulous extraordinary spectacular – these words represent the genius of anthony lago and jacques saoutchik while their desire to produce their handbuilt creations without compromise is embodied in this talbotlago grand sport for uptodate information on this vehicle click here coachbuilder spotlight jacques saoutchik the earliest known photo of carosserie saoutchik 1907 the car is a berliet 22cv a cabinetmaker by trade by 1905 jacques saoutchik had graduated to the art of coachbuilding and refined his craft throughout the belle epoque and the classic era early advertisements show the firm branded themselves with taglines like “carrosserie de luxe” and “le carrossier en vogue” more than just advertising the firm ultimately lived up to the image it cultivated with the utilization of highquality materials and craftsmanship saoutchik created amazing and innovative coachwork that graced all of the best chassis available including rollsroyce talbotlago hispanosuiza bugatti mercedesbenz pegaso and delahaye the chassis of over 50 different marques bore saoutchik badging jacques saoutchik at work in the 1920s while many products of the neuillysurseine firm were fine formal bodies the most rakish and celebrated examples of their work were the coupes and roadsters wellproportioned and incorporating features like disappearing tops exotic leathers chrome or nickel trim ranging from ornate to flamboyant the best examples of saoutchik’s artistry rank among the most desirable and valuable coachbuilt automobiles today only a relative handful of the prewar coachbuilders survived the doldrums of the great depression and world war ii many only did so by taking on repair work or diversifying beyond the automobile trade saoutchik was one of the survivors and amazingly they managed to stay afloat solely from producing coachwork postwar commissions flowed once again from delahaye talbotlago and the newlyformed pegaso and the results of their efforts rivaled some of their prewar accomplishments however times had changed for good and the era of the custom coachbuilder was coming to a close a decline in orders resulted in the company being placed in receivership in 1951 and operations ceased at the end of 1954 preview of barrettjackson 2018

2018 scottsdale auction truly a horse of a different color 1966 shelby gt350 prototype 001 written by independent automotive journalist scott black the very first 1966 shelby gt350 lot 1406 ever built is headed to the 2018 barrettjackson scottsdale auction one of the most iconic cars in automotive history is the ford shelby gt350 launched in january 1965 alongside the new bigblock cobra the pony car was an instant star conceived to homologate the ford mustang for scca competition carroll shelby’s 1965 gt350 exemplified the blue oval’s “total performance” mantra by conferring an unbeatable image on the trendsetting pony car drivers like ken miles ruled the racetrack with the shelby gt350 that year racking up championships nationwide the gt350 was part of the wave of vehicles from shelby that pushed the performance envelope during that period from revolutionary aerodynamic coupes to experimental electronic fuelinjection systems and bleedingedge styling cues the california hotrodders always wanted to seek a competitive advantage sadly many of those innovations were on cars that disappeared into history or were crushed one that did make it into private hands chassis sfm6s001 lot 1406 will be sold on saturday january 20 during the 2018 barrettjackson scottsdale auction a rare prototype while all surviving gt350s are special sfm6s001 is particularly important according to the shelby american world registry this car was the preproduction prototype and very first shelby gt350 built for 1966 it was built so that ford and shelby could smooth out some of the production items that cropped up for the first model year of the car sfm6s001 was the primary test car for the 1966 gt350 development program it was also used to evaluate a vinyl roof treatment which was ultimately not released for sale this gt350 was exhibited by shelby american at various events and depicted in marketing brochures for that model year like all 1966 model year shelby gt350s the prototype is powered by a matchingnumbers highperformance 289ci v8 engine and 4speed t10 manual transmission however it also has many unusual features that set it apart from any other shelby of the period unlike regular production versions sfm6s001 was not a “delete” car from ford that was later upgraded to gt350 spec by shelby american rather it began life as a factorystandard wimbledon white kcode highperformance 1965 fastback with all factorystandard features remaining on the car before being converted into a gt350 shelby craftsmen welded the export brace brackets and filled holes in the body panels where the standard mustang emblems and moldings would have been serious collectors will take note of the uniqueness of this car truly a one of one in addition sfm6s001 is the only shelby gt350 to have been originally equipped with the upscale factoryoptional pony upholstery option offered for production mustangs other fascinating features include aluminum inside rearquarter window trim and the fittings for the rearbrake cooling ductwork during the last two or three weeks at shelby american sfm6s001 was sent to acme auto headlining in long beach california for fitment of a medium blue vinyl top shelby briefly considered this as a potential factoryavailable option for 1966 similar to the incoming mercury cougar but ultimately rejected the idea authentic again over the years sfm6s001 changed hands a few times subsequent owners modified the car and somewhere along the way the shelby lost its original vinyl top and gained some nonoriginal equipment in 2011 a complete restoration was commissioned to asnew original delivery condition including the installation of a correct blue vinyl top the completed car earned the gold award in division ii judging at the midamerica ford and shelby nationals and first place in its class during saac 27 sfm6s001 was invited to be displayed at the 2015 pebble beach concours d’elegance –the first time any shelby mustang was shown at the famous event correctly restored and simply fascinating this shelby is an exemplary oneoff example with tremendous historical significance and with its unusual cosmetics sfm6s001 is definitely a horse
