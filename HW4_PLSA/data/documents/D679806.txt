balm 1 lilac chastetree 2 or monks pepper is a native of the mediterranean region it is one of the few temperatezone species of vitex which is on the whole a genus of tropical and subtropical flowering plants 3 theophrastus mentioned the shrub several times as agnos άγνος in enquiry into plants it has been long believed to be an anaphrodisiac – leading to its name as chaste tree – but its effectiveness for such action remains unproven vitex is a crosspollinating plant but its selfpollination has been recorded 4contents  hide 1 etymology and common names2 description21 reproduction22

name in pliny the elder is derived from the latin vieo meaning to weave or to tie up a reference to the use of vitex agnuscastus in basketry 5 its macaronic specific name repeats  chaste  in both greek and latin the small tree was considered to be sacred to the virginal goddess hestia  vesta the most common names are chaste tree vitex and monks pepper 6description  editclose up of vitexagnuscastusflowers with carpenter bee xylocopa sp vitex agnuscastus is widely cultivated in warm temperate and subtropical regions for its delicatetextured aromatic foliage and butterfly attracting midsummer spikes of lavender flowers opening in late summer in cooler climates 7 it grows to a height of 1–5 meters it requires full sun though tolerating partial shade along with welldrained soil under ideal conditions it is hardy to 10 degrees f usda zone 6 and can be found as far north as the south shore of long island and nantucket on the east coast of north america and in the mild southwest of england 8 in colder zones such as around st louis mo the plant tends to die back to the ground but as it flowers on new wood flowering not affected on vigorous growth in the following season 9 this plant is a brackish water dweller indicating that it tolerates salt cold and wet weather results in dieback and losses the plant grows well on loamy neutral to alkaline soil 4the monks pepper fruits from one single tree can be harvested for more than 15 years this indicates that the monks pepper cannot be integrated in a usual crop rotation system 4 10 it is suggested to sow dissimilar plants such as monocots as its subsequent crop so that it might be easier to control the monks pepper plant the dicot because the fruits of monks pepper tend to fall constantly and uncontrollably it is likely that the plant can germinate from seed 4 it is said that at a row spacing of 180 cm the overall best yield per hectare can be achieved if the plant spacing is around 70 cm 4 pruning back the branches in autumn has a positive influence on fruit yield while a repruning in spring can induce an increase of vegetative shoot and thus to fruit yield loss 4reproduction  editthis plant can also be reproduced vegetatively one possibility is to use 5–8 cm long piece of the ripening wood with buds in july or august and another is to cut the ripe wood in november and then let it root in a coldframe 4 also in vitro reproduction with spike of the shoots or node explants is possible 11harvest  editthe flowering and ripening processes do not happen simultaneously enabling harvesting of both fresh fruits and seeds over a long span of time the fruits tend to fall from the plant as they ripen getting lost in the soil thus there is no optimal fixed harvest time consequently to avoid yield loss unripe fruits need to be harvested this early harvesting has no effect on quality 4 overall it is said that harvesting the fruits by hand is the most convenient solution 10diseases and pests  editthysanoptera also known as thrips can cause great damage to the growth and the generative development of vitex agnuscastus 12 the insect feeds on chaste tree by sucking up the contents or puncturing them as well chaste tree is the only known host especially in israel for hyalesthus obsoletus this cicada is the vector for black wood disease of grapevines hyalesthus obsoletus prefers v agnuscastus as a host to the grapevine in this case chaste tree can be used as a biological control agent by planting it around vineyards to trap the hyalesthus obsoletus 13 v agnuscastus was found not only to be an appropriate food source for the adult vectors but also a reservoir of candidatus phytoplasma solani bacterial phytoplasma species the causal agent of the black wood disease in grapevines 14 the pathogencaused leaf spot disease can almost defoliate v agnus castus furthermore root rot can occur when soils are kept too moist 15chemical compounds  editflavonoids  vitexin casticin  iridoid glycoside  agnuside aucubin phydroxybenzoic acid 6 16 alkaloids essential oils fatty oils diterpenoids and steroids have been identified in the chemical analysis of vitex agnuscastus 17 they occur in the fruits and in the leaves 16essential oils  editessential oils have been found in the fruits and in the leaves the oil of leaves unripe and ripe fruits differ in compounds 50 compounds were identified in the oil of unripe fruits 51 compounds in the oil of ripe fruits and 46 compounds in the oil of the leaves 18cineole and sabinene are the main monoterpene components and betacaryophyllene is the major sesquiterpene compound found in the fruits of vitex agnuscastus there are some slight differences between fruits from white flowering plants and such from violet flowering ones the oil of fruits of white flowering plants have a higher amount of monoterpene constituents the leaves mainly contain 18cineole transbetafarnesene alphapinene transbetacaryophyllene and terpinen4ol the oil particularly from white flowering plants is under preliminary research for its potential antibacterial effects 18herbal uses  editthe leaves and tender stem growth of the upper 10 cm 39 in along with the flowers and ripening seeds are harvested for alternative medicinal purposes it is believed the berries are a tonic herb for both the male and female reproductive systems the leaves are believed to have the same effect but to a lesser degree 19 20 the leaves flowers andor berries may be consumed as a decoction traditional tincture cider
