amounts in men who have prostate cancer or other diseases the highest levels of acid phosphatase are found in metastasized prostate cancer diseases of the bone such as pagets disease or hyperparathyroidism diseases of blood cells such as sicklecell disease or multiple myeloma or lysosomal storage diseases such as gauchers disease will show moderately increased levels certain medications can cause temporary increases or decreases in acid phosphatase levels manipulation of the prostate gland through massage biopsy or rectal exam before a test may increase the level its physiological function may be associated with the liquefaction process of semen 5contents  hide 1 use in prostatic cancer prognosis11 serum marker12 immunohistochemistry2 hiv3 pain suppression4 history5 see also6 references7 further reading8 external links use in prostatic cancer prognosis  editserum marker  editpsap was used to monitor and assess progression of prostate cancer until the introduction of prostate specific antigen psa which has now largely displaced it subsequent work suggested that it has a role in prognosticating intermediate and highrisk prostate cancer and led to renewed interest in it as a biomarker 6immunohistochemistry  editpsap immunohistochemical staining is often used with psa staining by pathologists to help distinguish poorly differentiated carcinomas for example poorly differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma  prostate cancer and urothelial carcinoma  bladder cancer may appear similar under the microscope but psap and psa staining can help differentiate them 7 prostate adenocarcinoma often stains with psa andor psap while urothelial carcinoma does not hiv  editpap may play an important role in the transmission of hiv researchers at the university of ulm in germany found that pap forms fibers made of amyloid they called the fibers semenderived enhancer of virus infection sevi and showed that they capture hiv virions promoting their attachment to target cells the association of pap with hiv may increase the ability of the virus to infect human cells by several orders of magnitude pap may be a future target of efforts to combat the spread of hiv infection 8pain suppression  edita study at the university of north carolina and university of helsinki suggested that pap could have potent antinociceptive antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects that last longer than morphine one dose of pap lasted for up to three days much longer than the five hours gained with a single dose of morphine when in distress nerve cells release a chemical known as adenosine triphosphate atp which in turn invokes a painful sensation atp is broken down into amp which pap converts into adenosine a molecule known to suppress pain 9
