vodka alcoholic beverages liquor and spirits alcohol consumption alcohol beverages what percentage of alcohol is needed in vodka for it to burn5 answers meir lipnick long time moderate drinker of alcohol answered oct 5 2014 · author has 988 answers and 11m answer views in the us we use a measure for alcohol called alcohol proof 200 proof is pure alcohol and 100 proof is 50 the reason this measurement system exists is because 100 proof is the minimum level where the liquid is flammable so 50 is the minimum edit a little more research and i came across this five scientifically surprising facts about booze alcohol can catch fire at any time ever wondered what proof alcohol must be for it to catch fire of course you have you pyro in ye olde days whiskey was tested for authenticity and alcohol content by pouring some over a small amount of gun powder if the whiskey burned off and the powder ignited it was considered proof that meant approximately 100 proof 495 percent rounded up but now we know a number of factors change the flash point—when the alcohol will ignite not necessarily burn steadily its not really the liquid burning its the vapors that catch fire higher proof equals more vapor depending on temperature hold a match to 80 proof vodka at room temperature and it wont catch fire hold a lighters flame or a butane torch to it though and it will ignite temporarily this is because lighters flame is heating the booze a little and thus generating more vapor if you carefully heat the vodka to a higher temperature it produces a lot of vapor and it can catch fire and burn energetically note do not try to do this you can definitely accidentally blow yourself up this scales down to lowproof solutions for instance in cooking if you add wine to a hot pan it will flame up spectacularly despite being only about 12 percent abv 24 proof conversely even 100 percent pure ethanol will not ignite if the liquid is 55 degrees f or lower546k views · view upvoters your response

contains 40 abv alcohol by volume will catch fire if heated to about 26 °c 79 °f and if an ignition source is applied to it this is called its flash point the flash point of pure ethanol is 1660 °c

alcohol by volume spirits will usually burn at room temperature or slightly above trust me i’ve lit more sambuccas than i care to admit back when i was tending bar if the liquor is too cold you’ll have to heat it up slightly 3640 cognac will ignite when poured over hot food first for example that’s used in flambéing if you heat it enough pretty much any concentration will burn boiling port will ignite on a gas burner for instance often on its own but every time if you give it a little nudge towards the flame done that more often than i care to admit to hasten the preparation of port

noise because of rounding on wikipedias original figures so the constants are more precise than they are accurate flash point in °c  17188  alcohol by volume0456 for example 05  0456  1372 1372  17188

addition to the previous answers the air concentration of the ethanol vapour is also important as to whether it will burn when the air concentration of alcohol vapour drops below 3 there is insufficient fuel for it to ignite hence low percentage alcoholic drinks will not burn you can’t flambe with beer for example and for this reason only about 30 of the alcohol content of high proof liquor will burn off when flamed in a pan before the air concentration has dropped below the lower flammability limit52k views related questions how is vodka distilled what is the percentage of
