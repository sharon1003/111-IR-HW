from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search sarcopenia classification and external resources icd  10 m628  edit on wikidatasarcopenia is the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass 05–1 loss per year after the age of 50 quality and strength associated with aging 1 sarcopenia is a component of the frailty syndrome it is often a component of cachexia it can also exist independently of cachexia whereas cachexia includes malaise and is secondary to an underlying pathosis such as cancer sarcopenia may occur in healthy people and does not necessarily include malaise the term is from

icd10 classifies sarcopenia to code m6284 2 this is an enhancement over the base icd10 classification which only uses the 5th character position within chapter xvii to identify the anatomical site of occurrence  citation neededthe european working group on sarcopenia in older people ewgsop developed a clinical definition and consensus diagnostic criteria for agerelated sarcopenia using the presence of low muscle mass and either low muscular strength or low physical performance 3 severe sarcopenia requires the presence of all three conditions 3signs and symptoms  editsarcopenia is characterized first by a muscle atrophy a decrease in the size of the muscle along with a reduction in muscle tissue quality characterized by such factors as replacement of muscle fibres with fat an increase in fibrosis changes in muscle metabolism oxidative stress and degeneration of the neuromuscular junction and leading to progressive loss of muscle function and frailty 4 sarcopenia is determined by two factors initial amount of muscle mass and rate at which aging decreases muscle mass due to the loss of independence associated with loss of muscle strength the threshold at which muscle wasting becomes a disease is different pathologically from person to person 5simple circumference measurement does not provide enough data to determine whether or not an individual is suffering from severe sarcopenia sarcopenia is also marked by a decrease in the circumference of distinct types of muscle fibers skeletal muscle has different fibertypes which are characterized by expression of distinct myosin variants during sarcopenia there is a decrease in type 2 fiber circumference  type ii  with little to no decrease in type i fiber circumference  type i  and deinervated type 2 fibers are often converted to type 1 fibers by reinnervation by slow type 1 fiber motor nerves 6causes  editsatellite cells are small mononuclear cells that abut the muscle fiber satellite cells are normally activated upon injury or exercise these cells then differentiate and fuse into the muscle fiber helping to maintain its function one theory is that sarcopenia is in part caused by a failure in satellite cell activation 4extreme muscle loss is often a result of both diminishing anabolic signals such as growth hormone and testosterone and promotion of catabolic signals such as proinflammatory cytokines 4oxidized proteins increase in skeletal muscle with age and leads to a buildup of lipofuscin and crosslinked proteins that are normally removed via the proteolysis system these proteins compile in the skeletal muscle tissue but are dysfunctional this leads to an accumulation of noncontractile material in the skeletal muscle this helps explain why muscle strength decreases severely as well as muscle mass in sarcopenia 5one group has suggested that the evolutionary basis for the failure of the body to maintain muscle mass and function with age is that the genes governing these traits were selected in a late paleolithic environment in which there was a very high level of obligatory muscular effort and that these genetic parameters are therefore illmatched to a modern lifestyle characterized by high levels of lifelong sedentary behavior 7epidemiological research into the developmental origins of health and disease has shown that early environmental influences on growth and development may have longterm consequences for human health low birth weight a marker of a poor early environment is associated with reduced muscle mass and strength in adult life 8 9 10 11 12 one study has shown that lower birth weight is associated with a significant decrease in muscle fibre score suggesting that developmental influences on muscle morphology may explain the widely reported associations between lower birth weight and sarcopenia 13diagnosis  edita working definition for diagnosis was proposed in 1998 by baumgartner et al which uses a measure of lean body mass as determined by dual energy xray absorptiometry dexa compared to a normal reference population his working definition uses a cut point of 2 standard deviations below the mean of lean mass for gender specific healthy young adults 14since baumgartners working definition first appeared some consensus groups have refined the definition including the european working group on sarcopenia in older people ewgsop their consensus definition is 3low muscle mass eg 2 standard deviations below that mean measured in young adults aged 18–39 years in the 3rd nhanes population of the same sex and ethnic background and either low gait speed eg a walking speed below 08 ms in the 4m walking testor low muscular strength eg grip strength 30 kg in males 20 kg in femalessevere sarcopenia requires the presence of all three conditions management  editexercise  editlack of exercise is thought to be a significant risk factor for sarcopenia 15 even highly trained athletes experience its effects masterclass athletes who continue to train and compete throughout their adult lives exhibit a progressive loss of muscle mass and strength and records in speed and strength events decline progressively after age 30 4 16masterclass athletes maintain a high level of fitness throughout their lifespan even among master athletes performance of marathon runners and weight lifters declines after approximately 40 years of age with peak levels of performance decreased by approximately 50 by 80 years of age 17 however a gradual loss of muscle fibers begins to occur at around 50 years of age 17exercise is of interest in treatment of sarcopenia evidence indicates increased ability and capacity of skeletal muscle to synthesize proteins in response to shortterm resistance exercise 18 a 2009 cochrane review also found evidence that in older adults progressive resistance training can improve physical performance gait speed and muscular strength 19 which are two key components of sarcopenia medication  editas of july 2015 there are no approved medications for the treatment of sarcopenia 1 however βhydroxy βmethylbutyrate hmb a metabolite of leucine which is sold as a dietary supplement has demonstrated efficacy in preventing the loss of muscle mass in individuals with sarcopenia 1 20 21 a growing body of evidence supports the efficacy of hmb as a treatment for reducing or even reversing the loss of muscle mass muscle function and muscle strength in hypercatabolic disease states such as cancer cachexia 22 23 24 consequently as of june 2016 it is recommended that both the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia and muscle wasting in general include supplementation with hmb regular resistance exercise and consumption of a highprotein diet 22 23 based upon a metaanalysis in 2015 hmb supplementation appears to be useful as a treatment for preserving lean muscle mass in older adults note 1 21 more research is needed to determine the precise effects of hmb on muscle strength and function in this age group 21dhea and human growth hormone have been shown to have little to no effect in this setting growth hormone increases muscle protein synthesis and increases muscle mass but does not lead to gains in strength and function in most studies 25 this and the similar lack of efficacy of its effector insulinlike growth factor 1 igf1 may be due to local resistance to igf1 in aging muscle resulting from inflammation and other age changes 25testosterone or other anabolic steroids have also been investigated for treatment of sarcopenia and seem to have some positive effects on muscle strength and mass but cause several side effects and raise concerns of prostate cancer in men and virilization in women 25 26 additionally recent studies suggest testosterone treatments may induce adverse cardiovascular events 27 28 29 other approved medications under investigation as possible treatments for sarcopenia include ghrelin vitamin d angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and eicosapentaenoic acid 25 26nutrition  editprotein intake and physical activity are important stimuli for muscle protein synthesis 30 a number of expert groups have proposed an increase in dietary protein recommendations for older age groups to 1012 gkg body weight per day 31 32epidemiology  edita study in community dwelling older adults with an average age of 67 years found the uk prevalence of sarcopenia to be 46 in men and 79 in women using the ewgsop approach 33 another study conducted in the united states among older adults with an average age of 701 years found the prevalence of sarcopenia to be 365 34 sarcopenia affects about half of people over 80 in new mexico 35society and culture  editthis section does not cite any sources please help

physical activity and increased longevity of industrialized populations sarcopenia is emerging as a major health concern sarcopenia may progress to the extent that an older person may lose his or her ability to live independently furthermore sarcopenia is an important independent predictor of disability in populationbased studies linked to poor balance gait speed falls and fractures sarcopenia can be thought of as a muscular analog of osteoporosis which is loss of bone also caused by inactivity and counteracted by exercise the combination of osteoporosis and sarcopenia results in the significant frailty often seen in the elderly population research directions  editmany opportunities remain for further refinement of reference populations by ethnic groups and to further correlate the degrees of severity of sarcopenia to overt declines in functional performance preferably using verified functional tests as well as incidence of hospitalization admissions morbidity and mortality the body of research points toward severe sarcopenia being predictive of negative outcomes similar to those already shown to exist with frailty syndrome as defined by the criteria set forth in 2001 by fried et al 36future research should aim to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of sarcopenia and the application of a lifecourse approach to understanding aetiology as well as to informing the optimal timing of interventions 37clinical practice  edithowever diagnosis can be difficult due to the comprehensive measurements used in research that are not always practical in healthcare settings hand grip strength alone has also been advocated as a clinical marker of sarcopenia that is simple and cost effective and has good predictive power although it does not provide comprehensive information 38exercise remains the intervention of choice for sarcopenia but translation of findings into clinical practice is challenging the type duration and intensity of exercise are variable between studies so an ‘off the shelf’ exercise prescription for sarcopenia remains an aspiration 39the role of nutrition in preventing and treating sarcopenia is less clear large welldesigned studies of nutrition particularly in combination with exercise are needed ideally across healthcare settings for now basing nutritional guidance on the evidence available from the wider health context is probably the best approach with little contention in the goals of replacing vitamin d where deficient and ensuring an adequate intake of calories and protein although there is debate about whether currently recommended protein intake levels are optimal 38 39see also  editsarcopenic obesity notes  edit the estimated standard mean difference effect size for the increase in muscle mass in the hmb treatment groups relative to controls was 0352 kilograms 078 lb with a 95 confidence interval of 011–0594 kilograms 024–131 lb 21 the studies included in the metaanalysis had durations

metabolite bhydroxy bmethylbutyrate hmb can improve muscle function in turn improving functional performance  these have identified the leucine metabolite βhydroxy βmethylbutyrate hmb as a potent stimulator of protein synthesis as well as an inhibitor of protein breakdown in the extreme case of cachexia 65 72 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 a growing body of evidence suggests hmb may help slow or even reverse the muscle loss experienced in sarcopenia and improve measures of muscle strength 44 65 72 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 however dietary leucine does not provide a large amount of hmb only a small portion as little as 5 of catabolized leucine is metabolized into hmb 85 thus although dietary leucine itself can lead to a modest stimulation of protein synthesis by producing a small amount of hmb direct ingestion of hmb more potently affects such signaling resulting in demonstrable muscle mass accretion 71 80 indeed a vast number of studies have found that supplementation of hmb to the diet may reverse some of the muscle loss seen in sarcopenia and in hypercatabolic disease 65 72 83 86 87 the overall treatment of muscle atrophy should include dietary supplementation with hmb
