northern part of the base used as a field for fixedwing aircraft and the extreme southern part near zeppelinheim serving as a base for rigid airships that section of rheinmain later became the base for the graf zeppelin its sister ship lz130 and until 6 may 1937 for the illfated hindenburg the airships were dismantled and their huge hangars demolished on 6 may 1940 during conversion of the base to military use luftwaffe engineers subsequently extended the single runway and erected hangars and other facilities for german military aircraft during world war ii the luftwaffe used the field sporadically as a fighter base and as an experimental station for jet aircraft first airport  editon 16 november 1909 the worlds first airline was founded in frankfurt am main the deutsche luftschiffahrtsaktiengesellschaft  delag  delag then built the first airport in frankfurt called airship base at rebstock which was located in bockenheim in the western part of the city and was primarily used for airships in the beginning it opened in 1912 and was extended after world war i but in 1924 an experts report already questioned the possibility of further expansions at this location with the foundation of deutsche luft hansa in 1926 a rapid boom of civilian air travel started and soon the airship base became too small to handle the demand plans for a new and larger airport located in the frankfurt city forest southwest of schwanheim were approved in 1930 but were not realised due to the great depression after the machtergreifung in 1933 the government revived the plans and started the construction of the new airport second airport  editfrankfurt airport in 1936 with several ju 523ms and fw 200s of deutsche lufthansa on the northern part of the airport originated in 1935 a twostorey station building with a sixstorey tower and other operating and outbuildings for maintenance and storage of aircraft the approximately 100 hectares runway received a grass cover the official opening of the new flug und luftschiffhafen rheinmain took place on july 8 1936 the first plane that landed was a ju 523m six days later on 14 july 1936 lz 127 graf zeppelin landed at the airport 1936 800 tons of cargo and 58000 passengers were transported in 1937 70000 passengers and 966 tons of cargo in the coming years the new airport was home base of the two largest german airships lz 127 graf zeppelin and lz 129 hindenburg  in 1938 frankfurt was a central distribution point for the transport of airmail to north america on may 6 1937 it came to a serious accident the hindenburg  on the way from frankfurt to new york exploded shortly before application in the landing area of lakehurst 36 people died the accident marked the end of the regular air shipping traffic and the end of the era of airships world war ii  editafter the beginning of world war ii in 1939 all foreign airlines left the airport and control of air traffic was transferred to the luftwaffe on 9 may 1940 the first bombers took off to attack france from august to november 1944 a concentration camp was established in walldorf close to the airport site where jewish female prisoners were forced to work for the airport the allies of world war ii destroyed the runway system with airstrikes in 1944 and the wehrmacht blew up buildings and fuel depots in 1945 shortly before the us army took control of the airport on 25 march 1945 after the german instrument of surrender the war in europe ended and the us army started to build a new temporary runway at frankfurt airport the southern part of the airport ground was occupied to build the rheinmain air base as an air force base for the united states air forces in europe berlin airlift  editrheinmain air base during the berlin airlift in 1948 the soviet union blocked the western allies rail and road access to the sectors of west berlin under allied control their aim was to force the western powers to allow the soviet zone to start supplying berlin with food and fuel thereby giving the soviets practical control over the entire city in response the western allies organised the berlin airlift to carry supplies via air to the people in west berlin the airports in frankfurt hamburg and hannover were the primary bases for allied aircraft the heavy use of these socalled  raisin bombers  caused damage to the runway in frankfurt and forced the us army to build a second parallel runway the airlift ended in september 1949 after the soviet union ended their blockade growth of the airport  editcivil air traffic at frankfurt airport in 1951an iran air boeing 707 –320b at frankfurt airport in 1970in 1951 restrictions for german air travellers were lifted and civil air traffic started to grow again in 1952 frankfurt airport handled more than 400000 passengers a year later it was more than half a million about 100 to 120 aeroplanes took off from and landed in frankfurt daily in 1955 lufthansa resumed flights to and from frankfurt and in the same year the federal republic of germany gained its air sovereignty back from the allies in 1957 the northern runway was extended first to 3000 m 9843 ft and then to 3900 m 12795 ft to make it compatible with jet aircraft the airport did not emerge as a major international airline hub until 1958 when a new passenger terminal called empfangsanlage ost terminal east literally arrival facility east opened in the northeast corner of the airport site only four years later it was clear that the terminal was already too small for the demand in 1961 frankfurt already had 22 million passengers and 81000 takeoffs and landings making it the second busiest airport in europe behind london–heathrow in 1962 it was decided to build an even larger terminal with a capacity of 30 million passengers per year work on this terminal began in 1965 the southern runway was extended to 3750 m 12303 ft in 1964 in 1970 a new hangar was inaugurated this accommodated six jet aircraft and was the worlds largest hangar at the time the new main terminal  editcheckin concourse a in terminal 1the new terminal called terminal mitte central terminal today known as terminal 1 is divided into three concourses a b and c with 56 gates and an electric baggage handling system everything opened to the public on 14 march 1972 it was assumed that the terminal capacity would be sufficient for the next 30 years along with the new terminal a railway station frankfurt airport station was opened the first airport railway station in the federal republic of germany a few days later the old empfangsanlage ost was closed the third runway  editplanning for a third runway called startbahn 18 west began in 1973 this project spawned massive protests by residents and environmentalists the main points of conflict were increasing noise and pollution and the cutting down of protected trees in the frankfurt city forest while the protests and related lawsuits were unsuccessful in preventing the construction of the runway the startbahn west protests were one of the major crystallisation points for the german environmental movement of the 1980s the protests even continued after the runway had been opened in 1984 and in 1987 two police officers were killed by a gunman this incident ended the startbahn west protests for good because of its orientation in the north–south direction in contrast to the other two runways which run east–west the use of the third runway is limited the startbahn west can only be used for takeoffs to the south because otherwise they would interfere with air traffic at the other runways due to this restriction the runway must be partially or fully closed when northward winds are too strong terminal 2 and the second railway station  editthe apron of terminal 2in 1990 work on a new terminal  terminal 2 began because it was anticipated that terminal mitte would reach its capacity limit sooner than expected the new terminal divided into concourses d and e was built to the east of the existing terminal where once the empfangsanlage ost had been with its opening in 1994 frankfurt airport increased its terminal capacity to 54 million passengers per year along with the terminal opening a people mover system called sky line was established to provide a fast connection between terminal 2 and terminal mitte now renamed terminal 1  in 1999 a second railway station primarily for inter city express longdistance trains called frankfurt airport longdistance station  opened near terminal 1 as part of the new cologne–frankfurt highspeed rail line at the same time local and regional rail services were based at the existing underground station now renamed frankfurt airport regional station closure of the rheinmain air base  editon 30 december 2005 the rheinmain air base in the southern part of the airport ground was closed and the us air force moved to ramstein air base the property was handed back to fraport which allows the airport to use it to build a new passenger terminal the property of the housing area for the soldiers called gateway gardens which was located northeast of the airport site was given back to the city of frankfurt in the same year and will be developed as a business district in the following years the airbus a380 and the squaire  editfrom 2005 to 2007 a large airbus a380 maintenance facility was built at frankfurt airport because lufthansa wanted to station their future a380 aircraft fleet there due to economic constraints only half of the facility has been built so far both terminals also underwent major renovations in order to handle the a380 including the installation of a third boarding bridge at several gates lufthansas first airbus a380 went into operation in june 2010 and was named frankfurt am main aerial view of the central airport buildings including the squaire in the back in 2011 a large office building called the squaire a portmanteau of square and air opened at frankfurt airport it was built on top of the airport longdistance station and is considered the largest office building in germany with 140000 m 2 1500000 sq ft floor area main

system with its two cabins can carry up to 1300 passengers per hour 8 the constructor of the system was the italian manufacturer leitner the fourth runway  editplans to build a fourth runway at frankfurt airport had been underway since 1997 but due to violent conflicts with the building of the third runway fraport let residents groups and environmentalists participate in the process to find a mutually acceptable solution in 2000 a task force presented their conclusion which generally approved a new runway but in shorter length only 28 kilometres compared to the other three 4kilometrelong runways which would serve as a landingonly runway for smaller aircraft additional requirements included improved noise protection arrangements and a strict ban on night flights between 11 pm and 5 am across the whole airport in 2001 fraport applied for an approval to build a new runway with three possible variants assessed this concluded that a runway northwest of the airport site would have the least impact on local residents and the surrounding environment the plans were approved by the hessian government in december 2007 but the requested ban on night flights was lifted because it was argued that an international airport like frankfurt would need night flights especially for worldwide freight transport construction of the new 2800 m 9186 ft long runway northwest in the kelsterbach forest began in early 2009 developments since 2011  editthe new runway officially went into operation on 20 october 2011 with an aircraft carrying chancellor angela merkel performing the first landing on 21 october the centre line separation from the existing north runway is about 1400 m 4593 ft this allows simultaneous instrument landing system ils operations on these two runways which has not been possible on the other parallel runways which do not meet the 3500foot minimum separation for ils operations 9 this allowed the airport to increase its capacity from 83 to 126 aircraft movements per hour 10 11on 11 october 2011 the hessian administration court ruled that night flights between 11pm and 5am the socalled mediationsnacht are no longer allowed at frankfurt airport after the inauguration of the new runway and therefore overrode the approval from the hessian government from 2007 which allowed 17 scheduled flights per night on 4 april 2012 the german administrative court confirmed the decision of the hessian administration court banning night flights between 11pm and 5am 12to handle the predicted passenger amount of about 90 million in 2020 a new terminal section
