outcome of the tragic imprisonment of our dip lomats in iran the u s must re assess its prospects and the pros pects of its allies and friends in the troubled middle east he added it goes without saying in 1979 that it is im perative that our oil lifeline to that area of the globe be pre served the stable governments that exercise authority in the region must have reason to believe that the u

bases in the world baker pointed out that they are capable of handling americas giant b52 bombers today as a result of the impressive success of the peace process between egypt and israel he said

not over even after a peace treaty is signed the challenge is to respond to this new situation with sagacity and substance much remains to be done in setting a new course the goal is before us the jnf will chart the way these are the words of rabbi william berkowitz national president of the jewish national fund they are apt words they generalize what moshe rivlin chairman of the jnf board of directors in jerusalem has said in specific terms that israels new horizon is in the negev where 80 new villages must be established 2000 kilometers of roads built 40000 acres of afforestation take place 12000 acres of wasteland prepared for new farming and 1000 parks to be established for recreation areas the jewish national fund has for upward of threequarters of a century been the land reclamation agency of israel from prestatehood days to today these and other facets of jnf affairs will be aired at the organizations annual banquet sunday at the fontainebleau hilton especially the happy statistic of a vibrant jewish nation that the jewish national fund projects the development of a land base for five million israelis by 1990 the business of terrorists of little notice was the general assemblys generous vote for a resolution to dismiss the camp david accord as irrelevant in a word the united nations has legislated the accord out of existence led by the third world the world peace organization moved to legitimize the terrorism of the palestinian movement but this is the same movement that conducts the war against the united states not only in iran but also elsewhere through out the middle east the grand irony is that it is to this peace organization that we have appealed to for action against irans kidnaping of american citizens and holding them as hostages until we do ayatollah khomeinis bidding in the case of the shah what can we expect from the united nations in our opinion nothing more than a lot of sanc timonious palaver only the likes of a jesse jackson can make sense out of this senseless situation in the third worlds rise on the scruff of our necks only he can applaud meanwhile the camp david accord no longer exists except of course for israel and egypt who already seem to be benefiting from its arrangements but then the united nations is against that sort of thing peace is not the business of terrorists spotlighting the future floridas jewish

the events themselves except the most obvious facets of the superficial facts for the most part they do not know what is worse they do not care they fail to grasp the central issues involved and how these issues will influence their lives their fortunes their futures or even the way in which they may be forced to fight and die the sad fact is that they are illiterate in the sense that reading is a chore for them and some indeed are functionally illiterate they do not read not out of choice but because they have difficulty with the process as a skill jjlli lnlll mhimmmimr leo mindlin 71111 i i then what are they doing on a college campus that is a complex question having more to do with realpolitik than with epistemology the study of the methods of imparting knowledge more important would be the answer to this kind of a question how did they get that way as a national badge of dishonor another one of those in terminable bureaucratic reports out of washington the other dav came up with the usual con clusions of which only bureaucracy is capable that is to say a conclusion long since known by just about everyone else and without having to pay for it either american high schools are in a frightening condition of desuetude the report preceded by less than a week still another bureaucratic bombshell thi one from the state of florida that floridas high school students are lower on the scale of current national norms than they were before and from the states most populous dade county that a blue ribbon panel is about to investigate the wasteland of its own high school fruitlessness what has all this to do with college students who show little or no interest in iran because in order to know more about iran than brief television reports can teach them they would have to do some reading the bureaucrats will say everything the teacher must reply little or nothing literacy is not a question of meeting national achievement norms established by bureaucrats be they political bureaucrats or bureaucrats in education revving up a students capacity to achieve a minimal test score is a selfdeceiving and selfdefeating activity the student longing for the social approval such an achievement will bring meets the challenge and succeeds and the bureau crats cluck with satisfaction because the statistics now declare that everything is kosher but the illiteracy persists because education generally and literacy specifically have nothing to do with norms graphs com puterized analyses and the other paraphernalia of what an ex pensive bureaucracy conceives of continued on page 17a is navon aching to quit job friday december 71979 volume 52 haifa there are recurrent romors here that president yitzhak navon is seriously considering resigning from hio post some of these rumors are idle speculation by citizens who seek to impress their cafe friends with the extent of their political acumen others come out of the murky waters of machiavellian political scheming which seeks to set in motion events that would serve specific political purposes whatever the source of the latest stories several fairly clear scenarios can be sketched one has it that navon feels frustrated in his high state post which has all the trappings of honor and glory but is almost completely devoid of any true authority responsibility or opportunity to exercise an in fluence on national policies that is the way the office of the presidency was set up 32 years ago tailored for the countrys first president chaim weizmann who was already ailing and almost blind when he took office most of his suc cessors were already of advanced age so that the absence of any real challenge in the office was to them a virtue rather than a fault navon on the other hand is only 58 he finds himself both fettered and gagged since the president is supposed to be both above and outside of partisan politics where all the action is before he was named president he was a leading member of the labor party and his election nevertheless during the begin administration was a remarkable tribute to his popularity carl alpert his full fiveyear term of office would carry him a year beyond the next scheduled knesset elections and the next ad ministration whether likud or labor would find navon still in his neutral political nomans land and out of the main stream of those who make and influence policies if he were to decide to quit and reenter politics he cannot wait much longer it is generally agreed that a retiring president like a retiring general cannot leap straight into politics on the basis of the prestige of his previous post a cooling off period is necessary possibly as much as a year such a deadline is rapidly approaching if navon seeks to leave the ceremonial reviewing stand and descend into the arena there can be little doubt that he still retains his old labor party loyalties it must hurt him to see the party torn by the bitter personal feuds for the leadership between peres rabin allon and others this at a time when many believe that a strong united labor can effectively unseat the begin coalition at the next election the present in fighting on the left menaces the possibility the popular yitzhak navon could become the rallying point for a rejuvenated labor party he is a sephardi and that is a powerful asset he has a warm personality he speaks english french spanish arabic and other languages with as much fluency as his native hebrew it has become clear that the masses respond to him more en thusiastically than to any other personality on the israel scene today there is a variation to this scenario begin may not succeed in maintaining the stability of his coalition the divided labor party may not be able to present a united front a national crisis would threaten at this point the cry would go up for establish ment of a national walltowall unity government embracing the major parties of both left and right and with yitzhak navon as the prime minister should the president agree his candidacy would be we hnigh irresistible he could become the strong man many say israel needs the masses would look to him as a savior and because he comes with labor credentials no one could apply to him those epithets of dictator or fascist which would inevitably have been attached to a leader who came from the ranks of tne right but what does navon himseii say according to one report ne intends to complete the five years to which he was elected according to another report he already under pressure from some of his friends and suitable circumstances

extreme enough in the judgment of members of the congress to have taken action which i again say has been somewhat effective asked whether he had any thoughts on a pending trade agreement with the soviet he replied none that i would express here on the arab boycott law he said from everything ive heard it s been fair and just i dont plan to do anything more than seeing that its fair and just as

did not see any purpose being served by introducing a strange partner at this time asked about the meaning at this lime klutznick replied that the settlement process was estab lished under the egyptianisraeli treaty of mar 26 and they should get a fair chance to work out a settlement before any thing is done to interfere with it noting that egypt and israel have made progress he stressed a middle east peace is not a simple problem and observed egypt and israel have until may 1 to agree on a west bankgaza autonomy plan that leaves open the question of what course he may have to take when

february 1978 when he met with egyptian president anwar sadat during a tense and delicate period in israeliamericanegyp tian relations when it appeared a movement was underway to split the jewish community i dont happen to believe american jews should engage in avoiding a guest of the president even though you dont agree with him klutznick said in the jta interview he minimized that particular dispute noting we have controversies for 48 hours within the jewish community exemplifying his re sourcefulness klutznick after that controversy subsided successfully suggested later that year to

from her ceaseless efforts for her husbands freedom mrs sharansky met with reporters at a breakfast at the national press club appeared on television and later was a guest at a reception at the capitol hosted by rep robert drinan d mass  who she described as a dear friend of our family the reporters received  copies of her personal account of her life entitled next year in jerusalem which were anatolys last words when his trial ended in moscow in 1977 the book written with liana benjoseph and translated from russian by stefani hoffman is the story of two young people who married for love and were separated because they are jewish mrs sharansky emigrated to israel in july 1973 the day after her wedding in moscow she has not been permitted to visit her husband since then mrs sharansky explained the background of what she called the double standard the soviets employ regarding dissidents as an example she said the soviet government produced the very aggressive television film against israel and zionism that emphasized to the soviet peoples we have here in the soviet union soldiers of zionism meaning she said persons like anatoly the slepaks and ida nudel mrs sharansky observed that on the one hand the soviet government makes an anti semitic atmosphere in the street and on the other hand it wont let them the dissidents out she said that with the 1980 olympic games in moscow only eight months away jews in the soviet union are saying were afraid that the roundups and removals from moscow and other cities that preceded the visit of president nixon in 1972 will be repeated to avoid possible contacts with foreigners mrs sharansky urged that letters from individuals and statements by officials be sent to the soviet authorities to explain to the russians in a big public campaign that in her special case anatoly is sick and that other jews want to emigrate too msw at barry college miami florida pursue your msw at barry college in beautiful miami shores florida

any change for better or worse not only in human relations but in politics  it is a slow evolution that chanced to be epressed now  i love my ieoplc i love our country and therefore i am concerned as to the fate of my people and of our country he said tiik w ihi i famous violinist spoke in a similar vein in an interview published in ycdiol achnmol several days later he said there was an adverse change in the relations of american jews toward israel we shall come now to israel with far less happy expectations than before many jews cherished the hope that with the establishment of the jewish state in 1948 their generations old longings and yearnings for human relations society economy and way of life would be fulfilled many are disap ikiinied stern was quoted as saying his articulation of his feelings provoked thoughtful com mentaries by s z abramov a former knesset member who is chairman of the israeli kxecutive of the world jewish congress and by llanoch liartov a prominent israeli journalist abramov writing in haarvtz and katun in muuriv agreed that stern had simply expressed what is well known that the image of israel in the eyes of jews abroad is no longer entirely positive but their anxiety over the fate of the state prevented them from voicing their thoughts as if they coerced themselves into silence and repressed their feelings of disappointment never before was the image of israel at such a low ebb as it is today abramov wrote it is this government that should have won the esteem and glory for the peace with egypt our jewish brethren could have pointed out this government for its generosity and readiness for concessions for peace and yet the image of the government and the state has gone down not only among the nations of the world but among our jewish brethren spokesmen for the jewish groups can hardly grasp or explain to the outside world what are the positions and considerations of the government and they seem lost and em iwrrassed abramov acknowledged that the deterioration began during the previous governments when amny visiting jews with strong ties to israel began to notice the decline in cultural level lack of good manners deterioration of the rule of law the increased parasitism the catchascatch can policy of the trade unions the escape from labor bureaucratism  and the decline in the cultural level of the leadership of israel  the writer observed that the present leaders of israel unlike their predecessors david ben iurion l meir are seen only as heads of government not as leaders of the jewish nation the scope of the decline of israels image is evident from the attitude of the diaspora toward the principle of the centrality of israel in jewish life if ten years ago this principle was accepted without skepticism there are now many who ad vocate against it abramov wrote bartov in maariv said sterns world were a calculated hoarse dissonance and ap parently he felt that sometimes even the music of his stradivarius is not enough to shake the israelis so he reverted to simple outoftheheart words  they are tough they ex pressed fear that the everready reflex of everyone is against us may be invoked again and i can hear in my ears those who will claim that it is not for any klezmer musician to tell us what to do bartov wrote others will say that with all due respect it is not for jews from the gocii to teach us how to handle state affairs and still others may say that stern is a world famous violinist but what does he know about politics economics settlements what he feared most bartov wrote is that the leadership may simply ignore the whole affair but the true facts are that you need not be isaac stem and you need not be a guest to see what stern saw and said every israeli can look around him and see for himself that there is a total disconnection betweeh what hap pens among the men in the street and the leadership that it seems as if one does not un derstand the language of the other that there is a lack of real leadership social or economic bartov worte looks to me typically south african the argus passover rabbi aaron gelman and universal kosher tours present the diplomat

similarities between judaism and islam closer than either is to the third sister christianity not only do both pray to the same allmerciful god neither recognizes any mediator between the individual

maelite caliph omar this was long before spains golden age islam remarked prof s d goitein is from the very flesh and bone of judaism a theme supported by the koran itself we believe in what was revealed to abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the tribes the koran appears also to contain a special message for israelites ishmaelites syrians lebanese and sheban ethiopians allah ordains that blood relations are closer to one another than to other believers proselytes so whence the animosity towards jewry if the koran itself contains the fruits of biblical and talmudic judaism the animosity can only arise from blatant misinterpretations of islam itself a blindness worse than endemic trachoma though araby itself is not inhospitable to fanatics in our  the finest catered affairs happen at

maels scimitar thus a north african islamicist one taha of cairo wrote these lines why should i simply repeat what the ancients said the hebrew torah may speak to us about abraham and ishmael and the arab koran may tell us about them too but the mention of these names in the torah and the koran is not sufficient to establish their historical existence let alone the story which tells us about the emigration of ishmael the son of abraham to mecca and the birth of the arabicized arabs sic there we are compelled to see in this story a kind of fiction in tended to establish the relations of jews and arabs on the one hand and islam and judaism and the kora and the torah on the other it is less surprising to leam that this islamic questioner of the koran taha was a con temporary of gamal abdel nasser whose egypt often upset the purist saudis on religious grounds to the point of ruptured diplomatic links proselytes are said to veer from fanatic zeal to intellectual reluctance and even alienation if so muslims are no exception the shias of iran seem to represent the former the neo destour of tunisia appear to reflect the latter examples of both can no doubt be found from the malayalam countries and pakistan to the muslim areas of tropical africa sometimes the arabians themselves suffer ignominy at the hand of those their ancestors forcibly converted from the fatimid heresy to shia excesses did not those whom paul con verted to at least the ten commandments provide his people with an inquisition whatever the dangerous analogies it remains true that todays antiisrael stances come most stridently from those whose holy book contains all that is necessary to understand jewrys love for zion zionism so the question remains who will yet speak for the true

soviet jews who resist the pressure to assimilate or denounce their heritage and remain firm in their desire to live in israel find their visas tangled in red tape a recent ruling requires jews wishing to emigrate to supply visovs in vitations only from firstdegree relatives parents or siblings the life of a refusenik in the ussr is never pleasant but life for one in kharkov is particularly grim the treatment of aleksandr parilsky one of kharkovs best known refuseniks is typical of the soviets ideological warfare paritsky a physicist lost his job in 1977 a year after he and his wife polina and two young daughters applied to emigrate to israel over the past three years the paritskys have been sub jected to constant harrassment kgb surveillance and slanderous attacks in the media on june 10 1979 paritdky placed a phone call to the u s from the local post office a kgb agent standing next to the phone booth began shouting that paritsky was divulging secret editors xote life for a jewish refusenik in many of the large cities in the ussr can often be a stifling and frustrating experience the national conference on soviet jewrys kim kovach focuses on kharkov a major ukranian city that over the years has gained a reputation as one of the centers of soviet antisemitism this city and its inhabitants are an integral part of the struggle for freedom for soviet jewry information and that he was a spy a policeman at the scene reported the kgb agents description of the incident to his superiors in september paritsky was tried in absentia for the post office incident by a special comrades court at the kharkov tractor factory where he is employed the court heard no evidence in paritsky s defense and therefore delivered a verdict of guilty recommending a two week jail sentence for hooliganism and behavior generally unbecoming to a soviet citizen the aleksandr gor shunsky family are also victims of the frustrating life of kharkov refuseniks aleksandr 38 his

stated that thev have no ob jection to aleksandr s parents leaving the soviet union the gorshunskys still wait in limbo in another related incident a young married couple in kharkov submitted their

organization lea er yasir arafat to paris the participants adopted a resolution calling on the french government to adopt a more balanced policy in the middle east and warning that an invitation to arafat to visit paris would be considered an insult and a provocation by all freedom loving people in france the speakers including several nonjews such as gen pierre lecomte president of the franceisrael alliance and mariemadeleine fourcade president of the resistance action committee stressed that the plo charter provides for israels destruction french authorities say there are no immediate plans for an arafat visit to france but that no basic dif ficulties exist it is believed that the visit is being held up by french demands of palestinian concessions in south lebanon such as

preapred to use our influenci u obtain a role for jordan ii jerusalem  goldberg tells it he merely assured jordans king hussein at the un that the u s did not envisage a west bank without a jordanian presence i didnt define what that presence should be goldberg added goldberg said that after reading kissingers account he reviewed the diplomatic record with lormer undersecretary of state joseph sisco with whom he had worked closely during the months leading to the adoption of resolution 242 goldberg said that his recollection coincides with that of sisco kissinger did not enter the u s government until 19691 a former supreme court justice ioldberg said kissinger blamed his researchers for the published version promising to correct the record in his second volume scheduled for release in un wont let israel show film on plo by yitzhak rabi kv york jta the plo in independentlyproduced swiss film documentary on the terrorism of the palestine liberal ion organization was

by the plo with brief interviews with experts on terrorism among them former israel un ambassador chaim herzog the film stresses that plo terrorism to indiscriminately aimed at civilians and that its victims are people of all nationalities as well as jews and israelis asked by reporters if he was happy with the film israel ambassador yehuda blum told reporters he thought there is much more to be said on the ssue and that an indepth analysis of the reasons and results of plo terrorism would require a longer film he also said the flm failed to show that the j lo was the initiator of seizing diplomats and hostages and executing them arthur goldberg 1981 but goldberg has asked kissinger to offer a public correction before publication of the next volume the matter is still very sen sitive because of the conflicting interpretations of resolution 242 s requirement for territorial withdrawal the resolution merely calls for withdrawal from territories captured during the war it does not say all the ter ritories or even the territories a deliberate omission ac cording io goldberg leaving the do ol open lor territorial ad justments ioldberg said the first i s official to call tor only minor adjustments was formei set retarj ol state  illiam rogers in when he announced the so called rogers plan since then successive i s administrations have supported only minor adjustments president jimmj carter articulated this view on march 9 1977 less than two months alter taking office more recently republican presidential contender john connally has called for israels neartotal with drawal from the disputed lands the arabs backed by the soviet union have consistently called for nothing less than total withdrawal israeli governments both the labor and likud have supported significant changes in the pre 1967 lines the major difference between the labor and likud view of resolution 242 involves the question of territorial withdrawal on all the fronts including the w est bank labor which favors a territorial partition of the west hank bays yes prime minister begin and likud bay no golbergs position that res lution 1 requin d an undefined jordanian presence on the west hank would seem to back up the labor version but the former i  ambassador is firm in denying that he ever em isaged only minor territorial ad justments he wasclearlj upset that his original interpretation of reso lution 242 has been twisted by both republican and democratic administrations since the rogers plan ioldberg who represented the united states two years ago at the belgrade conference on human rights and the helsinki commission was also upset by henry kissinger kissingers assertion that he had favored a speedup in trade development with the soviet union shortly after the russian invasion of

announced this week publication of a book on the two agencies landmark project to integrate general and judiac studies on a scale never previously attempted in the field of day school programming the 144page volume entitled interdisciplinary integration in the jewish school describes all phases of the innovative venture that was conducted from 1974 to 1977 in the fifth and sixth grade classes of the south dade hebrew academy under orthodox auspices in miami beach and the hillel community day school under jewish com munal auspices in north miami beach the integration effort was conceived out of the need to try to overcome the artificial division between the secular and judaic curricula in jewish day scholls said fradle freidenreich of the aaje over all consultant on the project mrs freidenreich consultant on methods and materials to the aajes national curriculum research institute said such a division tends to compart mentalize study for the day school students and frequently results in a learning gap be tween the themes and concepts he is asked to absorb in his general and judaic studies classes the gap widens she said each time an american history course ignores the political eco nomic and cultural life of u s jewry or when study of the bible is related minimality if at all to contemporary thought and experience or when jewish history is taught in virtual isolation from contiguous events in world civilization abraham j gittelson associate director of the miami caje and coauthor of the book with mrs freidenreich said the project sought to close this gap by employing an in terdisciplianry and mutually by employing an inter disciplinary and mutually re inforcing curricular approach designed to synthesize general and judaic subject matter for example

jewish federations gmjf volunteer service bureau center standing directs a group of her 218 volunteer workers in a project h the gmjf combined jewish appealisrael emergency fund campaign or a labor of love volunteer service bureau one woman has been coming twice a week for five years after having heard from a neighbor that the people over at federation need some volunteer help another was at the greater miami jewish federation gmjf building a year ago to present her annual gift to the combined jewish appeal israel emergency fund campaign and heard about the volunteer service bureau six years after its near spontaneous birth in the midst of the 1973 yom kippur war and its af termath the gmjf volunteer service bureau now revolves around a core of 218 volunteers each week who provide the various federation departments with a variety of backup services which would otherwise cost gmjf 500000 annually the near overwhelming show of support by greater miami jewry in the fall of 1973 for the state of israel led to the mobilization of a volunteer group consisting of individuals of all ages and walks of life who felt the need to do something more than make a donation to the war effort those hundreds of volunteers began to work with a smaller group organized that year to provide support services for various federation special events and projects throughout the 1973 war months and their aftermath those volunteer crews spent their time collecting checks from people unable to mail them or bring them to the federation building for processing in addition to long hours on the telephone taking pledges night and day for support for israel that war was the glue which bound all of us together recalls one volunteer once the fighting was over and things settled down to normal i never thought to stop coming here twice a week just as i had been doing all of those months there was always something here for me to do and i felt needed and wanted the 1053 manhours put in weekly by the volunteers in the bureau are used to process thousands of pieces of multipage bulk mailings and untold numbers of other materials brought up to the bureau office for assembly some volunteers have been living in miami for decades others are new arrivals who have yet to establish close friendships what the volunteer service bureau provides is a sense of belonging of contributing of doing something meaningful to help the community and to help israel said one volunteer another woman who recently celebrated her fourth anniversary working in the bureau said she had never even heard of federation before coming to volunteer service at the urging of a friend now if i dont show up one week i receive a flood of phone calls from people asking if i am feeling poorly or if i need any help you really find a family here and for somebody who is alone that means everything in the world when i think now about what i know about the miami jewish community and israel from working here and compare it to what i knew four years ago i embarrass myself with my former ignorance said one miami beach resident it means a bus ride with a transfer for me to get here but i wouldnt miss coming here for the world said another volunteer l jules arkin president of the greater miami jewish federation called the volunteer service bureau an example of giving in the best meaning of the word what these people do for federation cannot be measured in terms of dollars theirs is a labor of love those in the community interested in working with the volunteer service bureau can contact evelyn kopelman at

from tel aviv university school of communication disorders several years ago as a speech pathologist and applied for work with people suffering from voice speech or language difficulties she was told there were few such problems in israel nor was there a need for a special professional to deal with the few cases there were today not only mrs eyal now a teacher at the school but most of the other graduates as well as student ap prentices working toward a b a degree are in urgent demand by schools hospitals clinics and private doctors the only institution of its kind in israel the tel aviv university school for communication disorders was established 10 years ago as a pioneering venture by the american jewish joint distribution committee jdc and the ministry of health each contributing equally to its budget the jdc receives the bulk of its funds from campaigns such as the greater miami jewish federations combined jewish appealisrael emergency fund a branch of tel aviv universitys sackler school of medicine the school is a selfcontained unit in the audiology building of the sheba medical center tel ilashomer the school trains audiology speech and language clinicians and qualifies graduates with a b a degree to continue studies for their masters degree in the field setting down guidelines for training since the schools establishment is its director prof moshe rubenstein chief of the ear nose and throat department of the sheba medical center deafness with its subsequent com munication problems represents one of the most isolating forces dr rubinstein said the noises of modem life war army training improper acoustics in factories jand public buildings the low profile the j problem is given by the information media and lack of awareness of its ravaging consequences by people in general and even some physicians are all contributing factors to bringing about and perpetuating hearing impairment it is a vicious cycle he said the inability to adjust to ones environment leads to further isolation and further gaps in communication it is all the more tragic because deafness is an invisible malfun ctioning and gives misleading impressions of a persons intelligence personality and aptitudes it is a vicious cycle he said the inability to adjust to ones environment leads to further isolation and further gaps in communication itis all the more tragic because deafness is an invisible malfun ctioning and gives misleading impressions of a persons intelligence personality and aptitudes dr rubinstein cites the case of a hard working executive who had started at the bottom of the firm and at 45 was finally in a top position no one could be a greater asset recently however his mind ap peared to be wandering his colleagues feel that he give irrelevant answers to questions put to him at board meetings they note he does not grasp what is going on it turns out to be a hearing problem deafness which strikes at a crucial moment in a mans career when he is most productive is especially destructive causing severe psychological problems a feeling of humiliation and paranoia dr rubinstein declares hearing and speech difficulties come together but there are many other reasons why speech and language problems develop disabilities may show up in children who are retarded or suffer from some physiological disorder such as brain damage cerebral palsy or some other problem uri a veteran of the yom kippur war talks very loudly youd think he was still in a tank his mother complains the way he does not distinguish when his voice rises or falls zev a high school student is hoarse and getting hoarser sometimes you can hardly hear him he is ashamed to speak up in class and is becoming sullen and with drawn doron a delightful fiveyearold stutters when he talks the words coming out in a jumble his mother knows he is hyperactive he cant sit still but she has no idea what it has to do with the way he speaks all share a in common a communication disability rehabilitation includes teaching the deaf to speak by sensing vibrations of silent letters not easily discernible by lip reading where there has been a laryngectomy removal of the larynx the speech pathologist helps the patient to relearn speech by use of the esophagus as a sub stitute for the larynx the tel aviv university school of communication disorders has so far turned out 200 professionals qualified to test and treat auditory voice speech and ar ticulation problems because training is so costly registration is limited to about 20 students a year each ot whom is grabbed up immediately on completing his course a crowded bulletin board with listings of job openings at the entrance of the audiology building is an indication of the need for trained professionals in the field we just cant turn them out fast enough dr rubinstein admits qmjf to help carrmooian refugees thi american jewish community has expressed grout concern over the deteriorating situation in cumlxdia and is anxious to help said l jules at kin president of the greater miami jewish fed eration we have informed the miami jewish com munity that they may help by sending their con tributions direct to the american jewish joint dis tribution committee which is working with the inlcrlailli hunger appeal the church world son ices and the catholic relief services to provide some relief for millions of starving cambodians the american jewish joint distribution com miltoe is a major beneficiary of the greater miami jewish federations combined jewish appealisrael kincrgeiicy fund campaign and is the major american agency serving jewish communities in need abroad we wholeheartedly support the efforts of the us government to bring aid to the endangered cuinbodian people mr

ross chair man of greater miami jewish federations leadership development committee they bring new ideas enthusiasm and fresh view points into our federation family they help provide a direction for positive creative change our objective is to assist these in dividuals to play even more effective leader ship by widening their outlook and ning their insights ffl u is a stepping ne to future involvement the jewish community  entrylevel experience were betting will be a positive one wt two years ago the federation board recognized the need for organizing a fulltime leadership development program the programs purpose to reach out into the community and train people for positions of leadership in the federation and the organized jewish community simultaneously there was the recog nition that the leadership development programs should move beyond an orientation to local agencies and into areas of jewish content skills and issues the multifaceted programs developed over the past two years have utilized a variety of approaches in meeting these goals and objectives the roots of this program however go back to the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war in 1973 the yom kippur war spurred a group of young miamians interest in aiding the israel emergency fund voluntarily a few young leaders got together and hosted an israel emergency fund meeting that ex citing involvement continued as more meetings were held for the same purpose as greater numbers of young people became involved the young adults division became a reality ross said today the organization numbers over 1000 the y a d composed of young men and women in their 20s and early 30s provides a variety of cultural educational and social programs through these programs y a d gives every young jewish adult the oppor tunity to explore his or her role in the jewish community and to demonstrate a commit ment to the survival and enrichment of jews in miami israel and throughout the world y a d is a stepping stone to future involvement in the jewish community according to jack levine its 26yearold chairman it is everyones first taste of what it is like to work within the framework of the organized jewish community and federation an entrylevel experience were betting will be a positive one recently 27 members of federations young adults division returned from a 10 day study mission to israel where they had a firsthand opportunity to acquaint themselves with the problems and concerns of israel and her people we were learning through seeing and doing said levine i returned home touched in so many ways my sense of history and my understanding of the human problems of israel was deepened my feelings d commitment were strengthened and reaffirmed milton heller director of federations leadership development and young adults division who has staffed nine previous missions offered his personal reflections on the groups mission experience you begin to experience the reality of the jewish past when you walk through biblical jerusalem you tee what it must have been like 2000 year ago you feel an exceptionally strong sense of kinship with the jewish people and realize that wherever we are we are one is much more than campaign rhetoric it becomes a reality according to levine a summer mission for y a ders is in the planning stages slated to depart for israel at the beginning of august a sevenweek learnin educational series has been scheduled to explore jewish medical philosophies it will examine jewish views on such controversial subjects as abortion and euthanasia led by a panel of religious leaders and medical professionals a large delegation of y a d members will participate in the united jewish appeals leadership conference in washington d c this coming february ross believes that each of us is a link in the chain of jewish tradition the strength and depth of our commitment will determine in large measure the strength of the chain after 2000 years we are witnessing the rebirth and growth of israel and her people i dont want to sit on the sidelines and watch it happen i want to be a part of it i think young couples today are proud to be jews ross continues i dont think antisemitism is the problem it was a generation ago young couples strongly identify as jews belong to a synagogue and usually send their children to sunday school yet while they have this deep emotional com mitment to judaism they often have a shallow intellectual understanding of their jewishness they discover they want to know more they find out that their friends feel the same way they do leadership development groups com posed of couples in their 30s and 40s attempt to provide a forum for young couples who share this desire to learn this need to know a ifter 2000 years we are witnessing the rebirth and growth of israel and her people i dont want to sit on the sidelines and watch it happen i want to be apart of it 9f this need for selfexpression we get a small group together one that can fit into a livingroom usually no more than 25 the participating couples share common socioeconomic backgrounds as well as common feelings ross added the structure of the program is sequential and revolves around a series of educational units each building upon the other in the initial unit we find ways to get participants to express themselves and focus on their jewish consciousness and jewish values we discuss positive and negative religious experiences in our lives and how we would like our children to feel about their judaism when they are grown through these discussions we learn a lot about each other and build a sense of group identity and cohesiveness once we become comfortable with one another we get into the substantive part of the program the second unit focuses on the intel lectual and historical experience of the jew as he encounters the modern world and how these experiences helped shape the con temporary jewish community the third unit explores major issues facing the jewish community today in cluding such topics as the jews of russia the state of jewish education today and the jewish aged the fourth unit studies the work and problems of a selected group of local and national jewish agencies in the greater miami area unit five provides an opportunity for continued on page 8 pu blic invited to boa r6 of di recio rs meeting
