the view amazingreport helpful can pan vancouver10 dined on 19 february 2018the view is wasted on this terrible restaurant the lady who led us to our table was very rude after sitting down we waited for a long time to have our order taken only after multiple complaints to multiple waiters did we have our order taken the food in general was average however i ordered beef to be cooked medium rare and it came out to be well done if i could i wouldn’t hesitate to give this restaurant a zero star read more report helpful bgbg10 dined on 18 february 2018very disappointed experience with the service of manager in suit at dining area and a tall waiter in bar area we were directed to a dinner table for 2 which was not a window table as it was a special occasion to celebrate my husbands promotion we would really like to have a window table over dinner or a drink at the bar area and we did not mind waiting the manager told us he can check and will come back to us in 2 minutes he never did and he passed by our table several times ignoring us after dinner we wanted to try to get a window table at the bar area this tall waiter just gave us the duh look without any explanation i understand it is extremely difficult to get a window table but we would really appreciate if both of them could go an extra mile with a smile in their service we did not expect to pay this much with unprofessional service read more report helpfulvip open table diner london10 dined on 18 february 2018we had probably the worst dining experience we’ve ever had in london and from the tables around us who were also complaining we were not alone when we arrived we were rudely met by the front of house who ushered into a holding area with no communication we were then unable to get a drink or any attention and were left there for 30 minutes we were about to leave when we were finally seated although the waitress had no idea where she was taking us and so lead us around in circles once we’d ordered  the set menu to hopefully speed things up  there was a significant delay before any food arrived and they missed the amuse bouche entirely once we’d had the starter we then had a 30 minute wait for the main course whilst one of our waiters was very friendly the majority and we seemed to have a number ranged from surly to downright rude whilst the view is incredible the food is only just about ok it’s over priced and the service was awful very disappointed and clearly never returning read more report helpful janine m london10 dined on 18 february 2018i have been to the aqua shard before good so i decided to book for the brunch after visiting the tate modern with 2 overseas guests it was a mistake and i feel terrible about being the one who organised it i dont like it when you book have an email confirmation and then have to battle past 2 gatekeepers who act so snootily like you have no booking even though you are clearly on the list so pretentious not a good start  you are treated like an unwelcome visitor it took 1 hour to get our drinks over and 15 hours to get the mains  despite regular prodding the answer was yes yes and then the multiple wait staff would rotate the tables before heading off out the back to disappear we asked for some olive oil to have with the bread at least 5 times and it finally came with our desserts there seemed to be plenty of wait staff but they were all running around like chickens with no heads the beef main for my friend was not medium rare  it was still mooing  big slices of raw meat the chef should be ashamed we returned it once and it was brought back exactly the same to be returned again this was terribly embarrassing for my guest who does not like to complain  even when it was entirely necessary she had to have some toast when we got home because she was hungry my cod cakes were fine came with not even 1 vegetable or a side salad and the risotto needed salt againhad to wait and wait for it the gentleman on the table next to us his 50th birthday was in the same boat and wasnt going to complain until we shared our unhappiness he had booked the 5 course brunch and 2 courses were missing free glass of wine instead how can this be missing when you turn up he was very upset and was about to miss his taxi because the service was so slow he had checked in advance and booked the taxi 30 mins after advised end time of course we would have preferred to be welcomed and to be given what was booked in a timely manner read more report helpful nisha n manchester30 dined on 17 february 2018the view is unparalleled and that what its all about the food was very tasty and the set menu is worth it more than the a la carte the drinks are too pricey even the water the people who served us were very friendly but service was just a bit too slow and some items werent available at the time still it was a special experience for my mums birthday read more report helpful open table diner london10 dined on 14 february 2018food is terrible and expensive it was a really bad experience for valentines day report helpful aidan london50 dined on 12 february 2018great space to experience london views at a reasonable price came here to celebrate my sisters 50th and restaurant space and experience didn’t disappoint food was mixed very small portions but some were tasty eg the cod but others not such as the risotto although staff were great they all seemed extremely stressed and food service took over 2 hours for a 2 course meal i’d definitely go back but probably prefer sitting at the bar it’s a shame there aren’t more areas to allow you to snap pictures  most of the windows are lined with tables so not easy to catch an awesome shot host apologised for delay in food service read more report helpfulsw19 london20 dined on 11 february 2018i would only recommend aquashard for a drink at the bar so you can take in the view but the food is not up to par and the service is below average report helpful victor l london10 dined on 11 february 2018waited 2 hours for the starter waiters are checking themselves in the mirror and we had to ask for everything  water bread and our order we asked for bread three times having waited an hour but our request seemed to have been continually forgotten other customers were also complaining pouring their own wine and leaving early without eating their main and dessert the starter when it eventually came was tasteless and the presentation was awful we also had to ask for the soup which was supposed to come with the brunch starter this appalling customer service is nowhere near worth the prices stated please for your own good stay away from this restaurant read more report helpful open table diner tampa40 dined on 11 february 2018the view and ambiance are stunning and the entire experience was worth it just for that some dishes were terrific and others were subpar such as the beef dish which we had to send back the service was extremely poor there were not enough staff for the tables and it took us 4 hours for lunch we do understand they did not want to rush us but there were many many many points where we were looking around for attention when we tried to pay we ended up standing up and leaving with our coats hoping to grab someones attention read more report helpful open table diner miami10 dined on 10 february 2018we waited for more than

thebeast london30 dined on 31 january 2018you only go to this restaurant for the view  or if youre a tourist i eat out for business meals all over london and this place and all the restaurants in the shard feel plastic with no atmosphere first the positives  food is good service is sharp and the view is awesome i need more than just that the food is eyewateringly expensive and if you go for the cheaper set menu then the food is dull and unimaginative the menu itself is not at all extensive the wine list is just ridiculously expensive which also wasnt a shock theres no ambience and you feel like youre in a posh greenhouse there is no value fro money and no value of experience feels a bit like a theme park experience with no theme just a bit shallow and naff read more report helpful open
