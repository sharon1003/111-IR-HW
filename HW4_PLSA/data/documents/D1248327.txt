previous solar midnight sunrise solar noon sunset and the next solar midnight the day twilights civil nautical and astronomical and night are indicated by the color bands from yellow to gray the transitions to and from daylight saving time are indicated by the dst labels humidity we base the humidity comfort level on the dew point as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin thereby cooling the body lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid unlike temperature which typically varies significantly between night and day dew point tends to change more slowly so while the temperature may drop at night a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night the chance that a given day will be muggy in split is essentially constant during march remaining around 0 throughout for reference on august 12 the muggiest day of the year there are muggy conditions 9 of the time while on november 18 the least muggy day of the year there are muggy

highly dependent on local topography and other factors and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages the average hourly wind speed in split is gradually decreasing during march decreasing from 100 miles per hour to 95 miles per hour over the course of the month for reference on february 4 the windiest day of the year the daily average wind speed is 103 miles per hour while on june 16 the calmest day of the year the daily average wind speed is 69 miles per hour average wind speed in march the average of mean hourly wind speeds dark gray line with 25th to 75th

percentage of hours in which the mean wind direction is from each of the four cardinal wind directions north east south and west excluding hours in which the mean wind speed is less than 1 mph the lightly tinted areas at the boundaries are the percentage of hours spent in the implied intermediate directions northeast southeast southwest and northwest water temperature split is located near a

sources this report illustrates the typical weather in split year round based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from january 1 1980 to december 31 2016 temperature and dew point there are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in split for each station the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and split according to the international standard atmosphere and by the relative change present in the merra2 satelliteera reanalysis between the two locations the estimated value at split is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between split and a given station the stations contributing to this reconstruction are split airport 81 12 kilometers west hvar airport 15 38 kilometers south mostar international airport 27 117 kilometers east and banja luka international airport 15 174 kilometers northeast other data all data relating to the suns position eg sunrise and sunset are computed using astronomical formulas from the book astronomical tables of the sun moon and planets by jean meeus all other weather data including cloud cover precipitation wind speed and direction and solar flux come from nasas merra2 modernera retrospective analysis this reanalysis combines a variety of widearea measurements in a stateoftheart global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50kilometer

made on the basis of the content presented on this site we draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the merra2 modelbased reconstructions for a number of important data series while having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness these reconstructions 1 are based on computer models that may have modelbased errors 2 are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates and 3 have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas especially small islands we further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable and that the definition of the scores reflects a
