and his family moved to new orleans his father abandoned the family when williams was just a year old and in 1959 williams moved with his mother to los angeles california and settled in the citys south central region  citation neededas williams mother worked several jobs to support them williams was a latchkey kid and often engaged in mischief on the streets he recalled that as a child he would hang out in abandoned houses and vacant lots around his neighborhood in south central where he would watch adults get drunk abuse drugs gamble and engage in pit bull fights williams stated that after the adults finished the dog fighting they would make the children fight each other including himself williams began to participate in these street fights regularly as a child where adults would bet on him and give him part of the proceeds for winning his fights williams was often the target of older bullies and street thugs in his neighborhood and by the age of twelve began carrying a switchblade in order to protect himself  citation needed by the time williams was a teenager he had gained a reputation in south centrals west side as a vicious street fighter williams was expelled from george washington preparatory high school and was blackballed by several other high schools in the south central area for fighting and eventually began doing stints in central juvenile hall gang activity  editin the late 1960s juvenile crime increased in south central as older gangs disbanded to join the black power movement most notably as part of the black panther party initially to protect black people from police brutality and corruption in the los angeles police department increasingly violent youth gangs formed in their place which williams initially despised as predatory but because of his viciousness and willingness to fight older youths williams earned the respect of many gangsters on the west side these gangs were mostly smalltime neighborhood cliques that operated independently from each other and leadership was not chosen but determined naturally at age fifteen williams was invited into a small west side clique after he befriended a local teenager donald docsweetback archie williams soon earned the cliques respect after beating up one of their members for insulting his mother and williams became the unofficial leader of this clique as his violent reputation began to spread across south central in 1969 at age sixteen williams was arrested in inglewood for car theft and was sent to the los padrinos juvenile hall in downey while doing time at the detention center williams was introduced to olympic weightlifting by the facilitys gym coach and this experience would spark an interest in bodybuilding by his released from custody in early 1971 aged seventeen williams was physically bigger and stronger according to williams upon his release from custody the review board asked him what he planned to do after being released to which he replied being the leader of the biggest gang in the world shortly after his release williams was approached by raymond washington at washington preparatory high school after hearing of williams through a mutual friend of both young men the friend had informed washington of williams toughness and his willingness to fight members of larger more established street gangs such as the l a brims and the chain gang according to williams account of his the meeting what struck him about washington was that besides being incredibly muscular he and his cohort were dressed similar to williams and his clique wearing leather jackets with starched levis jeans and suspenders washington was from south centrals east side where he was a prominent gangster similar to williams and proposed they use their influence in their respective regions to form the larger crips street gang the purpose for creating the gang initially was to eliminate all street gangs and create a bull force neighborhood watch in south central williams said we started out—at least my intent was to in a sense address all of the socalled neighboring gangs in the area and to put in a sense—i thought i can cleanse the neighborhood of all these you know marauding gangs but i was totally wrong and eventually we morphed into the monster we were addressing 2 washington himself has stated that he founded the crips not with the intention of eliminating other gangs but to create a force powerful enough to protect local black people from racism corruption and brutality at the hands of the police at the time of the crips initial formation there were only three crip sets washingtons east side crips later called east coast crips williams west side crips and the compton crips led by a teenager named mac thomas williams formed the west side crips using his own influence having befriended so many clique leaders and street thugs on the west side washington williams and thomas went on an aggressive and violent recruitment campaign throughout the black ghettos of los angeles where they challenged the leaders of other gangs to oneonone street fights this process resulted in most gangs agreeing to join the crips and they were converted from small independent cliques into subgroups  sets of a gang within the larger gang the crips quickly became the biggest street gang in south central by both numbers and territory however numerous gangs still resisted losing their independence these holdout gangs formed a similar alliance to combat the crips influence branding themselves as the bloods and would become their fiercest rivals williams former rivals the l a brims and the chain gang joined the blood alliance and became the brims and the inglewood family bloods respectively as leader of the west side crips williams became the archetype of the new wave of los angeles gang members that would engage in random acts of violence against rival gang members and innocent people alike williams and his best friend curtis buddha morrow would noticeably participate in these activities striking fear into both street criminals and the residents of south central watts inglewood and compton williams violent acts became legendary in southern los angeles criminal underworld as on numerous occasions criminal charges brought against him ended in disarray and prosecutors were unable to convict him due to lack of evidence crips leader  edithowever soon after the foundation of the crips other leaders were either murdered or incarcerated and williams was regarded as the de facto leader in 1974 raymond washington was arrested for 2nd degree robbery and served five years in prison in tracy and soon after was murdered on february 23 1973 curtis buddha morrow was shot to death in south central following a petty argument mac thomas was murdered under mysterious circumstances in the mid1970s williams began to live an ironic double life where he worked a legal job as as a youth counselor in compton while also serving as the overboss for one of the largest gangs in los angeles williams would work as a counselor and study sociology at compton college during working hours then spend his free time participating in numerous violent attacks against the bloods in 1976 williams was wounded in a driveby shooting while sitting on the porch of his house in compton the shooting was committed by members of the bloods who shot at williams from their car as he was letting his dog out for a walk in the evening attempting to avoid getting hit williams dived to the ground from the porch but was shot in both of his legs williams was told by doctors that he would never walk again but after nearly yearlong process of physical rehabilitation and an intense workout regimen he ultimately regaining his ability to walk after the shooting williams redeveloped a substance abuse problem when he began smoking pcp williams had began dabbling in street drugs around the age of twelve and as a preteen befriended a neighborhood pimp who in return for performing errands for him the pimp would reward williams with money and drugs particularly quaaludes barbiturates then known as red devils or marijuana williams personal life began to unravel his maternal grandmother with whom he was very close died in 1976 he lost his counseling job in 1977 after being implicated in a robbery that was committed by two youths from a group home that williams supervised he was denied an opportunity to compete in an amateur bodybuilding contest after it was discovered that he was a gang leader williams would later appear on the 1970s variety show the gong show performing a posedown routine eventually his gangster lifestyle was beginning to take a mental toll on him which included a brief stay in the psychiatric ward of a hospital after williams experienced a bad trip while high on pcp with each of these setbacks williams increasingly found himself using pcp and supported his drug habit by intimidating and robbing drug dealers in south central murder convictions  editin 1979 williams was convicted of four counts of murder committed in two of three separate incidents williams always maintained his innocence though subsequent court reviews concluded that there was no compelling reason to grant a retrial the prosecution stated that williams met with a man identified in court documents only as darryl late on tuesday evening february 28 1979 3 williams introduced darryl to friends of his alfred blackie coward and to bernard whitie trudeau and a short time after the initial meeting darryl driving a brown station wagon and accompanied by williams and coward drove to the home of james garret williams frequently stayed and kept some possessions at garrets home including a 12gauge shotgun and after about 10 minutes inside williams returned with the shotgun williams darryl and coward then went to the home of tony sims in pomona where they discussed possible locations to obtain money through robbery afterwards they went to another residence where williams left the others and returned with a 22caliber pistol and placed it in the station wagon darryl and williams entered the station wagon coward and sims entered another vehicle and then embarked on the freeway both vehicles exited the california state route 72 freeway along whittier boulevard the first incident occurred at a nearby stopngo supermarket where darryl and sims at the request of williams entered the store with the apparent intention of robbing it darryl was carrying the 22 pistol that williams had deposited in the station wagon earlier and also had a rifle in the trunk of the car along with two semiautomatic handguns the clerk at the stopngo market johnny garcia had just finished mopping the floor when he observed a station wagon and the four men at the door to the market two of the men entered the market and one of the men went down an aisle while the other approached garcia asking for a cigarette garcia gave the man a cigarette and lit it for him after approximately three to four minutes the men left the market without carrying out the planned robbery the prosecution stated that next coward and sims followed williams and darryl to the 7eleven market located at 10437 whittier boulevard in whittier where the second incident occurred the store clerk 26yearold albert lewis owens was sweeping the stores parking lot at 742 pm when darryl and sims entered the 7eleven owens put the broom and dustpan he was using on the hood of his car and entered the store to serve them and was followed in by williams and coward as darryl and sims walked to the counter area to take money from the cash register williams walked behind owens pulled the shotgun from under his jacket and told owens to shut up and keep walking 3 while pointing the shotgun at owens’ back williams directed him to a back storage room and ordered him to lie down coward said that he next heard the sound of a round being chambered into the shotgun then heard a shot and glass breaking followed by two more shots he shot at a security monitor and then killed owens shooting him twice in the back at pointblank range as he lay prone on the storage room floor 4the third incident occurred at the brookhaven motel located at 10411 south vermont avenue in south central los angeles which was run by 76yearold yenyi yang and his wife 63year old tsaishai c yang their daughter 43yearold yuchin yang lin and their son robert the yangs were immigrants from taiwan and yuchin had recently joined in the united states to run the hotel according to the prosecutors at approximately 500 am on march 11 1979 williams entered the brookhaven motel lobby and then broke down the door that led to the private office inside the office williams shot and killed yenyi tsaishai and yuchin after which he emptied the cash register and fled the scene robert asleep with his wife in their bedroom at the motel was awakened by the sound of somebody breaking down the door to the motel’s office shortly thereafter he heard a female scream followed by gunshots robert entered the motel office and found that his mother his sister and his father had all been shot and the cash register was empty the forensic pathologist testified that yenyi yang suffered two close range shotgun wounds one to his left arm and abdomen and one to the lower left chest tsaishai also received two close range wounds one to the tailbone and the other to the front of the abdomen entering at the navel yuchin yang lin was shot once in the upper left face area at a distance of a few feet witnesses testified that williams referred to the victims in conversations with friends as  buddha heads 5trial  editstanley williams was convicted in 1979 of all four murders with special circumstances on each count of felony murder robbery as well as multiple murder in the case of the brookhaven event the jury also convicted him of robbery in both cases and found that he personally used a firearm in the commission of the crimes the jury returned a verdict of guilty and the judge sentenced him to death 6from the beginning of his sentence williams maintained his innocence regarding the four murders alleging prosecutorial misconduct exclusion of exculpatory evidence ineffective assistance of counsel biased jury selection and the misuse of jailhouse and government informants 7 williams claimed that the police found not a shred of tangible evidence no fingerprints no crime scenes of bloody boot prints they didnt match my boots nor eyewitnesses even the shotgun shells found conveniently at each crime scene didnt match the shotgun shells that i owned however the prosecutions firearms expert a sheriffs deputy testified during trial that the shotgun shell recovered from the brookhaven motel crime scene matched test shells from the shotgun owned by stanley williams no second examiner verified his findings and the defense claimed this experts methodology was  junk science at best 8 williams gun was found in the home of a couple with whom he occasionally stayed according to the district attorney the husband was undergoing sentencing for receiving stolen property and tried for extortion williams lawyers have claimed that the district attorney quashed a murder investigation in exchange for their testimony the two shells recovered from the 7eleven crime scene were consistent with shells fired from this gun with no exclusionary markings the shell recovered from the brookhaven motel crime scene was conclusively matched to williams weapon to the exclusion of all other firearms 3critics claim that although he renounced gangs and apologized for his role in cofounding the crips williams continued to associate with crips members in prison however when contacted about williams alleged ongoing gang activity los angeles police department spokeswoman april harding said there was no evidence of his gang leadership opponents also pointed out that he received a significant amount of money from outside sources they stated that people who appreciate williams work sent him money its as simple as that said williams spokeswoman barbara becnel 9the prosecution had removed three black people from serving as jurors in williams trial williams lawyers claimed that he was convicted by a jury that had no africanamericans one latino one filipinoamerican and 10 white americans 10 the district attorney provided proof however in the form of a death certificate and the affidavit of another juror that juror 12 william james mc lurkin was black 3 the defense responded that contrary to the affidavit mc lurkin did not appear black they maintain that the trial record indicates that none of the lawyers and particularly the prosecutor additional evidence in a november 2005 petition for clemency the defense however has neither stated whether or not his mother was actually filipina nor refuted the evidence that mc lurkin was black 8 according to the clemency petition in his closing arguments prosecuting district attorney robert martin described williams as a  bengal tiger in captivity in a zoo and said that the jury needed to imagine him in his natural habitat which was like going into the back country into the hinterlands in a radio interview martin insisted that the analogy was not meant to be racial and instead was a metaphor to the fact that williams appeared in court dressed in business attire much like an animal in a zoo appears more docile than it would be in the wild 11 in the court of appeal summary of the case williams stated that various jurors misconstrued as a threat a question that he asked defense counsel at the close of the guilt phase the trial record shows that after the jurors returned their guilty verdicts williams said sons of bitches in a voice sufficiently loud that the court reporter included it in the trial transcript on the day that the jury began its penaltyphase deliberations an alternate juror reported to the bailiff that he was going to get all of them 12 13   §212 et ciewilliams became inmate cdc c29300 at san quentin state prison in northern california and spent 6 years in solitary confinement in the late 1980s for multiple assaults on guards and fellow inmates 3 14 15 according to a classification report found on page 8 of filings by his lawyers during the clemency proceedings dated august 5 2004 williams had no violations since that time 16appeals  edittookie williams appealed his conviction in the state courts and filed a petition in the federal courts for habeas corpus relief the state courts affirmed the conviction and the lower federal court denied the habeas corpus petition in 2001 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit heard williams appeal from the lower federal court and the appellate court denied williams appeal in 2002 but noted that the federal courts were not his only forum for relief and that he could request clemency from the governor of california  citation needed in late 2005 a campaign began to urge governor arnold schwarzenegger to grant clemency for williams in consideration of his work as an antigang activist with thousands of people signing online petitions calling for schwarzenegger to commute the death sentence in early november 2005 williams attorneys filed his formal petition for executive clemency as well as a motion to obtain new evidence see below for the full text of the documents filed in these proceedings california opposed the clemency petition through the office of the los angeles county district attorney who along with the los angeles police department and other law enforcement groups disputed that williams had in fact reformed they stated that he refused to inform official on other gang members or the tactics and communication methods that the gangs used as williams said he did not want to be a  snitch  17 the clemency petition emphasized the theme of williams redemption and rehabilitation rather than his claim of actual innocence the san francisco chronicle writer bob egelko doubted this method based on the courts handling the appeals and quoted austin sarat professor of law and politics at amherst college and author of mercy on trial a book about clemency its actual innocence about the only ground in which governors grant clemency in the modern period i know of no case in which a death row inmate has been spared solely on the basis of postconviction rehabilitation 18on december 8 2005 governor schwarzenegger held a clemency hearing at a onehour closeddoor meeting where a crowd consisting of both supporters of williams and proponents of capital punishment congregated outside the california state capitol in sacramento schwarzenegger described the decision whether to grant clemency as the toughest thing when you are governor dealing with someones life while the clemency petition was pending before the governor williams also filed further appeals in the courts on november 30 2005 the california supreme court in a 43 decision refused to reopen williams case 19 on december 11 2005 the california supreme court denied williams request for a stay of execution supporters of williams also made another plea directly to governor schwarzenegger to stay the execution 20also during this period the media community organizations and relatives of the victims were speaking out in midnovember 2005 talk show hosts john and ken of the john and ken show on clear channel s kfi radio in los angeles started a tookie must die for killing four innocent people hour on their show daily until the execution of williams in the hour they interviewed advocates of both sides of the issue and expressed their support of the impending execution

n s w e r and others tookies friend coauthor and political collaborator barbara becnel helped to spearhead much of the organizing celebrities also joined to stop the execution including snoop dogg who appeared at a clemency rally wearing a shirt advertising the save tookie website and performed a song he had written for williams jamie foxx noting that williams execution date was his birthday publicly stated that the only birthday present he wanted was clemency for williams other prisoners were also involved in activism to save williamss life including tony ford whose death sentence in a disputed case was indefinitely stayed helped organize a prisoners strike in texas protesting the execution  citation needed ref httptexasmoratoriumorgarticlephpsid1047 ref on november 29 2005 the american civil liberties union of northern california announced that more than 175000 californians had signed a petition requesting the temporary suspension of executions in california until the california commission on the fair administration of justice could complete its study due for december 31 2007 21 the california moratorium on executions act a b1121 was scheduled to have its first hearing in january 2006 press conferences and rallies in more than a dozen california cities called for a halt to all executions and asked governor schwarzenegger to commute williams’ death sentence to life without parole on december 8 2005 lora owens the stepmother of albert owens made a statement expressing her opinion of stanley williams i think he williams is the same coldblooded killer that he was then and he would be now if he had the opportunity again 22 owens two daughters rebecca and andrea who were 8 and 5 yearsold when their father was murdered also opposed clemency and recalled that they were shocked when they had learned that their fathers murderer was nominated for a nobel peace prize 23 by contrast on december 9 2005 linda owens albert owens widow issued a statement in support of williams’ efforts to bring an end to gang violence and his call for peace between gangs i linda owens want to build upon mr williams peace initiative i invite mr williams to join me in sending a message to all communities that we should all unite in peace this position of peace would honor my husbands memory and mr williams work 24on december 12 2005 governor schwarzenegger denied clemency for williams in his denial governor schwarzenegger cited the followingthe possible irregularities in williams trial have been thoroughly and carefully reviewed by the courts and there is no reason to disturb the judicial decisions that uphold the jurys decisions that he is guilty of these four murders and should pay with his life the basis of his request for clemency is the personal redemption stanley williams has experienced and the positive impact of the message he sends yet it is impossible to separate williams claim of innocence from his claim of redemption cumulatively the evidence demonstrating williams is guilty of these murders is strong and compelling … there is no reason to second guess the jurys decision of guilt or raise significant doubts or serious reservations about williams convictions and death sentence williams has written books that instruct readers to avoid the gang lifestyle and to stay out of prison … he has also … tried to preach a message of gang avoidance and peacemaking … it is hard to assess the effect of such efforts in concrete terms but the continued pervasiveness of gang violence leads one to question the efficacy of williams message the dedication of williams book life in prison casts significant doubt on his personal redemption… the mix of individuals on the dedication list is curious … but the inclusion of george jackson on the list defies reason and is a significant indicator that williams is not reformed and that he still sees violence and lawlessness as a legitimate means to address societal problems is williams redemption complete and sincere or is it just a hollow promise stanley williams insists he is innocent and that he will not and should not apologize or otherwise atone for the murders of the four victims in this case without an apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings there can be no redemption in this case the one thing that would be the clearest indication of complete remorse and full redemption is the one thing williams will not do governor schwarzenegger summarized by basing his denial of clemency on the totality of circumstances 25 on the same day the schwarzenegger denied williams clemency jonathan harris a new york counsel with curtis malletprevost colt  mosle llp filed a response summarizing new evidence of innocence 26 it included reference to an affidavit by gordon bradbury von ellerman attesting to belief in williams innocence dated december 10 it states that he called the naacp on december 8 after reading in the daily breeze that his cellmate george oglesby had testified against williams he states that he had observed oglesby receive police reports on williams and others mr oglesby told von ellerman that he was using the documents to testify against williams and others to gain a reduction or eliminate charges against him von ellerman also observed oglesby copying from samples of williams handwriting to create incriminating documents that would appear to be written by mr williams 27 prosecutors had cited handwritten notes written by williams about an escape plan which involved the killing of a bus driver and another accomplice 3execution  editsan quentin state prison where williams was incarcerated and executed on december 13 2005 after exhausting all forms of appeal williams was executed by lethal injection at san quentin state prison newsweek reported thousands of protesters outside most of whom were seeking williams clemency he was the 12th person to be executed by the state of california following the 1976 u s supreme court decision of gregg v georgia  citation needed williams provided no last words to the prison warden but in an interview on wbai pacifica radio hours before the execution he stated 28my lack of fear of this barbaric methodology of death i rely upon my faith it has nothing to do with machismo with manhood or with some pseudo former gang street code this is pure faith and predicated on my redemption so therefore i just stand strong and continue to tell you your audience and the world that i am innocent and yes i have been a wretched person but i have redeemed myself and i say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailormade for the wretched and thats what i used to be…thats what i would like the world to remember me thats how i would like my legacy to be remembered as a redemptive transition something that i believe is not exclusive just for the socalled sanctimonious the elitists and it doesnt—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or ones religious background its accessible for everybody thats the beauty about it and whether others choose to believe that i have redeemed myself or not i worry not because i know and god knows and you can believe that all of the youths that i continue to help they know too so with that i am grateful…i say to you and everyone else god bless so take care witnesses described the mood in the execution chamber as somber and williams showed no resistance as he was led into the execution chamber after williams was strapped to the gurney he struggled against the straps holding him down to look up at the press gallery behind him and to exchange glances with his supporters williamss advocate and editor barbara becnel was also a witness to his execution in the epilogue of williamss reprinted memoir blue rage black redemption becnel reported that prior to williamss arrival in the death chamber he had promised her that he would find a way to lift his head and smile at me at some point during his execution no matter what was being done to him and that is exactly what he did 29 williams then rested his head on the gurney while medical technicians began inserting needles in his veins although cnn reported the staff had difficulty inserting the needles and the usuallyshort process took almost 20 minutes 30contra costa times reporter john simerman added they had some trouble with the second i v which was in the left arm… williams at one point grimaced or looked almost out of frustration…at the difficulty there…he had his glasses on the whole time he kept them on and he kept looking… with a look of frustration on his face williams angrily asked the technicians you guys doing that right a female guard whispered to him and a second guard patted williams shoulder as if to comfort him williams shed one silent tear but otherwise showed no emotion as he was executed 31 members of albert owens family who witnessed the execution were described as stonyfaced however lora owens appeared very upset according to msnbc anchor rita cosby kevin fagan a reporter for the san francisco chronicle wrote a detailed description of the execution 31this is the sixth one i have seen here at san quentin and i have to say this was very different the most notable thing was that williams had supporters at the back of the room… mrs becnel was among them i understand we could see them and throughout the last part of the execution—or preparing him when he was still conscious they gave what looked like black power salutes several times to him one man and two women and most strikingly at the end of the execution as those three were heading out they yelled the state of california just killed an innocent man which is the first time i ever heard any outburst in the death
