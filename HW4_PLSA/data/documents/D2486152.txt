is nothing healthy about these bars proceed with cautionthese lemon coconut gooey butter bars will give you lifeby the time you read this post i will be on my way to gattlinburg tennessee aside from me desperately needing a vacation i am leaving because i know that some of you will want to hunt me down and scream my head off because of how good these bars look right now and you know you shouldn’t be eating these bars well you are going to have to catch me when i come back…if you can by the time i come back from my vacation let’s face it you would’ve eat an entire pan of these bars gained 5 pounds and started making another batch already i know i know they are stupid good i wanted to make these bars because i have heard and seen the infamous ooey gooey bars made by paula deen several times so i just had to make them myself well they are ooey and definitely gooey i understand why people love these bars as i was making them i became conflicted with my emotions i didn’t know whether to feel excited because i was making them or horrified because of the amounts of butter that went into the recipe at first i was horrified that i would immediately gain 5 pounds with one bite and have instant diabetes but when i tried one i was so happy and that horrified feeling went away quicklythere are some things in life worth dying for and these lemon coconut gooey butter bars are definitely worth the deep sleepsoooooooo……i wanted to give these bars a different twist which is where the lemon and coconut came from i think paula would approve of these lemon coconut gooey butter bars but first i must tell paula deen how much i love this recipe despite the calories fat and sugar she is a pure genius anyway so i would continue typing but i have to get rest for my vacation starting tomorrow i just wanted to share with these with you because i know that you will appreciate them and me for giving the recipe to you see you when i get back  recipe partially adapted from paula deen

at 227 pm i didn’t read all the comments so i apologize if my question has already been answered i was wondering what size eggs to use for this recipe i don’t use cake mix i don’t even know how to i’d like to put together my own dry ingredients then add the other stuff also i’ll be tweaking the recipe a little by using coconut cream concentrate i’ll be mixing it with the melted butter first as it will seize up if it gets in with ingredients that are too cool i might even try putting in less white sugar and adding some cream of coconut i think i’ll try the recipe your way first just to see how it’s supposed to be then i’ll mess around with it i love gooey desserts and this one’s got some uber lemoncoconut gooeyness going on reply nicole naredwashington says october 21 2015 at 134 pm i used
