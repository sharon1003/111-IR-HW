the colon it is called a diverticulum a diverticulum is not to be confused with a growth or a tumor you can think of it like a fold but in the shape of a small berry or pouch that bulges from the colon when there are more than one diverticulum they are called diverticula someone who is diagnosed with diverticula is said to have diverticulosis diverticulosis is common among people who are 45 years of age and above it is estimated that about 30 percent of those above 45 and as much as 70 percent of people older than 85 years in the us alone have diverticulosis however an increasing number of younger people are also diagnosed with this condition especially those who are obese symptoms of diverticulosis diverticulosis usually occurs in the lower descending portion of the colon which is on the left side of the abdomen although it may also happen on the right side many people with diverticulosis are totally unaware of it because they usually do not feel any discomfort and therefore may not require any treatment however some individuals have also reported intermittent mild pain in the lower left abdomen changes in their bowel habits or persistent bloating as a result of the condition in some rare cases diverticula may also bleed since the symptoms of diverticulosis are common and are shared by other gastrointestinal diseases a thorough medical examination which may involve ct scan andor ultrasound is needed to diagnose the condition accurately what is diverticulitis diverticulitis describes the condition where the small bulges diverticula in the lining of the colon are inflamed and infected some ten to 25 percent of people with diverticulosis will develop diverticulitis simple diverticulitis can usually be resolved with a course of antibiotics but when the infection is left untreated and does not clear up by itself a collection of pus called abscess in the colon may be created an unresolved abscess would spread and infect surrounding healthy colon tissue and even puncture a hole through the colon wall if the hole is large enough pus and waste will leak out of the colon and contaminate the abdominal cavity leading to an inflammation of the peritoneum peritonitis — a potentially fatal condition that requires immediate medical attention another type of complication called fistula may also occur when infected diverticula spread outside the colon in this case a fistula which describes an abnormal tract between two organs which shouldn’t be connected is formed when the infected part of the colon sticks to a nearby organ such as the small intestine bladder or skin this may cause chronic inflammation to the affected organs lastly diverticula inflammation may also lead to partial or total obstruction of the colon due to the swelling and narrowing of the bowel wall collectively diverticulosis and diverticulitis are known as colonic diverticular disease symptoms of diverticulitis symptoms of diverticulitis depend on the severity of the condition they may include acute sharp abdominal pain andor localized tenderness on the lower left abdomen some people may also experience fever vomiting nausea constipation or diarrhea diverticulitis may also lead to bleeding in the colon what causes diverticular disease despite advances in medical research we still know very little about the exact cause of diverticular disease but scientists suspect that the following conditions may contribute to its occurrence insufficient fiber when there is not enough dietary fiber stool becomes less bulky and requires more contraction of the colon to move this would lead to higher pressure especially at the sigmoid colon the ending part of the large intestine before the rectum and anus and promotes the occurrence of diverticulosis in the gut constipation when there is constipation more force is required to move the bowel the increased pressure however can cause some parts of the colon that are weaker to deform and bulge out sedentary lifestyle physical exercise may help to move stool quicker through the colon and hence giving less chance for diverticula to form old age diverticular disease is more common among those above 45 years old although the exact reason is unknown the prevalence could be a result of multiple factors including weaken colonic wall agerelated wear and tear and decreased mobility abdominal obesity a high accumulation of fat around the waist is linked to acute diverticulitis in younger obese adults according to a study conducted by the university of maryland medical center does diverticulitis diet help if you are diagnosed with diverticulitis what should you eat to prevent another diverticulitis attack previously it was thought that tiny foodstuff like corn seeds nuts and popcorn would trigger a diverticulitis attack but research seems to suggest otherwise in fact based on a preliminary study published in the journal of the american medical association in 2007 eating nuts and seeds twice a week may even help to prevent diverticulitis though the reason is unclear here is one suggestion to consider to prevent diverticulitis attacks one way is to include fresh foods that are antiinflammatory nutrientdense minimally processed read highfiber and that you are not allergic or sensitive to these could include salmon choose wild alaskan salmon if possible spinach sweet potatoes ginger papaya and other bright color vegetables and fruits it is also equally important to avoid foods that are inflammatory too to reduce the chances of diverticulitis flareups these culprits are quite easy to spot they are usually found in readytocook packages in a box don’t look anything like real foods and are often impregnated with hydrogenated vegetable oil and trans fats but what if you just had a diverticulitis attack in this case you may need to stick to a liquid diet and totally abstain from highfiber foods for a period of time to prevent aggravating the inflammation in the colon when your condition eases fibrous foods may be reintroduced slowly before going back to your normal diet discuss with your physician on the exact foods that you should and should not take during the
