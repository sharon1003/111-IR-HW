government no matter who wins the presidency the ‘deep state’ will run things when crunch time has come our deep state has managed largely to keep the ship afloat and chugging ahead they’ll see us through either hillary clinton or donald trump by james poulos july 19 2016as the planet tips toward chaos who will chart our course in the world as we careen toward clinton versus trump who will save america people in growing numbers are edging toward the unthinkable answer nobody not just nihilists or conspiracists are thinking this way evidence is mounting that it’s prudent to consider the worst—that barack obama will hand a legacy of domestic and international disorder to a successor unprepared and unable to compensate meanwhile neither america’s public elites nor its populist commoners have secured broadbased confidence without an even more destabilizing revolution who can assert control you may not like it but there’s an answer the deep state what’s that ask exgop staffer mike lofgren author of “the deep state the fall of the constitution and the rise of a shadow government” “the key institutions are exactly what people would think they are” he recently explained  “the militaryindustrial complex the pentagon and all their contractors but also now our entire homeland security apparatus the department of treasury the justice department certain courts like the southern district of manhattan and the eastern district of virginia the fisa courts”even a few elected officials are in on the game “you got this kind of rump congress that consists of certain people in the leadership defense and intelligence committees who kind of know what’s going on the rest of congress doesn’t really know or care they’re too busy looking about the next election”like obama trump and clinton need the deep state it’s hard for any libertyloving american not to look at deepstaters as bad guys but they are the ultimate adults in the room they are the ones president obama has stiffarmed on foreign policy his most successful war has been waged against their influence—expanding his national security council to an absurd degree reaching down the chain of military command with unprecedented interference from the white house and bottlenecking strategic decisions with the innermost ring of his inner circle without doubt obama has given plenty of leeway to those who pay the deep state’s bills and make the trains run on time—wall street and silicon valley but obama owns the choices that have accelerated our race to the brink the mismanagement of mideast geopolitics the blindness to europe’s gathering storms the naivety toward russia the deep state is eager to reassert influence over our old world policy before events spiral further out of hand for right now there’s no one better to entrust it to donald trump certainly can’t fix things the evidence suggests he doesn’t want to not personally viewing his wouldbe white house role as a sort of chairman of the board who would hand expert stuff to the experts plus whatever may be said of trump he certainly does not wish to go down in history as the man who led us to world war three the same goes for hillary clinton her track record on world leadership is shaky her distaste for obama’s approach is clear and her lack of popularity will give her little margin for error as president as she shores up her domestic position and works to salvage what she has inherited a president clinton will desperately need the deep state to earn its keep the deep state is us to be sure in other parts of the world it’s an inauspicious moment for deep states just look at turkey whose deep state has held sway for decades on end there as the new yorker described it back when recep tayyip erdogan was considered a moderate the turkish deep state comprised a “clandestine network of military officers and their civilian allies who for decades suppressed and sometimes murdered dissidents communists reporters islamists christian missionaries and members of minority groups—anyone thought to pose a threat to the secular order established in 1923 by mustafa kemal or atatürk” now as erdogan turns the full brunt of his islamist power against that network it’s easy to worry that at this global juncture popular rage—and those who manipulate it—can outstrip the ability of seasoned power brokers to stay on top as usual however america is uniquely better off our deep state is not as deeply divided from our people by tribe politics or creed what differences do exist are manifest but as one linkedin maestro  peter thiel has noted we live in an era of the convergence of desire when our richest and most powerful tend toward seeking little more than topshelf versions of what everyone else seeks and enjoys our deep staters aren’t witches they’re us—only with the tools to keep our ship of state afloat that we unfortunately lack like ‘em or not they’ve done it before they helped us survive nixon’s meltdown carter’s haplessness and depending on how you judge more recent presidents other instances of foolishness when crunch time has come our deep state has managed largely to keep the ship afloat and chugging ahead it’s come to this however far afield we’ve drifted from our constitutional smallr republican moorings however justified our populist ire toward the staggering failures of our elites it’s wise and reasonable to rely on the deep state to see us through today’s darkly uncertain times indeed we ought to insist upon it after all even if we can’t yet dislodge our shadow government they still work for us unfortunately enough for all our populism too many—regardless of ideology—would really prefer that the deep and shallow state alike go well beyond working for us and simply do our work for us as yuval levin has recently reminded us and tocqueville once warned the sad irony of american politics is that individualism—with so many feeling weak isolated and insubstantial on their own—tends to discourage selfgovernment as the declaration of independence makes clear all the selfinterest and selfmastery in the world cannot achieve what mutual pledges and sacred honor might some element of the deep state might understand this but the founding spirit will never define the whole tapping back into that free source of order is a job that can’t be outsourced to any elite james

scandal among many others demonstrates that the deep state can be politicized and weaponized the deep state is us means that we turned the irs on ourselves which is nonsense the fact is they are a group of unaccountable mandarins separate from the people walker • 1 year ago term limits would be better placed on appointed and hired officials and advisers than on those who are elected for precisely this reason mattse • 1 year ago congress gave away their power to the regulatory state because oversight got in the way of campaigning when they werent enjoying the perks at any time they could deauthorize the deep state but that would require cutting government and their own theoretic power mind baggage • 1 year ago at its best the deep state is a anchor to keep the country from heading off a cliff due to a personality or other temporary fixation or fad at its worse it will always spend more money than can ever reasonably be matched through taxes leading us to eventual insolvency im not a historian but im guessing that the deep state really became a force during and after world war ii eisenhower as he left the oval office warned us of the deep state the problem with the deep state is that it cannot last it is designed to implode the country through complexity and bankruptcy what the us and the rest of the world needs to do is reduce geopolitical complexity and return a largely network of peoples and free trade the economy is driven more by ideas and technology today than raw materials and land reducing the need for deep states one cant be a constitutionalloving conservative and be a big believer in the deep state it is the antithesis of what george washington wanted for our country guest • 1 year ago tech zilla • 1 year ago calling what eisenhower stated a warning is misleading because it insinuates it happened dispite his best efforts he never opposed it in any way he in fact ushered it in and then cynically let us know it would screw us until were forced into revolution thanks ike really sporting of you to give us a running head startkenlov • 1 year agoas the planet tips toward chaos good grief must reactionaries pepper every oped with ludicrous hyperbole about a nonexistent world on fire the planet is in much better shape than it has been for most of recorded history the vast majority of its citizens are living lives of unprecedented health wealth security and liberty i suppose stoking their paranoia is a proven way to get support from lowinfo voters but is victory really worth the price of sowing relentless fear and social tension robert smith • 1 year ago relax folks ive read these comment and some make a little sense others show paranoia and general distrust and fear the existence of a deep state is nothing more than the operations that keep this country functioning its that simple employees if you will governed by laws rules and regulations they are not elected but hired for their qualifications experience and well their resume relax when you go to sleep tonight their are people working 247 around the entire world watching monitoring and keeping this nation safe all sections of our country military government employees civilians etc this article only points out a few basic ideas hey folks relax deep state is not our big brotherits us kingdom ambassador • 1 year ago deep state  us  we the peopleism  humanism  disaster anythingsuch as the united states constitutionnot established upon yahwehs moral law as supreme is a recipe for disaster case in point the constitution republic that inevitably was destined for the precipice of moral depravity and destruction where she finds herself today the united states constitutional republic was destined to fall from its inception this is borne out in the following two passagesand every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it matthew 72627 every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand matthew 1225the house known as the constitutional republic was not built upon the rock of yahweh’s1 word but instead upon enlightenment and masonic concepts2 it began and continues as a divided housethe day is therefore approaching when the republic’s cup of iniquity will be full and yahweh’s longsuffering is exhausted at that time the republic will be subjected to his judgment like all nations before her built on sand she will cease to exist the question that remains is whether that generation’s christians will be prepared to build upon her ruins if not another ungodly nation will fill the void until finally a future generation of our posterity are prepared to erect a government and society upon yahweh’s righteousness as expressed in his triune moral law his commandments statutes and judgments it is therefore incumbent upon this and all intervening generations of christians to do everything in their power to help prepare for that future generation of christians to do it right eous the next timefor more see free online book a biblical constitution a scriptural replacement for secular government at httpwwwbibleversusconst then

breaking with the first commandment kingdom ambassador • 1 year ago thanks for helping to make my point bob • 1 year ago face palmdenys picard • 1 year ago yes i guess we should all take a pragmatic look at this and appreciate that the deep state is turning our presidents into pimps making us a nation of whores instead of citizens sell your passport to the deep state and get a free pass to financial sodomy and analingus i guess they have beaten democraqcy and we should just surrender take pleasure at being submisive enjoy government bondage practicesin fact we may believe that we depend

point but i think he left out a few important details about the deep state for instance the deep state which involved us in wwi and wwii in order to lead our country in the direction of collectivism for a future one world government infiltrated the state department and our monetary system in 1913 and they established and maintained control over our educational system over the past 100 years or so they have inserted their tentacles into every aspect of our lives at some point the militaryoilintelligence arm of the deep state think kissinger bush clinton et al  since these are the actors youre allowed to know aboutmeaning they arent the ones in charge at the top tied the us dollar to their own monetary interests when nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard and instead established it as the petrodollar now when the deep state wages wars for profit to steal resources and maintain control over the oil market they are in reality also fighting to keep the dollar afloat so in that sense they are working in our best interests but i would prefer that our dollar not be tied to the evil people who honor profits over lives at the end of the day the dollar is going to collapse simply because it is only backed and propped up by the forced buying and selling of oil using the dollar iraq libya iran and now syria are all targets of the deep state simply because they have been working out deals to sell their oil in currencies other than the dollar this is going to happen whether we want it to or not if hillary becomes president we will have wwiii and the dollar will collapse if trump is elected the dollar will collapse but perhaps he will work with china and russia instead of fighting against them to find the best way for the us to recover and move forward in a mutually beneficial waywe can find a place in the world and establish our security based on something other than death war and destruction it is possible but first we have to be able to see through the propaganda and rid ourselves and our ability to take care of our families from the evil individuals that have hijacked this country the near future is going to be ugly the only say we have in it is just how ugly tech zilla • 1 year ago this is the sickest and most rank example of elitism ive seen from an actual writer i only catch such rationalizations from the rare proud corporatists found on message boards first the deepstate dont work for the general interest and they are outright hostile to the working class public this confirms most americans nightmare its not reassuring to anybody except the transnational capitalist class for whom the state exists to serve if you look to the oligarchy and think phew at least they have it all under control your who were going to come after eventually their will be nothing you can do to avoid the wrath you rightly earned i recommend you study your history your empire is a corrupt sham and now everybody knows it56earlgrey • 1 year ago judging from what you wrote james and the essay at salon you reference the deep state is something different from the administrative state it is the competent nexus of the administrative state its buck sexton former cia analyst now talk show host tony snow fox news presenterpresidential press sec  mark levin former hud admin and ags office cos now talk show hostauthor hank paulson former goldman sachs exec and now former treasury secretary its experts and doers who flow in and out of federal government executive departments keeping the whole thing going despite the sclerotic and entrenched bureaucracy and the many many clueless political appointees they apply their expertise to government agencies they then move back to the private sector where they make serious money what i listed are merely the well known republican examples but this must be going on constantly and in many areas of government youre sort of making an argument similar to one of my often ignored observations that rather than being a nefarious corrupt opaque organization working against the interests of the america people the federal reserve board is actually saving our asses1 congress will not curtail its overspending nor even discuss it substantively 2 china never had a hope of keeping up with us borrowing they only own about 1 trillion of our treasury notes all foreign buyers together own less than 27 trillion 3 we have a 19 trillion debt 4 whos making up the difference theres not even a payroll savings plan anymore for crying out loud the fed of course theyre the ones keeping the governments lights on but any program of covering that much debt would undoubtedly mean run away inflation and an unstable wall street and yet inflation is under control more of less and wall street is doing fine enter the expertise of the deep government but lets not confuse it with a shadow government iran has a very real shadow government the us is far from that sort of arrangement however i believe wed almost be better off not having these experts moving in to save the day check that wed definitely be better off but few of my fellow citizens would think so bob • 1 year agoworking for us and simply do our work for us stull humanistic in nature and subject to being fickle instead of a rock solid unchanging stance which we once walked in applying godly standards as the norm dog star • 1 year ago so big brother loves us does he i feel much better now2packs4sure  • 1 year ago speaking of the deep state httpwwwcfactorg201602packs4sure  • 1 year ago ive been making this argument for 30 years now thats why when no one is talking seriously about unraveling the deep state i get so discouraged i dont think trump has even mentioned it and its in the top 5 of what must be done james stagg • 1 year ago funnycrushlimbraw • 1 year ago this article today on da federalist actually makes some sense  the established bureaucracy runs the country now who is the most likely candidate to start tearing down this monstrous edifice this is the weakness of the article  hes misreading trump and who hasnt  but if trump doesnt begin to dismantle this monster and cut off its air supply it will kill us all eventually and thats the good news bureaucracy you betcha  httpcrushlimbrawblogspo dissident right • 1 year ago wrong we will destroy the deep state secession is coming the south will rise again can you feel itdanielwpeer • 1 year ago the deep state is not we the people the deep state is unelected beaureucrats that amount to a conspiracy to subvert the peoples will and enforce policy that was not implemented by an elected official of course the question then remains whos policies are they enforcing the deep states existence should trouble any freedom loving person i have a hard time believing this author is so obtuse that he doesnt realise this that implies that he is attempting to mislead people  such a shame chris gast • 1 year ago paradoxically freedom can only exist in an ordered society if you call 911 and nobody answers what is freedom what if you flip a light switch and nothing happens this is why libertarians will never win as wonderful as they can be they can let a utopian vision cloud out human nature sometimes what you are concerned about is the deep state dictating policy rather than keeping the lights on which may happen but it if does it will be because we utterly lack a wellordered society but a deep state is a necessary function for a civilization on some level without a deep state we would descend into anarchy or mob rule which is bad like a totalitarian regime the author could argue you are being obtuse wareagle82 • 1 year ago if you call 911 and nobody answers what is freedom what if you flip a light switch and nothing happens you act as if these things and others are only possible through the state power companies tend to be private concerns and would have every incentive in the world to ensure that something happens when the light switch is flipped i love when people condescendingly pat libertarians on the head as if theyre irrational children while ignoring how jacked up the current system is apparently you need the big state regulating what light bulb you can buy or how much water should flow when you flush or to tell you that the top rung on the ladder is not a step but most adults are able to add two and two and come up with four on their own the ones who cant are dems chris gast • 1 year ago theres a difference between regulating how much water you can use and maintaining the water lines the system has many problems but how can you say its seriously jacked up china is jacked up venezuela is jacked up somalia is jacked up america is not not yet anyway thats a central problem with libertarians is that you extend the idea that because a government shouldnt redesign your toilets they also shouldnt operate the public well the tragedy of the commons is a real phenomenon however and must be solved by collective action on some level too much reliance on collective action can bring you right back to the original problem of course you cant treat private actors and industry with the same reverence too many treat bureaucrats these same private actors freely choose the current jacked up system we havedanielwpeer • 1 year ago great replydanielwpeer • 1 year ago also freedom requires no such paradox freedom without order is called anarchy nor does order require a deep state both are assumptions on your part that amount to a failure of your teachers and yourself you should be ashamed that you dont know better further if no one answers when you call 911 people will do what they did before 911 existed except dems  theyll just complain about it chris gast • 1 year ago freedom can not exist in anarchy not as you think of freedom living in anarchy you would find most aspects of your life controlled with little room for your desires if you want to survive i contend that agents of the state utterly beholden to elected officials would descend into disorder quickly it should be good that there is some lethargy to check expansive state power imagine how bad it would get in countries like turkey if they didnt have enough lowlevel people in the deepstate to keep daily life continuing in the midst of political turmoil i dont think you really are calculating the human cost of doing away with 911danielwpeer • 1 year ago the author can make any argument he wants  there is no requirement that he must make a valid argument in order for it to be an argument the deep state is not needed at all and the author is trying to comfort trump and hillary haters by saying the deep state will protect us from their incompetence the problem is that such a thing basically amounts to a direct opposition to the will of the people if it werent so why arent any of these deep state people on the ballot chris gast • 1 year ago it would be impossible to do so we put local deep state people on the ballot and nobody cares to express their will on those positions who is your county clerk sheriff do you know without looking it up if you do great but how many of the people dopoest • 1 year ago nay the deep state is a subsidiary of the party of obama and clinton a la doj epa irs etc etc etc no the goal is to dismantle this insidious cancer
