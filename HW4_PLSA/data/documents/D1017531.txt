schizoaffective disorder also found in dictionary thesaurus legal acronyms encyclopedia wikipedia related to schizoaffective disorder borderline personality disorder schizoaffective disorder definition schizoaffective disorder is a mental illness that shares the psychotic symptoms of schizophreniaand the mood disturbances of depression or bipolar disorder description the term schizoaffective disorder was first used in the 1930s to describe patients with acutepsychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions along with disturbed mood thesepatients tended to function well before becoming psychotic their psychotic symptoms lastedrelatively briefly and they tended to do well afterward over the years however the termschizoaffective disorder has been applied to a variety of patient groups the current definitioncontained in the american psychiatric associations diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders iv dsmiv recognizes patients with schizoaffective disorder as those whose moodsymptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant a diagnosis of depression or other fullblown mooddisorder and whose mood symptoms overlap at some period with psychotic symptoms thatsatisfy the diagnosis of schizophrenia eg hallucinations delusions or thought processdisorder causes and symptoms the cause of schizoaffective disorder remains unknown and subject to continuing speculation some investigators believe schizoaffective disorder is associated with schizophrenia and may be caused by a similar biological predisposition others disagree stressing the disorderssimilarities to mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder manic depression they believe its more favorable course and less intense psychotic episodes are evidence thatschizoaffective disorder and mood disorders share a similar cause many researchers however believe schizoaffective disorder may owe its existence to bothdisorders these researchers believe that some people have a biologic predisposition to symptoms of schizophrenia that varies along a continuum of severity on one end of thecontinuum are people who are predisposed to psychotic symptoms but never display them on the other end of the continuum are people who are destined to develop outright schizophrenia in the middle are those who may at some time show symptoms of schizophrenia but require someother major trauma to set the progression of the disease into motion it may be an early braininjuryeither through a complicated delivery prenatal exposure to the flu virus or illicit drugs or it may be emotional nutritional or other deprivation in early childhood in this view major lifestresses or a mood disorder like depression or bipolar disorder may be sufficient to triggerthe psychotic symptoms in fact patients with schizoaffective disorder frequently experiencedepressed mood or mania within days of the appearance of psychotic symptoms someclinicians believe that schizomanic patients are fundamentally different from schizodepressedtypes the former are similar to bipolar patients while the latter are a very heterogeneous group symptoms of schizoaffective disorder vary considerably from patient to patient delusionshallucinations and evidence of disturbances in thinking—as observed in fullblown schizophrenia—may be seen similarly mood fluctuations such as those observed in major depression or bipolar disorder may also be seen these symptoms tend to appear in distinct episodes thatimpair the individuals ability to function well in daily life but between episodes some patientswith schizoaffective disorder remain chronically impaired while some may do quite well in daytoday living diagnosis there are no accepted tissue or brain imaging tests or techniques to diagnose schizophreniamood disorders or schizoaffective disorder instead physicians look for the hallmark signs andsymptoms of schizoaffective disorder described above and they attempt to rule out otherillnesses or conditions that may produce similar symptoms these include mania true manic patients can experience episodes of hallucinations and delusions similar to those seen in schizoaffective disorder but these do not persist for long periods after themania recedes as they do in schizoaffective disorder psychotic depression patients with psychotic depression experience hallucinations anddelusions similar to those seen in schizoaffective disorder but these symptoms do notpersist after the depressive symptoms recede as they do in schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia depressed mood mania or other symptoms may be present in patients withschizophrenia but patients with schizoaffective disorder will meet all the criteria set out for a fullblown mood disorder medical and neurological disorders that mimic psychoticaffective disorders treatment antipsychotic medications used to treat schizophrenia and the antidepressant drugs and moodstabilizers used in depression and bipolar disorder are the primary treatments for schizoaffectivedisorder unfortunately these treatments have not been well studied in controlled investigations studiessuggest that traditional antipsychotics such as haloperidol are effective in treating psychoticsymptoms newer generation antipsychotics such as clozaril and risperidone have not been as well studied but also appear effective for patients with symptoms of bipolar disorder lithium is often the mood stabilizer of choice and it is often augmented with an anticonvulsant such as valproate for those with depressive symptoms the evidence supporting the use of antidepressant medications in addition to antipsychotic medications is more mixed electroconvulsive therapy electric shock is frequently tried in patients who otherwise do notrespond to antidepressant or mood stabilizing drugs while the mainstay of treatment for schizoaffective disorder is antipsychotic medications andmood stabilizers certain forms of psychotherapy for both patients and family members can be useful therapy designed to provide structure and help augment patients ability to solveproblems may aid in improving patients ability to function in the daytoday world reducingstress and the risk of recurrence vocational and other rehabilitative training can help patients to work on skills they need to develop whereas hospitalization may be necessary for acutepsychotic episodes halfway houses and day hospitals can provide needed treatment whileserving as a bridge for patients to reenter the community alternative treatment while alternative therapies should never be considered a replacement for medication thesetreatments can help support people with schizoaffectve disorder and other mental illnesses dietary modifications that eliminate processed foods and emphasize whole foods along withnutritional supplementation may be helpful acupuncture homeopathy and botanical medicinecan support many aspects of the persons life and may help decrease the side effects of anymedications prescribed prognosis in general patients with schizoaffective disorder have a more favorable prognosis than do thosewith schizophrenia but a less favorable course than those with a pure mood disorder medicationand other interventions can help quell psychotic symptoms and stabilize mood in many patientsbut there is great variability in outcome from patient to patient prevention there is no known way to prevent schizoaffective disorder treatment with antipsychotic andmood stabilizing drugs may prevent recurrences some researchers believe prompt treatmentcan prevent the development of fullblown schizophrenia but this remains the subject of somedisagreement resources organizations american psychiatric association 1400 k street nw washington dc
