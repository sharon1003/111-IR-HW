a trick p h question return to the acid base menu heres the scenarioa youre given a hydrogen ion concentration say 100 x 10¯ 8 m and you are asked for the p h b you perform the calculation log 100 x 10¯ 8  c you announce the answer 8000 d to your horror you are told this is the wrong answer what in the world happened the answer is that the negative log technique is actually an approximation but youre not told that during the usual teaching of a chemistry class on a personal note the chem team does not remember learning this particular trick during his chemistry classes in high school and college of course those classes were in the ancient days of the late 1960s and early 1970s so nuff said the approximation is that the contribution of hydrogen ion from water is ignored after all pure water already contains hydrogen ion at a concentration of 100 x 10¯ 7 m when the hydrogen ion contribution from an acid is 1000 to 1000000 times more the contribution from water can safely be ignored not so when the h   100 x 10¯ 8 m in that case a more complex technique is used which takes the hydrogen ion from water into account when that is done the correct answer to the above example is 698 however that more complex technique will not be discussed here by the by i discuss the above example trick question in a video here it is problem 1 heres a variant thats not framed in a tricky way show that the p h of a solution remains 700 when 10 x 10¯ 11 moles of hcl is added to the solution solution1 p h of 700 means this h   10 x 10¯ 7 m2 add 10 x 10¯ 11 moles of h  to get10001 x 10¯ 7 mp h   log 10001 x 10¯ 7  699995663 round the answer off to two significant figuresp h  700by the way no p h meter constructed is sensitive enough to determine a value like 69999566 heck its a tricky business to get 3 or 4 sig figs on a p h meter much less 6 or 7 problem 2 another variation assume that you prepared a solution by adding 005 m l 1 drop of 0500 hcl to 500 x 10 7 m l of pure water calculate the resultant p h hint the answer is not p h  93 add up the hydronium ions from all sourcessolution the key is to remember that pure water is naturally 100 x 10¯ 7 m in hydrogen ion thats the thinking behind the all sources hint1 calculate total h  in 500 x 10 7 m l of water 100 x 10¯ 7 moll 500 x 10 4 l  0005 mol2 calculate total h  in hcl 0500 moll 000005 l  0000025 mol3 add the results together0005 mol  0000025 mol  0005025 mol4 calculate new molarity of hydrogen ion0005025 mol  500 x 10 4 l  1005 x 10¯ 7 m5 calculate new p h log 1005 x 10¯ 7  69978rounded off to three sig figs the p h is 6998 since we had 005 m l lets round off to one sig fig to arrive at a p h of 70 by the way a p h of 93 is arrived at like this h  from hcl  0000025 mol total volume  500 x 10 4 l h   0000025 mol  500 x 10 4 l  500 x 10¯ 10 mp h  log 500 x 10¯ 10  9301problem 3 another variation someday one can hopereturn to the acid base menu
