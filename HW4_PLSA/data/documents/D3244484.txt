subject 6 image from video monitor a teleprompter also known as a telescript or an autocue is a display device that prompts the person speaking with an electronic visual text of a speech or script using a teleprompter is similar to the practice of using cue cards the screen is in front of and usually below the camera lens of a professional video camera and the words on the screen are reflected to the eyes of the presenter using a sheet of clear glass or specially prepared beam splitter light from the performer passes through the front side of the glass into the lens while a shroud surrounding the lens and the back side of the glass prevents unwanted light from reflecting into the lens as the speaker does not need to look down to consult written notes he or she appears to have memorized the speech or be speaking spontaneously and will look directly into the camera lens cue cards on the other hand will always be placed away from the lens axis making the speaker look at a point beside the camera which leaves an impression of distraction contents1 history2 etymology3 modern design31 television32 interrotron4 notes5 external links history u s president lyndon johnson
