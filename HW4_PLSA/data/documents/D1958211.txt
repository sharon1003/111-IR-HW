video what causes foot blisters from runningby rebecca rushton injury  rehab information triathlon and endurance coaching  7 comments  affiliate disclosure foot blisters from running are one of the most common yet unreported injuries in sport at best running blisters take the fun out of training and reduce performance at worst they can cause serious illhealth if not dealt with appropriately let’s take a look at what causes foot blisters and how we can use that knowledge to make our running blister prevention strategies more effective in having a solution for how to prevent blisters athletes know just how important blister prevention is and consider it an essential part of their preparation unfortunately your success in learning how to prevent blisters continues to be rather hit and miss the purpose of this article is to help you understand what causes blisters and where your opportunities for running blister prevention may lie what causes foot blisters from running most people think friction is what causes foot blisters but friction is only part of the blister story blisters are caused by shear shear is the stretching of skin and soft tissues too much shear causes microtears to occur just under the skin surface these tears fill with fluid which results in a blister the following video does a great job of explaining what causes foot blisters your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  000shear is influenced by three things skin characteristics making some areas of the body and some people more prone to blisters than others the movement of the bones the more the bones move relative to the skin the bigger the chance of shear injury friction friction is not rubbing friction is the force that keeps two surfaces in stationary contact with one another foot blisters occur when high friction keeps the shoe sock and skin stuck to one another while the bones move back and forth causing stretching of the skin and soft tissues in between this is what causes blisters shear not rubbingonce the cause of blisters is understood it allows for a purposeful approach to how to prevent blisters the flowchart below identifies factors relevant to blister causation and the opportunities for prevention how to prevent running blisters pressure is a factor that enables friction to become blistercausing therefore cushioning and other methods of pressure reduction like sorbothane insoles moleskin and silicone gels can be helpful in preventing running blisters but many runners will acknowledge that cushioning alone is not the holy grail of blister prevention also the more cushioning you add to your shoe the tighter it becomes and pressure increases elsewhere so try cushioning and pressure deflection by all means but be aware it may not be enough how to prevent blisters tapng sports tape does not necessarily reduce shear very slippery tape like gaffa tape might but traditional brown sports tape is much less likely to provide a solution in how to prevent blisters yet sports tape remains a very popular running blister prevention method used by runners why the answer to the conundrum ‘how to prevent blisters’ is to reduce nasty effects of rubbing abrasions and chafing the previous video showed that you do not need rubbing to cause shear and therefore blisters but the two often occur at the same time when rubbing occurs over a blister it deroofs it and you’re left with a red raw sore tape provides protection to the skin so that the blister roof is more resistant to rubbing the blister will still form but at least the top won’t get rubbed off there is no doubt that’s a good thing a deroofed blister is not only painful but at risk of infection but sports tape often doesn’t prevent the blister a fact that many athletes know from bitter experience indiscriminate vs target friction reduction friction is necessary to walk and run without it the lack of traction would make the foot slide around too much in the shoe making it difficult to keep your balance and it would make propulsion all but ineffective yet many runners in their efforts to reduce friction take it too far with lubricants lubricants like vaseline applied all over the foot has this very effect black toenails and bruising are common consequences yet as the lubricant absorbs and disperses over time after one hour friction has been found to increase above baseline measures there are many runners using lubricants successfully in preventing blisters if you’re new to this strategy i would suggest a more targeted approach by applying to problem areas only and for exercise duration of under one hour the shoesock interface the most widely used preventative measures focus on the area between the skin and the sock skinsock interface the difficulties here centre mainly on the effect of perspiration it loosens adhesive products and dilutes preparations applied skin irritation is also an issue for some the shoesock interface is an area that may hold more potential for longerterm blister prevention engo patches are used in this way they are selfadhesive patches that stick to the inner shoe surface including insoles orthotics and inside shoes not the skin the friction level when using engo is reduced by up to 80 engo patches are used to target high friction at problem areas only whilst maintaining normal friction necessary for efficient gait they are thin enough to not affect shoe fit 038mm durable enough to last 500km and the lowfriction properties are maintained even in moist conditions how to prevent blisters take home messages blister prevention tends to be a hit and miss affair partly because blister causation is poorly understood but the flowchart identifies there are many opportunities for how to prevent blisters depending on factors relevant to the individual athlete some of the running blister prevention strategies are better than others personally i think altering your activity in an effort to avoid blisters is unacceptable but others are happy to take that route i’m a big fan of engo patches but as you can see it is only a tiny piece of the whole blister prevention story there are pros and cons to each strategy and what works for one might not work for another the challenge for runners who experience foot blisters is threefold to look past preconceived ideas of the causes of blisters to fully understand what causes foot blisters take a more structured approach to figuring out how to prevent blisters rather than the hit and miss approach of yesterday in order to find a running blister prevention strategy or combination of strategies that work for you about the author rebecca

2013 at 1015 pm thanks for the article could you please clarrify the difference between rubbing and shearing i would have thought rubbing was a form of friction which in itself falls within the parameters of shearing force thanks again reply rebecca rushton december 17 2013 at 1125 pm sure christianrubbing is what’s happening on the surface of the skin shearing is what’s happening internally shear is the parallel sliding of tissue layers over one another this might help explain step 1 place the tip of your right index finger on the back of your left hand step 2 wobble it back and forth but keep it stuck to the same bit of skin notice how your skin stretches this is shear and this is what causes blisters keep wobbling as you read shear might look like rubbing but it’s not notice how your finger tip has not moved relative to the skin of the back of your hand but your hand skin has moved relative to the underlying bone this is shear when shear is excessive and repetitive blisters form – it’s that last little bit of shear that is damaging when there is maximum parallel stretch within the skin in practical terms shear does occur when there is rubbing but interestingly rubbing lowers the shear peak read more about peak shear here httpwwwblisterpreventioncomaublisterblogfrictionblisterswhatisfriction  reply blisters caused by gait not shoes… and how i stopped them – trail
