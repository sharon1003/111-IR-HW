developing a knowledge management strategy best practice articleopen book from shutterstock written by james robertson published by step two  httpwwwsteptwocomaupaperskmckmstrategyfiled under articles knowledge management organisations are facing everincreasing challenges brought on by marketplace pressures or the nature of the workplace many organisations are now looking to knowledge management km to address these challenges such initiatives are often started with the development of a knowledge management strategy to be successful a km strategy must do more than just outline highlevel goals such as ‘become a knowledgeenabled organisation’ instead the strategy must identify the key needs and issues within the organisation and provide a framework for addressing these this article provides an approach for developing a km strategy that focuses strongly on an initial needs analysis taking this approach ensures that any activities and initiatives are firmly grounded in the real needs and challenges confronting the organisation the need for knowledge management there are a number of common situations that are widely recognised as benefiting from knowledge management approaches while they are not the only issues that can be tackled with km techniques it is useful to explore a number of these situations in order to provide a context for the development of a km strategy these scenarios includecall centresfrontline staffbusiness managersageing workforcesupporting innovation beyond these typical situations each organisation will have unique issues and problems to be overcome a km strategy must address the real needs and issues of the business click to tweet call centres call centres have increasingly become the main ‘public face’ for many organisations this role is made more challenging by the expectations of customers that they can get the answers they need within minutes of ringing up other challenges confront call centres includinghighpressure closelymonitored environmenthigh staff turnovercostly and lengthy training for new staff in this environment the need for knowledge management is clear and immediate failure to address these issues impacts upon sales public reputation or legal exposure for more on this see the article knowledge management for call centres frontline staff beyond the call centre many organisations have a wide range of frontline staff who interact with customers or members of the public they may operate in the field such as sales staff or maintenance crews or be located at branches or behind frontdesks in large organisations these frontline staff are often very dispersed geographically with limited communication channels to head office typically there are also few mechanisms for sharing information between staff working in the same business area but different locations the challenge in the frontline environment is to ensure consistency accuracy and repeatability for more on this see the article knowledge management for frontline staff frontline staff often have the greatest km needs with the biggest impact on customers click to tweet business managers the volume of information available to business management has increased greatly known as ‘information overload’ or ‘infoglut’ the challenge is now to filter out the key information needed to support business decisions the pace of organisational change is also increasing as are the demands on the ‘people skills’ of management staff in this environment there is a need for sound decision making these decisions are enabled by accurate complete and relevant information knowledge management can play a key role in supporting the information needs of management staff it can also assist with the mentoring and coaching skills needed by modern managers the loss of key staff can have a major km impact on the business click to tweet ageing workforce the public sector is particularly confronted by the impacts of an aging workforce increasingly private sector organisations are also recognising that this issue needs to be addressed if the continuity of business operations are to be maintained longserving staff have a depth of knowledge that is relied upon by other staff particularly in environments where little effort has been put into capturing or managing knowledge at an organisational level in this situation the loss of these key staff can have a major impact upon the level of knowledge within the organisation knowledge management can assist by putting in place a structured mechanism for capturing or transferring this knowledge when staff retire supporting innovation many organisations have now recognised the importance of innovation in ensuring longterm growth and even survival this is particularly true in fastmoving industry sectors such as it consulting telecommunications and pharmaceuticals most organisations however are constructed to ensure consistency repeatability and efficiency of current processes and products innovation is does not tend to sit comfortably with this type of focus and organisations often need to look to unfamiliar techniques to encourage and drive innovation there has been considerable work in the knowledge management field regarding the process of innovation and how to nurture it in a business environment organisational environment every organisation has a unique environment defined by factors such aspurpose and activities of the organisationoverall strategic directionorganisational culturesize of the organisationgeographic spreadstaff skills and experienceorganisational historyavailable resourcesmarketplace factors for this reason each organisation has a unique set of needs and issues to be addressed by knowledge management it is easy to jump into ‘solutions mode’ recommending approaches such as communities of practice storytelling content management systems and much more while these approaches may have widespread success in other organisations they will only succeed in the current environment if they meet actual staff needs in practice organisations are littered with wellmeaning but poorly targeted knowledge management activities in many cases these failed because they simply didn’t address a clear concrete and imperative problem within the organisation this is now recognised as one of the ‘critical success factors’ for knowledge management identify the needs within the organisation and then design the activities accordingly understand real km needs and avoid jumping directly into solutions mode click to tweet developing a km strategy there are many approaches for developing a knowledge management strategy each supported by a holistic model of km processes developing a knowledge management strategy these can be classified into two main approaches topdown the overall strategic direction of the organisation is used to identify the focus of the knowledge management initiative this is reflected in a series of activities designed to meet this broad goal bottomup research is conducted into the activities of staff involved in key business processes the findings of this research highlights key staff needs and issues which are then tackled through a range of knowledge management initiatives each of these approaches has its strengths and in practice a success km programme must encompass both this article presents a model that focuses strongly on the needs analysis activities with staff to drive a primarily bottomup strategy as follows identify the key staff groups within the organisation these groups deliver the greatest business value or are involved in the most important business activities conduct comprehensive and holistic needs analysis activities with selected staff groups to identify key needs and issues supplement this research with input from senior management and organisational strategy documents to determine an overall strategic focus based on these findings develop recommendations for addressing the issues and needs identified implement a series of strategic and tactical initiatives based on the recommendations these will select suitable knowledge management techniques and approaches benefits of this approach historically many knowledge management strategies have focused solely on the topdown approach identifying highlevel objectives such as ‘become a knowledgeenabled organisation’ with little understanding of the key issues and needs of staff throughout the organisation these initiatives found it difficult to engage staff in the required cultural and process changes as a result many of these initiatives had little longterm impact on the organisation despite initial efforts recognising these issues this approach focuses much more strongly on the initial needs analysis activities the approach to developing a km strategy outlined in this article provides a number of major benefits holistic the focus on needs analysis will identify a wide range of issues and requirements some will be organisationwide while others will be specific to individual business units or job roles the use of a range of needs analysis techniques will identifycultural issueskey business needsduplication of effortinconsistencies in practicesinefficiencies in business processesopportunities for improved policies or proceduresmajor business risksand much more solutionindependent the approach used to develop the knowledge management strategy makes no assumptions about the solutions that might be implemented as such the approach is independent of any technologies implemented or knowledge management techniques applied instead the approach is to identify the need and then determine the solution simple the use of welltested needs analysis techniques gives confidence that the true issues in the organisation will be identified in practice these simply ‘fall out’ of the research activities with the key strategic and tactical recommendations becoming obvious in most cases this simplicity makes the process easy to implement and ensures that the findings and recommendations are wellunderstood throughout the organisation efficient a modest amount of initial research will be sufficient to identify the most crucial problems within the organisation these can then be tackled with suitable activities and initiatives once this first round of projects have delivered tangible business benefits additional targeted research can be used to identify further issues to be addressed this ‘iterative’ approach can then be repeated ensuring that business improvements are seen even as the next round of research is initiated targets resources there are many ‘good ideas’ that can be drawn from the field of knowledge management the challenge is to identify those approaches that will have the greatest impact upon the organisation by starting with the needs analysis approaches can be targeted to address the most critical issues or to deliver the greatest business benefits target critical issues with your km strategy making the most of available resources click to tweet identifying key staff groups the first step in the process is to identify the key staff groups in the organisation the key staff are typically those directly involved in the most important business activities in general the key staff groups are more likely to be those at the frontline rather than managers or administrative staff this will of course depend on the nature and structure of the organisation common staff groups involvefrontline staffcall centre stafffield workersresearchersclinical staffproduction workersadministrative and support staffmanagers senior lineit staff each of these groups will have specific needs and issues as well as those in common with the organisation as a whole by targeting the key staff groups the extent to which the needs vary across the organisation can be identified and the km strategy developed accordingly the starting point for all km strategies is to conduct robust needs analysis click to tweet needs analysis techniques there are a wide range of need analysis techniques drawn from fields such as knowledge management usercentred design ethnography and anthropology techniques includefacilitated discussionsfocus groupssurveysstaff interviewsworkplace observationcontextual inquirytask analysis in practice more than one technique should be used with a selected group of staff to ensure that a complete picture is built up each of the techniques are briefly described in the sections below facilitated discussions there are a wide range of facilitated discussion techniques that can be used to explore issues with targeted staff groups these are most commonly used with management consultants and other staff comfortable with these types of meetings techniques such as ‘affinity diagrams’ can be used to provide structure to the discussions and to capture the issues identified in many cases facilitated discussions are used as the primary mechanism for gaining the strategic input required for the development of the km strategy focus groups these are a specific and widelyused form of facilitated discussions that focus on exploring a topic within a group setting often used as a way of gathering input from larger numbers of stakeholders focus groups must be run carefully if they are to generate meaningful results focus group are best used to explore current issues and problems rather than to discuss future ‘wishlists’ of knowledge management approaches focus groups should always be used in conjunction with techniques such as staff interviews and contextual inquiry to ensure that the results are meaningful surveys the use of surveys is widespread and they are a very efficient way of gaining input from a large number of staff throughout an organisation in practice surveys are best used to gather staff opinions rather than specific information on which to base decisions care must also be taken when developing the survey questions and analysing the results survey results must always be supported with the use of other techniques to provide confidence in the findings staff interviews oneonone interviews are one of the most effective and often used techniques for identifying staff needs and issues for more on applying these as part of a knowledge management project see the following two articles stakeholder interviews as simple knowledge mapping selecting staff for stakeholder interviews workplace observation this involves going ‘out into the field’ to observe the activities of staff and the environment in which they work workplace observation is particularly effective in environments such as call centres manufacturing areas field working or ontheroad staff it is a very holistic technique that will identify patterns of work and environment issues that are impossible to gather using techniques such as surveys or focus groups contextual inquiry this is a combination of staff interviews and workplace observation that involves exploring issues with a staff person while situated within their normal working environment by conducting the interview ‘in context’ it becomes possible to see the resources used by staff when conducting work activities the interviewer can also ask the staff person to show them how they complete specific activities for example showing how they find a piece of information on the intranet this technique is very effective at identifying issues with currentlyavailable information sources and tools task analysis not all activities within an organisation are of equal value key business tasks should be identified and investigated to gain an understanding of the steps involved and the knowledge required at each step the existing sources of the knowledge can then be identified along with the key issues and roadblocks impacting upon the effectiveness and efficiency of the task this type of research will identify mechanisms for both improving the task itself as well as indicating how to improve the provision of knowledge to those involved in completing the task strategic input while the needs analysis activities focused on the ‘bottomup’ aspects of the km project the overall strategic focus must also be identified this strategic focus then guides the knowledge management strategy providing a framework for the selection and prioritisation of individual projects and activities in this way both the bottomup and topdown aspects of the knowledge management strategy are addressed there are a number of sources of input that can be drawn upon when determining the strategic focus including senior management involvement via interviews facilitated discussions or other interactions organisational strategy documents such as the corporate plan or annual report results of other strategic research projects such as ‘staff satisfaction surveys’ external market research industry ‘best practices’ and other reports drawn from relevant industry or sector bodies these inputs can then be synthesised into a strategic focus for the knowledge management initiatives a km strategy finds the intersections between staff needs and business strategies click to tweet common findings the needs analysis and strategic input will highlight a broad range of issues and needs throughout the organisation in past projects we have identified issues such asdifficulty in finding key corporate informationinconsistent and unstructured approach to information managementineffective dissemination of corporate and regional newsreliance on ‘rumour’ and ‘gossip’ as the key sources of organisational newslack of knowledge sharing between related business unitsdifficulties in determining and disseminating ‘best practices’inconsistency in advice given by call centre and frontline staffover reliance on longservice members of staff as sources of knowledgecultural barriers between head office and regional staffduplication of effort between regionsroadblocks between policy development and programme implementation these are just a small sampling of possible findings to provide an idea of the types of issues that will often drive the implementation of a knowledge management strategy acting on the findings with an indepth understanding of the problems issues and needs within the organisation it is then possible to meaningfully determine appropriate strategies for addressing them this will undoubtedly include a range of both strategic longterm and tactical shortterm initiatives depending on the issues identified these might includeimproving the corporate intranetformalising communities of practiceimplementing coaching and mentoring programmesimproving document and records managementfacilitating skills transfer from retiring staffcapturing staff knowledge in a documented formimproving policies and proceduresimplementing new learning approaches including elearningenhancing the corporate staff directoryimplementing team collaboration tools and processesestablishing afteraction review processesformalising the role of ‘knowledge brokers’ within the organisation these are just a small crosssection of the many possible approaches that can be taken to knowledge management as highlighted throughout this article only the needs analysis activities allow a meaningful selection to be made between these different approaches in practice each organisation will apply a unique mix of shortterm ‘quick wins’ and longerterm projects to meet knowledge management needs conclusion developing a knowledge management strategy provides a unique opportunity to gain a greater understanding of the way the organisation operates and the challenges that confront it by focusing on identifying staff needs and issues activities and initiatives can be recommended with the confidence that these will have a clear and measurable impact upon the organisation supplementing this ‘bottomup’ research with a strategic focus then ensures that the km initiative is aligned with broader organisational directions taking this approach to the development of a km strategy allows limited resources to be targeted to the key needs within the organisation delivering the greatest business benefits while positioning the organisation for longterm growth and stability comments off
