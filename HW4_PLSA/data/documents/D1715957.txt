chipmunks are wonderful we have some too best food for them is what you buy at any good market that is made for squirrels or pet hamsters or guinea pigs or rats and mice do not feed them salted peanuts they also love small pieces of fruit like berries or grapes and this is good for them too sunflower seeds are great too the rabbits can be fed regular rabbit food which can be purchased from any good feed store or pet shop note keep any domestic cats away from the chipmunks they will kill them source s professional wildlife cinematographer photographer  naturalist  35 years bwana · 10

actually the place hotelbye  brussels is an amazingly small easygoing and humansized city for several their importance unlike anthers city with their hordes of tourists brussels is belgiums principal financial and academic centre which provides the city an even more workaday feel than different towns here in brussels if youd choose to see you will get a proper experience for belgian living especially their excellent cafe and café culture while brussels might not have the celebrity attractions of different belgian areas the capital has plenty of to keep guests occupied for a couple of days with a clutch of worldclass museums and art galleries along with quirkier sights including the atomium and some wonderful remnants of old structure in the old community quarter · 1 year ago1 0

open fur ears up they will be eating solid food and likely know enough from the mother to stay safe know what the dangers are they were likely born in an underground warren and will return to that safe place with or without their mother if they are young enough to still require milk it becomes much more complicated to help them and many wild rabbits will die of fright in captivity they believe that humans are predators and our intent is to kill and eat them if they are this young a rehabber is really the only hope rehabbers have special formulas to calculate the nutritional requirements based on age weight stomach capacity they have knowledge about natural history and all the medicines foodstuff and vitamins required to successfully raise and release these babies if you call them they may have a volunteer that will pick up the babies if they are young enough and require full care they will often allow you to participate in the future release maybe right in your neighbourhood where they were born please call them they could be very helpful it would be illegal to interfer with the native wildlife although providing a bit of extra food ensure they have fresh water and safety is not really interfering providing you are not attempting to interact with them in any other way they should have only natural foods veggies fruits things without salt sugar preservatives im in agreement about the water barrel if not a hole in it at the very minimum it requires a lid or screen to protect the wildlife from falling in and your neighbour should be reported for the killing of a mother and therefore her young as well if you can not convince them to cover it put in a block of wood like a piece of 2x4 it will float and the chipmunks will be able to get out of the water onto the block of wood from there they should be able to get out of the barrel as well i am constantly frustrated by peoples uncaring attitudes towards the wild creatures that share our earth good luck with the bunnies thank you for caringclaudine · 2 years ago0 0 comment if you want to eat truly healthy lose body fat consistently normalize your blood pressure cholesterol levels prevent cancer and even boost your brain health and energy levels you may have heard all over the news that the paleo diet has been found to be one of the best methods of achieving all of these benefits compared to any other popular fad diets out there go here httpstinyurlima hm5o the truth is that the paleo diet will never be considered a fad because its just simply the way that humans evolved to eat over approximately 2 million years and eating in a similar fashion to our ancestors has been proven time and time again to offer amazing health benefits including prevention of most diseases of civilization such as cancer heart disease alzheimers and other chronic conditions that are mostly caused by poor diet and lifestyle one of the biggest misunderstandings about the paleo diet is that its a meateating diet or a super lowcarb diet this is not true victoria · 2 years ago0 2 comment what do chipmunks eat source shttpsshorteimba9b0herzog · 1 year ago0 0 comment i dont know what to feed wild chipmunks i took one
