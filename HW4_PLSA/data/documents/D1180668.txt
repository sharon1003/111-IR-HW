distinct by society first used to refer to speakers of a common language and then to denote national affiliations by the 17th century the term race began to refer to physical  phenotypical traits modern scholarship regards race as a social construct that is a symbolic identity created to establish some cultural meaning while partially based on physical similarities within groups race is not an inherent physical or biological quality 1 2social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time involving folk taxonomies 3 that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete 4 and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits 5 6 7 8 9even though there is a broad scientific agreement that essentialist and typological conceptualizations of race are untenable scientists around the world continue to conceptualize race in widely differing ways some of which have essentialist implications 10 while some researchers use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits or observable differences in behaviour others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive 5 or simplistic way 11 and argue that among humans race has no taxonomic significance by pointing out that all living humans belong to the same species homo sapiens and as far as applicable subspecies homo sapiens sapiens 12 13since the second half of the 20th century the association of race with the ideologies and theories of scientific racism has led to the use of the word race itself becoming problematic  according to whom although still used in general contexts race has often been replaced by less ambiguous and loaded

views racial categories as socially constructed that is race is not intrinsic to human beings but rather an identity created often by socially dominant groups to establish meaning in a social context this often involves the subjugation of groups defined as racially inferior as in the onedrop rule used in the 19thcentury united states to exclude those with any amount of african ancestry from the dominant racial grouping defined as  white  1 such racial identities reflect the cultural attitudes of imperial powers dominant during the age of european colonial expansion 2 this view rejects the notion that race is biologically defined 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  excessive citationsalthough commonalities in physical traits such as facial features skin color and hair texture comprise part of the race concept the latter is a social distinction rather than an inherently biological one 1 other dimensions of racial groupings include shared history traditions and language for instance africanamerican english is a language spoken by many african americans especially in areas of the united states where racial segregation exists furthermore people often selfidentify as members of a race for political reasons 1when people define and talk about a particular conception of race they create a social reality through which social categorization is achieved 23 in this sense races are said to be social constructs 24 these constructs develop within various legal economic and sociopolitical contexts and may be the effect rather than the cause of major social situations 25 while race is understood to be a social construct by many most scholars agree that race has real material effects in the lives of people through institutionalized practices of preference and discrimination socioeconomic factors in combination with early but enduring views of race have led to considerable suffering within disadvantaged racial groups 26 racial discrimination often coincides with racist mindsets whereby the individuals and ideologies of one group come to perceive the members of an outgroup as both racially defined and morally inferior 27 as a result racial groups possessing relatively little power often find themselves excluded or oppressed while hegemonic individuals and institutions are charged with holding racist attitudes 28 racism has led to many instances of tragedy including slavery and genocide 29in some countries law enforcement uses race to profile suspects this use of racial categories is frequently criticized for perpetuating an outmoded understanding of human biological variation and promoting stereotypes because in some societies racial groupings correspond closely with patterns of social stratification for social scientists studying social inequality race can be a significant variable as sociological factors racial categories may in part reflect subjective attributions selfidentities and social institutions 30 31scholars continue to debate the degrees to which racial categories are biologically warranted and socially constructed 32 for example in 2008 john hartigan jr argued for a view of race that focused primarily on culture but which does not ignore the potential relevance of biology or genetics 33 accordingly the racial paradigms employed in different disciplines vary in their emphasis on biological reduction as contrasted with societal construction in the social sciences theoretical frameworks such as racial formation theory and critical race theory investigate implications of race as social construction by exploring how the images ideas and assumptions of race are expressed in everyday life a large body of scholarship has traced the relationships between the historical social production of race in legal and criminal language and their effects on the policing and disproportionate incarceration of certain groups historical origins of racial classification see also historical race concepts the three great races according to meyers konversationslexikon of 188590 the subtypes of the mongoloid race are shown in yellow and orange tones those of the caucasoid race in light and medium grayish spring green  cyan tones and those of the negroid race in brown tones dravidians and sinhalese are in olive green and their classification is described as uncertain the mongoloid race sees the widest geographic distribution including all of the americas north asia east asia and southeast asia the entire inhabited arctic while they form most of central asia and the pacific islands the racial diversity of asia s peoples nordisk familjebok 1904groups of humans have always identified themselves as distinct from neighboring groups but such differences have not always been understood to be natural immutable and global these features are the distinguishing features of how the concept of race is used today in this way the idea of race as we understand it today came about during the historical process of exploration and conquest which brought europeans into contact with groups from different continents and of the ideology of classification and typology found in the natural sciences 34 the term race was often used in a general biological taxonomic sense 14 starting from the 19th century to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype 35 36colonialism according to smedley and marks the european concept of race along with many of the ideas now associated with the term arose at the time of the scientific revolution which introduced and privileged the study of natural kinds and the age of european imperialism and colonization which established political relations between europeans and peoples with distinct cultural and political traditions 34 37 as europeans encountered people from different parts of the world they speculated about the physical social and cultural differences among various human groups the rise of the atlantic slave trade which gradually displaced an earlier trade in slaves from throughout the world created a further incentive to categorize human groups in order to justify the subordination of african slaves 38 drawing on sources from classical antiquity and upon their own internal interactions – for example the hostility between the english and irish powerfully influenced early european thinking about the differences between people 39 – europeans began to sort themselves and others into groups based on physical appearance and to attribute to individuals belonging to these groups behaviors and capacities which were claimed to be deeply ingrained a set of folk beliefs took hold that linked inherited physical differences between groups to inherited intellectual behavioral and moral qualities 40 similar ideas can be found in other cultures 41 for example in china where a concept often translated as race was associated with supposed common descent from the yellow emperor and used to stress the unity of ethnic groups in china brutal conflicts between ethnic groups have existed throughout history and across the world 42early taxonomic models the first post graecoroman published classification of humans into distinct races seems to be françois bernier s nouvelle division de la terre par les différents espèces ou races qui lhabitent new division of earth by the different species or races which inhabit it published in 1684 43 in the 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation but the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups always attributing the most desirable features to the white european race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes the 1735 classification of carl linnaeus inventor of zoological taxonomy divided the human species homo sapiens into continental varieties of europaeus asiaticus americanus and afer each associated with a different humour sanguine melancholic choleric and phlegmatic respectively 44 45 homo sapiens europaeus was described as active acute and adventurous whereas homo sapiens afer was said to be crafty lazy and careless 46the 1775 treatise the natural varieties of mankind by johann friedrich blumenbach proposed five major divisions the caucasoid race the mongoloid race the ethiopian race later termed negroid  the american indian race and the malayan race but he did not propose any hierarchy among the races 46 blumenbach also noted the graded transition in appearances from one group to adjacent groups and suggested that one variety of mankind does so sensibly pass into the other that you cannot mark out the limits between them 47from the 17th through 19th centuries the merging of folk beliefs about group differences with scientific explanations of those differences produced what smedley has called an  ideology of race 37 according to this ideology races are primordial natural enduring and distinct it was further argued that some groups may be the result of mixture between formerly distinct populations but that careful study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce admixed groups 42 subsequent influential classifications by georges buffon petrus camper and christoph meiners all classified negros as inferior to europeans 46 in the united states the racial theories of thomas jefferson were influential he saw africans as inferior to whites especially in regards to their intellect and imbued with unnatural sexual appetites but described native americans as equals to whites 48polygenism vs monogenism in the last two decades of the 18th century the theory of polygenism the belief that different races had evolved separately in each continent and shared no common ancestor 49 was advocated in england by historian edward long and anatomist charles white in germany by ethnographers christoph meiners and georg forster and in france by julienjoseph virey in the us samuel george morton josiah nott and louis agassiz promoted this theory in the midnineteenth century polygenism was popular and most widespread in the 19th century culminating in the founding of the anthropological society of london 1863 which during the period of the american civil war broke away from the ethnological society of london and its monogenic stance their underlined difference lying relevantly in the socalled negro question a substantial racist view by the former 50 and a more liberal view on race by the latter 51modern scholarship models of human evolution see also multiregional hypothesis and recent single origin hypothesis today all humans are classified as belonging to the species homo sapiens however this is not the first species of homininae the first species of genus homo homo habilis evolved in east africa at least 2 million years ago and members of this species populated different parts of africa in a relatively short time homo erectus evolved more than 18 million years ago and by 15 million years ago had spread throughout europe and asia virtually all physical anthropologists agree that archaic homo sapiens a group including the possible species h heidelbergensis h rhodesiensis and h neanderthalensis evolved out of african homo erectus  sensu lato or homo ergaster 52 53 anthropologists support the idea that anatomically modern humans  homo sapiens evolved in north or east africa from an archaic human species such as h heidelbergensis and then migrated out of africa mixing with and replacing h heidelbergensis and h neanderthalensis populations throughout europe and asia and h rhodesiensis populations in subsaharan africa a combination of the out of africa and multiregional models 54  verification neededbiological classification further information race biology species subspecies systematics phylogenetics and cladistics in the early 20th century many anthropologists taught that race was an entirely biologically phenomenon and that this was core to a persons behavior and identity a position commonly called racial essentialism 55 this coupled with a belief that linguistic cultural and social groups fundamentally existed along racial lines formed the basis of what is now called scientific racism 56 after the nazi eugenics program along with the rise of anticolonial movements racial essentialism lost widespread popularity 57 new studies of culture and the fledgling field of population genetics undermined the scientific standing of racial essentialism leading race anthropologists to revise their conclusions about the sources of phenotypic variation 55 a significant number of modern anthropologists and biologists in the west came to view race as an invalid genetic or biological designation 58the first to challenge the concept of race on empirical grounds were the anthropologists franz boas who provided evidence of phenotypic plasticity due to environmental factors 59 and ashley montagu who relied on evidence from genetics 60 e o wilson then challenged the concept from the perspective of general animal systematics and further rejected the claim that races were equivalent to subspecies 61human genetic variation is predominantly within races continuous and complex in structure which is inconsistent with the concept of genetic human races 62 according to jonathan marks 34by the 1970s it had become clear that 1 most human differences were cultural 2 what was not cultural was principally polymorphic – that is to say found in diverse groups of people at different frequencies 3 what was not cultural or polymorphic was principally clinal – that is to say gradually variable over geography and 4 what was left – the component of human diversity that was not cultural polymorphic or clinal was very small a consensus consequently developed among anthropologists and geneticists that race as the previous generation had known it – as largely discrete geographically distinct gene pools – did not exist subspecies the term race in biology is used with caution because it can be ambiguous generally when it is used it is effectively a synonym of subspecies 63 for animals the only taxonomic unit below the species level is usually the subspecies 64 there are narrower infraspecific ranks in botany and race does not correspond directly with any of them traditionally subspecies are seen as geographically isolated and genetically differentiated populations 65 studies of human genetic variation show that human populations are not geographically isolated 66 and their genetic differences are far smaller than those among comparable subspecies 67in 1978 sewall wright suggested that human populations that have long inhabited separated parts of the world should in general be considered different subspecies by the criterion that most individuals of such populations can be allocated correctly by inspection wright argued that it does not require a trained anthropologist to classify an array of englishmen west africans and chinese with 100 accuracy by features skin color and type of hair despite so much variability within each of these groups that every individual can easily be distinguished from every other 68 while in practice subspecies are often defined by easily observable physical appearance there is not necessarily any evolutionary significance to these observed differences so this form of classification has become less acceptable to evolutionary biologists 69 likewise this typological approach to race is generally regarded as discredited by biologists and anthropologists ancestrally differentiated populations cladessome researchers  who have tried to clarify the idea of race by equating it to the biological idea of the clade a clade is a taxonomic group of organisms consisting of a single common ancestor and all the descendants of that ancestor a monophyletic group every creature produced by sexual reproduction has two immediate lineages one maternal and one paternal 70 whereas carl linnaeus established a taxonomy of living organisms based on anatomical similarities and differences cladistics seeks to establish a taxonomy – the phylogenetic tree – based on genetic similarities and differences and tracing the process of acquisition of multiple characteristics by single organisms philosopher robin andreasen 2000 proposes that cladistics can be used to categorize human races biologically and that races can be both biologically real and socially constructed 71 andreasen cites tree diagrams of relative genetic distances among populations published by luigi cavallisforza as the basis for a phylogenetic tree of human races cavallisforzas research illustrates that it is possible to reconstruct human evolutionary history and this means that it is possible to provide a cladistic definition of race p s661 evolutionary biologist alan templeton 2013 argues that while much of the recent scientific literature on human evolution portrays human populations as separate branches on an evolutionary tree multiple lines of evidence falsify a phylogenetic tree structure and confirm the presence of gene flow among populations 22 jonathan marks 2008 argues that andreasen has misinterpreted the genetic literature these trees are phenetic based on similarity rather than cladistic based on based on monophyletic descent that is from a series of unique ancestors 72 marks templeton and cavallisforza all conclude that genetics does not provide evidence of human races 22 73anthropologists lieberman and jackson 1995 also critique the use of cladistics to support concepts of race they claim that the molecular and biochemical proponents of this model explicitly use racial categories in their initial grouping of samples  for example the large and highly diverse macroethnic groups of east indians north africans and europeans are presumptively grouped as caucasians prior to the analysis of their dna variation this is claimed to limit and skew interpretations obscure other lineage relationships deemphasize the impact of more immediate clinal environmental factors on genomic diversity and can cloud our understanding of the true patterns of affinity they suggest that the authors of these studies find support for racial distinctions only because they began by assuming the validity of race for empirical reasons we prefer to place emphasis on clinal variation which recognizes the existence of adaptive human hereditary variation and simultaneously stresses that such variation is not found in packages that can be labeled races  74human population groups are not monophyletic as there appears to always have been considerable gene flow between human populations 65 keith hunley graciela cabana and jeffrey long analyzed the human genome diversity project sample of 1037 individuals in 52 populations 75 they found that nonafrican populations are a taxonomic subgroup of african populations that some african populations are equally related to other african populations and to nonafrican populations and that outside of africa regional groupings of populations are nested inside one another and many of them are not monophyletic  75 rachel caspari 2003 has argued that since no groups currently regarded as races are monophyletic none of those groups can be clades morphologically differentiated populations population geneticists have debated whether the concept of population can provide a basis for a new conception of race to do this a working definition of population must be found surprisingly there is no generally accepted concept of population that biologists use although the concept of population is central to ecology evolutionary biology and conservation biology most definitions of population rely on qualitative descriptions such as a group of organisms of the same species occupying a particular space at a particular time 76 waples and gaggiotti identify two broad types of definitions for populations those that fall into an ecological paradigm and those that fall into an evolutionary paradigm examples of such definitions are ecological paradigm a group of individuals of the same species that cooccur in space and time and have an opportunity to interact with each other evolutionary paradigm a group of individuals of the same species living in closeenough proximity that any member of the group can potentially mate with any other member 76sesardic argues that when several traits are analyzed at the same time forensic anthropologists can classify a persons race with an accuracy of close to 100 based on only skeletal remains 77 sesardics claim has been disputed by massimo pigliucci who accused sesardic of cherry pick ing the scientific evidence and reach ing conclusions that are contradicted by it specifically pigliucci argues that sesardic misrepresented a paper by ousley et al 2009 and neglected to mention that they identified differentiation not just between individuals from different races but also between individuals from different tribes local environments and time periods 78 this is discussed in a later section clines one crucial innovation in reconceptualizing genotypic and phenotypic variation was the anthropologist c loring brace s observation that such variations insofar as it is affected by natural selection slow migration or genetic drift are distributed along geographic gradations or clines 79 for example with respect to skin color in europe and africa brace writes to this day skin color grades by imperceptible means from europe southward around the eastern end of the mediterranean and up the nile into africa from one end of this range to the other there is no hint of a skin color boundary and yet the spectrum runs from the lightest in the world at the northern edge to as dark as it is possible for humans to be at the equator 80in part this is due to isolation by distance this point called attention to a problem common to phenotypebased descriptions of races for example those based on hair texture and skin color they ignore a host of other similarities and differences for example blood type that do not correlate highly with the markers for race thus anthropologist frank livingstones conclusion that since clines cross racial boundaries there are no races only clines 81in a response to livingstone theodore dobzhansky argued that when talking about race one must be attentive to how the term is being used i agree with dr livingstone that if races have to be discrete units then there are no races and if race is used as an explanation of the human variability rather than vice versa then the explanation is invalid he further argued that one could use the term race if one distinguished between race differences and the race concept the former refers to any distinction in gene frequencies between populations the latter is a matter of judgment he further observed that even when there is clinal variation race differences are objectively ascertainable biological phenomena  but it does not follow that racially distinct populations must be given racial or subspecific labels 81 in short livingstone and dobzhansky agree that there are genetic differences among human beings they also agree that the use of the race concept to classify people and how the race concept is used is a matter of social convention they differ on whether the race concept remains a meaningful and useful social convention skin color above and blood type b below are noncorcordant traits since their geographical distribution is not similar in 1964 the biologists paul ehrlich and holm pointed out cases where two or more clines are distributed discordantly – for example melanin is distributed in a decreasing pattern from the equator north and south frequencies for the haplotype for betas hemoglobin on the other hand radiate out of specific geographical points in africa 82 as the anthropologists leonard lieberman and fatimah linda jackson observed discordant patterns of heterogeneity falsify any description of a population as if it were genotypically or even phenotypically homogeneous 74patterns such as those seen in human physical and genetic variation as described above have led to the consequence that the number and geographic location of any described races is highly dependent on the importance attributed to and quantity of the traits considered scientists discovered a skinlighting mutation that partially accounts for the appearance of light skin in humans people who migrated out of africa northward into what is now europe which they estimate occurred 20000 to 50000 years ago the east asians owe their relatively light skin to different mutations 83 on the other hand the greater the number of traits or alleles considered the more subdivisions of humanity are detected since traits and gene frequencies do not always correspond to the same geographical location or as ossorio  duster 2005 put it anthropologists long ago discovered that humans physical traits vary gradually with groups that are close geographic neighbors being more similar than groups that are geographically separated this pattern of variation known as clinal variation is also observed for many alleles that vary from one human group to another another observation is that traits or alleles that vary from one group to another do not vary at the same rate this pattern is referred to as nonconcordant variation because the variation of physical traits is clinal and nonconcordant anthropologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries discovered that the more traits and the more human groups they measured the fewer discrete differences they observed among races and the more categories they had to create to classify human beings the number of races observed expanded to the 1930s and 1950s and eventually anthropologists concluded that there were no discrete races 84 twentieth and 21st century biomedical researchers have discovered this same feature when evaluating human variation at the level of alleles and allele frequencies nature has not created four or five distinct nonoverlapping genetic groups of people genetically differentiated populations main articles race and genetics and human genetic variation another way to look at differences between populations is to measure genetic differences rather than physical differences between groups the mid20thcentury anthropologist william c boyd defined race as a population which differs significantly from other populations in regard to the frequency of one or more of the genes it possesses it is an arbitrary matter which and how many gene loci we choose to consider as a significant constellation 85 leonard lieberman and rodney kirk have pointed out that the paramount weakness of this statement is that if one gene can distinguish races then the number of races is as numerous as the number of human couples reproducing 86 moreover the anthropologist stephen molnar has suggested that the discordance of clines inevitably results in a multiplication of races that renders the concept itself useless 87 the human genome project states people who have lived in the same geographic region for many generations may have some alleles in common but no allele will be found in all members of one population and in no members of any other 88 massimo pigliucci and jonathan kaplan argue that human races do exist and that they correspond to the genetic classification of ecotypes but that real human races do not correspond very much if at all to folk racial categories 89 in contrast walsh  yun reviewed the literature in 2011 and reported that genetic studies using very few chromosomal loci find that genetic polymorphisms divide human populations into clusters with almost 100 percent accuracy and that they correspond to the traditional anthropological categories 90some biologists argue that racial categories correlate with biological traits eg phenotype  and that certain genetic markers have varying frequencies among human populations some of which correspond more or less to traditional racial groupings for this reason there is no current consensus about whether racial categories can be considered to have significance for understanding human genetic variation 91distribution of genetic variation the distribution of genetic variants within and among human populations are impossible to describe succinctly because of the difficulty of defining a population the clinal nature of variation and heterogeneity across the genome long and kittles 2003 in general however an average of 85 of statistical genetic variation exists within local populations 7 is between local populations within the same continent and 8 of variation occurs between large groups living on different continents 92 the recent african origin theory for humans would predict that in africa there exists a great deal more diversity than elsewhere and that diversity should decrease the further from africa a population is sampled hence the 85 average figure is misleading long and kittles find that rather than 85 of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations about 100 of human diversity exists in a single african population whereas only about 60 of human genetic diversity exists in the least diverse population they analyzed the surui a population derived from new guinea 93 statistical analysis that takes this difference into account confirms previous findings that westernbased racial classifications have no taxonomic significance 94cluster analysis main article human genetic clustering a 2002 study of random biallelic genetic loci found little to no evidence that humans were divided into distinct biological groups 95in his 2003 paper  human genetic diversity lewontins fallacy  a w f edwards argued that rather than using a locusbylocus analysis of variation to derive taxonomy it is possible to construct a human classification system based on characteristic genetic patterns or clusters inferred from multilocus genetic data 96 97 geographically based human studies since have shown that such genetic clusters can be derived from analyzing of a large number of loci which can assort individuals sampled into groups analogous to traditional continental racial groups 98 joanna mountain and neil risch cautioned that while genetic clusters may one day be shown to correspond to phenotypic variations between groups such assumptions were premature as the relationship between genes and complex traits remains poorly understood 99 however risch denied such limitations render the analysis useless perhaps just using someones actual birth year is not a very good way of measuring age does that mean we should throw it out  any category you come up with is going to be imperfect but that doesnt preclude you from using it or the fact that it has utility 100early human genetic cluster analysis studies were conducted with samples taken from ancestral population groups living at extreme geographic distances from each other it was thought that such large geographic distances would maximize the genetic variation between the groups sampled in the analysis and thus maximize the probability of finding cluster patterns unique to each group in light of the historically recent acceleration of human migration and correspondingly human gene flow on a global scale further studies were conducted to judge the degree to which genetic cluster analysis can pattern ancestrally identified groups as well as geographically separated groups one such study looked at a large multiethnic population in the united states and detected only modest genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within each raceethnicity group thus ancient geographic ancestry which is highly correlated with selfidentified raceethnicity – as opposed to current residence – is the major determinant of genetic structure in the u s population  tang et al 2005witherspoon et al 2007 have argued that even when individuals can be reliably assigned to specific population groups it may still be possible for two randomly chosen individuals from different populationsclusters to be more similar to each other than to a randomly chosen member of their own cluster they found that many thousands of genetic markers had to be used in order for the answer to the question how often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations to be never this assumed three population groups separated by large geographic ranges european african and east asian the entire world population is much more complex and studying an increasing number of groups would require an increasing number of markers for the same answer the authors conclude that caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes 101 witherspoon et al concluded that the fact that given enough genetic data individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations not between them it is also compatible with our ﬁnding that even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used individuals are frequently more similar to members of other populations than to members of their own population 101anthropologists such as c loring brace 102 the philosophers jonathan kaplan and rasmus winther 103 104 105 106 and the geneticist joseph graves 11 have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as continental races this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations the cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled when one samples continental groups the clusters become continental if one had chosen other sampling patterns the clustering would be different weiss and fullerton have noted that if one sampled only icelanders mayans and maoris three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of maori icelandic and mayan genetic materials 107 kaplan and winther therefore argue that seen in this way both lewontin and edwards are right in their arguments they conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions moreover the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions ie splitters or a continuum ie lumpers under kaplan and winthers view racial groupings are objective social constructions see mills 1998 108 that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons in earlier work winther had identified diversity partitioning and clustering analysis as two separate methodologies with distinct questions assumptions and protocols each is also associated with opposing ontological consequences visavis the metaphysics of race 109 philosopher lisa gannett has argued that biogeographical ancestry a concept devised by mark shriver and tony frudakis is not an objective measure of the biological aspects of race as shriver and frudakis claim it is she argues that it is actually just a local category shaped by the u s context of its production especially the forensic aim of being able to predict the race or ethnicity of an unknown suspect based on dna found at the crime scene 110clines and clusters in genetic variation recent studies of human genetic clustering have included a debate over how genetic variation is organized with clusters and clines as the main possible orderings serre  pääbo 2004 argued for smooth clinal genetic variation in ancestral populations even in regions previously considered racially homogeneous with the apparent gaps turning out to be artifacts of sampling techniques rosenberg et al 2005 disputed this and offered an analysis of the human genetic diversity panel showing that there were small discontinuities in the smooth genetic variation for ancestral populations at the location of geographic barriers such as the sahara the oceans and the himalayas nonetheless rosenberg et al 2005 stated that their findings “should not be taken as evidence of our support of any particular concept of biological race genetic differences among human populations derive mainly from gradations in allele frequencies rather than from distinctive diagnostic genotypes using a sample of 40 populations distributed roughly evenly across the earths land surface xing  et al 2010 p 208 found that genetic diversity is distributed in a more clinal pattern when more geographically intermediate populations are sampled guido barbujani has written that human genetic variation is generally distributed continuously in gradients across much of earth and that there is no evidence that genetic boundaries between human populations exist as would be necessary for human races to exist 111over time human genetic variation has formed a nested structure that is inconsistent with the concept of races that have evolved independently of one another 112social constructions main articles race and society and racialism as anthropologists and other evolutionary scientists have shifted away from the language of race to the term population to talk about genetic differences historians cultural anthropologists and other social scientists reconceptualized the term race as a cultural category or social construct ie a way among many possible ways in which a society chooses to divide its members into categories many social scientists have replaced the word race with the word  ethnicity  to refer to selfidentifying groups based on beliefs concerning shared culture ancestry and history  dubious – discuss alongside empirical and conceptual problems with race following the second world war evolutionary and social scientists were acutely aware of how beliefs about race had been used to justify discrimination apartheid slavery and genocide this questioning gained momentum in the 1960s during the civil rights movement in the united states and the emergence of numerous anticolonial movements worldwide they thus came to believe that race itself is a social construct a concept that was believed to correspond to an objective reality but which was believed in because of its social functions 113craig venter and francis collins of the national institute of health jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome in 2000 upon examining the data from the genome mapping venter realized that although the genetic variation within the human species is on the order of 1–3 instead of the previously assumed 1 the types of variations do not support notion of genetically defined races venter said race is a social concept its not a scientific one there are no bright lines that would stand out if we could compare all the sequenced genomes of everyone on the planet when we try to apply science to try to sort out these social differences it all falls apart 114stephan palmié asserted that race is not a thing but a social relation 115 or in the words of katya gibel mevorach a metonym a human invention whose criteria for differentiation are neither universal nor fixed but have always been used to manage difference 116 as such the use of the term race itself must be analyzed moreover they argue that biology will not explain why or how people use the idea of race history and social relationships will imani perry has argued that race is produced by social arrangements and political decision making 117 perry explains race more in stating race is something that happens rather than something that is it is dynamic but it holds no objective truth 118some scholars have challenged the notion that race is primarily a social construction by arguing that race has a biological basis 119 one of the researchers neil risch noted we looked at the correlation between genetic structure based on microsatellite markers versus selfdescription we found 999 concordance between the two we actually had a higher discordance rate between selfreported sex and markers on the x chromosome so you could argue that sex is also a problematic category and there are differences between sex and gender selfidentification may not be correlated with biology perfectly and there is sexism 120brazil main article race in brazil portrait redenção de cam 1895 showing a brazilian family becoming whiter each generation compared to 19thcentury united states 20thcentury brazil was characterized by a perceived relative absence of sharply defined racial groups according to anthropologist marvin harris this pattern reflects a different history and different social relations basically race in brazil was biologized but in a way that recognized the difference between ancestry which determines genotype and phenotypic differences there racial identity was not governed by rigid descent rule such as the onedrop rule as it was in the united states a brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents nor were there only a very limited number of categories to choose from 121 to the extent that full siblings can pertain to different racial groups 122over a dozen racial categories would be recognized in conformity with all the possible combinations of hair color hair texture eye color and skin color these types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum and not one category stands significantly isolated from the rest that is race referred preferentially to appearance not heredity and appearance is a poor indication of ancestry because only a few genes are responsible for someones skin color and traits a person who is considered white may have more african ancestry than a person who is considered black and the reverse can be also true about european ancestry 123 the complexity of racial classifications in brazil reflects the extent of miscegenation in brazilian society a society that remains highly but not strictly stratified along color lines these socioeconomic factors are also significant to the limits of racial lines because a minority of pardos or brown people are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward 124 and being seen as relatively whiter as their perceived social

supposed to choose their race as one among asian and indigenous apart three ibges census categories while assimilated amerindians and people with very high quantities of amerindian ancestry are usually grouped as caboclos a subgroup of pardos which roughly translates as both mestizo and hillbilly for those of lower quantity of amerindian descent a higher european genetic contribution is expected to be grouped as a pardo in several genetic tests people with less than 6065 of european descent and 5–10 of amerindian descent usually cluster with afrobrazilians as reported by the individuals or 69 of the population and those with about 45 or more of subsaharan contribution most times do so in average afrobrazilian dna was reported to be about 50 subsaharan african 37 european and 13 amerindian 127 128 129 130if a more consistent report with the genetic groups in the gradation of miscegenation is to be considered eg that would not cluster people with a balanced degree of african and nonafrican ancestry in the black group instead of the multiracial one unlike elsewhere in latin america where people of high quantity of african descent tend to classify themselves as mixed more people would report themselves as white and pardo in brazil 477 and 424 of the population as of 2010 respectively because by research its population is believed to have between 65 and 80 of

europeans settled in the united states for the same given time 137 thus the historical construction of race in brazilian society dealt primarily with gradations between persons of majority european

the existence of separate human races— directive 200043ec 138the european union uses the terms racial origin and ethnic origin synonymously in its documents and according to it the use of the term racial origin in this directive does not imply an acceptance of such racial theories 138 139  full citation needed haney lópez warns that using race as a category within the law tends to legitimize its existence in the popular imagination in the diverse geographic context of europe ethnicity and ethnic origin are arguably more resonant and are less encumbered by the ideological baggage associated with race in european context historical resonance of race underscores its problematic nature in some states it is strongly associated with laws promulgated by the nazi and fascist governments in europe during the 1930s and 1940s indeed in 1996 the european parliament adopted a resolution stating that the term should therefore be avoided in all official texts 140the concept of racial origin relies on the notion that human beings can be separated into biologically distinct races an idea generally rejected by the scientific community since all human beings belong to the same species the ecri european commission against racism and intolerance rejects theories based on the existence of different races however in its recommendation ecri uses this term in order to ensure that those persons who are generally and erroneously perceived as belonging to another race are not excluded from the protection provided for by the legislation the law claims to reject the existence of race yet penalize situations where someone is treated less favourably on this ground 140france since the end of the second world war france has become an ethnically diverse country today approximately five percent of the french population is noneuropean and nonwhite this does not approach the number of nonwhite citizens in the united states roughly 28–37 depending on how latinos are classified see demographics of the united states  nevertheless it amounts to at least three million people and has forced the issues of ethnic diversity onto the french policy agenda france has developed an approach to dealing with ethnic problems that stands in contrast to that of many advanced industrialized countries unlike the united states britain or even the netherlands france maintains a  colorblind  model of public policy this means that it targets virtually no policies directly at racial or ethnic groups instead it uses geographic or class criteria to address issues of social inequalities it has however developed an extensive antiracist policy repertoire since the early 1970s until recently french policies focused primarily on issues of hate speech – going much further than their american counterparts – and relatively less on issues of discrimination in jobs housing and in provision of goods and services 141united states main article race and ethnicity in the united states see also miscegenation § admixture in the united states and historical racial and ethnic demographics of the united states in the united states there is disagreement on the nature of race within the biological sciences whereas the social constructionist view is dominant in the social sciences over time biological views on race have become more controversial across all disciplines with clear divides along generational cultural and racial lines 142the immigrants to the americas came from every region of europe africa and asia they mixed among themselves and with the indigenous inhabitants of the continent in the united states most people who selfidentify as african–american have some european ancestors while many people who identify as european american have some african or amerindian ancestors since the early history of the united states amerindians african–americans and european americans have been classified as belonging to different races efforts to track mixing between groups led to a proliferation of categories such as mulatto and octoroon the criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century during reconstruction increasing numbers of americans began to consider anyone with  one drop  of known black blood to be black regardless of appearance by the early 20th century this notion was made statutory in many states amerindians continue to be defined by a certain percentage of indian blood called blood quantum  to be white one had to have perceived pure white ancestry the onedrop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention of defining a person as racially black if he or she has any known african ancestry this rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some discernible african ancestry were defined as black the onedrop rule is specific to not only those with african ancestry but to the united states making it a particularly africanamerican experience 143the decennial censuses conducted since 1790 in the united states created an incentive to establish racial categories and fit people into these categories 144the term  hispanic  as an ethnonym emerged in the 20th century with the rise of migration of laborers from the spanishspeaking countries of latin america to the united states today the word latino is often used as a synonym for hispanic the definitions of both terms are nonrace specific and include people who consider themselves to be of distinct races black white amerindian asian and mixed groups 145 however there is a common misconception in the us that hispaniclatino is a race 146 or sometimes even that national origins such as mexican cuban colombian salvadoran etc are races in contrast to latino or hispanic  anglo  refers to nonhispanic white americans or nonhispanic european americans most of whom speak the english language but are not necessarily of english descent views across disciplines over time one result of debates over the meaning and validity of the concept of race is that the current literature across different disciplines regarding human variation lacks consensus though within some fields such as some branches of anthropology there is strong consensus some studies use the word race in its early essentialist taxonomic sense many others still use the term race but use it to mean a population clade or haplogroup others eschew the concept of race altogether and use the concept of population as a less problematic unit of analysis eduardo bonillasilva sociology professor at duke university remarks 147 i contend that racism is more than anything else a matter of group power it is about a dominant racial group whites striving to maintain its systemic advantages and minorities fighting to subvert the racial status quo 148 the types of practices that take place under this new colorblind racism is subtle institutionalized and supposedly not racial colorblind racism thrives on the idea that race is no longer an issue in the united states 148 there are contradictions between the alleged colorblindness of most whites and the persistence of a colorcoded system of inequality  citation needed in poland the race concept was rejected by 25 percent of anthropologists in 2001 although unlike the u s anthropologists polish anthropologists tend to regard race as a term without taxonomic value often as a substitute for population

consensus among them that biological races do not exist in humans but that race does exist insofar as the social experiences of members of different races can have significant effects on health 150wang štrkalj et al 2003 examined the use of race as a biological concept in research papers published in chinas only biological anthropology journal acta anthropologica sinica the study showed that the race concept was widely used among chinese anthropologists 151 152 in a 2007 review paper štrkalj suggested that the stark contrast of the racial approach between the united states and china was due to the fact that race is a factor for social cohesion among the ethnically diverse people of china whereas race is a very sensitive issue in america and the racial approach is considered to undermine social cohesion – with the result that in the sociopolitical context of us academics scientists are encouraged not to use racial categories whereas in china they are encouraged to use them 153lieberman et al in a 2004 study researched the acceptance of race as a concept among anthropologists in the united states canada the spanish speaking areas europe russia and china rejection of race ranged from high to low with the highest rejection rate in the united states and canada a moderate rejection rate in europe and the lowest rejection rate in russia and china methods used in the studies reported included questionnaires and content analysis 10kaszycka et al 2009 in 2002–2003 surveyed european anthropologists opinions toward the biological race concept three factors country of academic education discipline and age were found to be significant in differentiating the replies those educated in western europe physical anthropologists and middleaged persons rejected race more frequently than those educated in eastern europe people in other branches of science and those from both younger and older generations the survey shows that the views on race are sociopolitically ideologically influenced and highly dependent on education 154united states since the second half of the 20th century physical anthropology in the united states has moved away from a typological understanding of human biological diversity towards a genomic and populationbased perspective anthropologists have tended to understand race as a social classification of humans based on phenotype and ancestry as well as cultural factors as the concept is understood in the social sciences 155 since 1932 an increasing number of college textbooks introducing physical anthropology have rejected race as a valid concept from 1932 to 1976 only seven out of thirtytwo rejected race from 1975 to 1984 thirteen out of thirtythree rejected race from 1985 to 1993 thirteen out of nineteen rejected race according to one academic journal entry where 78 percent of the articles in the 1931 journal of physical anthropology employed these or nearly synonymous terms reflecting a biorace paradigm only 36 percent did so in 1965 and just 28 percent did in 1996 156the statement on race 1998 composed by a select committee of anthropologists and issued by the executive board of the american anthropological association as a statement they believe  represents generally the contemporary thinking and scholarly positions of a majority of anthropologists declares 157in the united states both scholars and the general public have been conditioned to viewing human races as natural and separate divisions within the human species based on visible physical differences with the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century however it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous clearly demarcated biologically distinct groups evidence from the analysis of genetics eg dna indicates that most physical variation about 94 lies within socalled racial groups conventional geographic racial groupings differ from one another only in about 6 of their genes this means that there is greater variation within racial groups than between them in neighboring populations there is much overlapping of genes and their phenotypic physical expressions throughout history whenever different groups have come into contact they have interbred the continued sharing of genetic materials has maintained all of humankind as a single species with the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century  it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous clearly demarcated biologically distinct groups  given what we know about the capacity of normal humans to achieve and function within any culture we conclude that presentday inequalities between socalled racial groups are not consequences of their biological inheritance but products of historical and contemporary social economic educational and political circumstances a survey taken in 1985  lieberman et al 1992  asked 1200 american scientists how many disagree with the following proposition there are biological races in the species homo sapiens  the responses were for anthropologistsphysical anthropologists 41cultural anthropologists 53 158the figure for physical anthropologists at ph d granting departments was slightly higher rising from 41 to 42 with 50 agreeing liebermans study also showed that more women reject the concept of race than men 159 this survey however did not specify any particular definition of race although it did clearly specify biological race within the species homo sapiens  it is difficult to say whether those who supported the statement thought of race in taxonomic or population terms the same survey taken in 1999 160 showed the following changing results for anthropologistsphysical anthropologists 69cultural anthropologists 80however a line of research conducted by cartmill 1998 seemed to limit the scope of liebermans finding that there was a significant degree of change in the status of the race concept goran štrkalj has argued that this may be because lieberman and collaborators had looked at all the members of the american anthropological association irrespective of their field of research interest while cartmill had looked specifically at biological anthropologists interested in human variation 161according to the 2000 edition of a popular physical anthropology textbook forensic anthropologists are overwhelmingly in support of the idea of the basic biological reality of human races 162 forensic physical anthropologist and professor george w gill has said that the idea that race is only skin deep is simply not true as any experienced forensic anthropologist will affirm and many morphological features tend to follow geographic boundaries coinciding often with climatic zones this is not surprising since the selective forces of climate are probably the primary forces of nature that have shaped human races with regard not only to skin color and hair form but also the underlying bony structures of the nose cheekbones etc for example more prominent noses humidify air better while he can see good arguments for both sides the complete denial of the opposing evidence seems to stem largely from sociopolitical motivation and not science at all he also states that many biological anthropologists see races as real yet not one introductory textbook of physical anthropology even presents that perspective as a possibility in a case as flagrant as this we are not dealing with science but rather with blatant politically motivated censorship 162in partial response to gills statement professor of biological anthropology c loring brace argues that the reason laymen and biological anthropologists can determine the geographic ancestry of an individual can be explained by the fact that biological characteristics are clinally distributed across the planet and that does not translate into the concept of race he states well you may ask why cant we call those regional patterns races in fact we can and do but it does not make them coherent biological entities races defined in such a way are products of our perceptions  we realize that in the extremes of our transit – moscow to nairobi perhaps – there is a major but gradual change in skin color from what we euphemistically call white to black and that this is related to the latitudinal difference in the intensity of the ultraviolet component of sunlight what we do not see however is the myriad other traits that are distributed in a fashion quite unrelated to the intensity of ultraviolet radiation where skin color is concerned all the northern populations of the old world are lighter than the longterm inhabitants near the equator although europeans and chinese are obviously different in skin color they are closer to each other than either is to equatorial africans but if we test the distribution of the widely known abo bloodgroup system then europeans and africans are closer to each other than either is to chinese 163race is still sometimes used within forensic anthropology when analyzing skeletal remains biomedical research and racebased medicine 164 165 brace has criticized this the practice of forensic anthropologists for using the controversial concept race out of convention when they in fact should be talking about regional ancestry he argues that while forensic anthropologists can determine that a skeletal remain comes from a person with ancestors in a specific region of africa categorizing that skeletal as being black is a socially constructed category that is only meaningful in the particular context of the united states and which is not itself scientifically valid 166in 2007 ann morning interviewed over 40 american biologists and anthropologists and found significant disagreements over the nature of race with no one viewpoint holding a majority among either group morning also argues that a third position antiessentialism which holds that race is not a useful concept for biologists should be introduced into this debate in addition to constructionism and essentialism 167biology anatomy and medicine in the same 1985 survey  lieberman et al 1992  16 of the surveyed biologists and 36 of the surveyed developmental psychologists disagreed with the proposition there are biological races in the species homo sapiens  the authors of the study also examined 77 college textbooks in biology and 69 in physical anthropology published between 1932 and 1989 physical anthropology texts argued that biological races exist until the 1970s when they began to argue that races do not exist in contrast biology textbooks did not undergo such a reversal but many instead dropped their discussion of race altogether the authors attributed this to biologists trying to avoid discussing the political implications of racial classifications instead of discussing them and to the ongoing discussions in biology about the validity of the concept subspecies the authors also noted that some widely used textbooks in biology such as douglas j futuyma s 1986 evolutionary biology had abandoned the race concept the concept of race masking the overwhelming genetic similarity of all peoples and the mosaic patterns of variation that do not correspond to racial divisions is not only socially dysfunctional but is biologically indefensible as well pp 5 18–5 19  lieberman et al 1992 pp 316–17a 1994 examination of 32 english sportexercise science textbooks found that 7 219 claimed that there are biophysical differences due to race that might explain differences in sports performance 24 75 did not mention nor refute the concept and 1 312 expressed caution with the idea 168in february 2001 the editors of archives of pediatrics and adolescent medicine asked authors to not use race and ethnicity when there is no biological scientific or sociological reason for doing so 169 the editors also stated that analysis by race and ethnicity has become an analytical kneejerk reflex 170 nature genetics now ask authors to explain why they make use of particular ethnic groups or populations and how classification was achieved 171morning 2008 looked at high school biology textbooks during the 1952–2002 period and initially found a similar pattern with only 35 directly discussing race in the 1983–92 period from initially 92 doing so however this has increased somewhat after this to 43 more indirect and brief discussions of race in the context of medical disorders have increased from none to 93 of textbooks in general the material on race has moved from surface traits to genetics and evolutionary history the study argues that the textbooks fundamental message about the existence of races has changed little 172surveying views on race in the scientific community in 2008 morning says that they often split along culture and demographic lines and that since liebermans surveys biologists have failed to come to a clear consensus noting that at best one can conclude that biologists and anthropologists now appear equally divided in their beliefs about the nature of race 167gissis 2008 examined several important american and british journals in genetics epidemiology and medicine for their content during the 1946–2003 period he wrote that based upon my findings i argue that the category of race only seemingly disappeared from scientific discourse after world war ii and has had a fluctuating yet continuous use during the time span from 1946 to 2003 and has even become more pronounced from the early 1970s on  17333 health services researchers from differing geographic regions were interviewed in a 2008 study the researchers recognized the problems with racial and ethnic variables but the majority still believed these variables were necessary and useful 174a 2010 examination of 18 widely used english anatomy textbooks found that they all represented human biological variation in superficial and outdated ways many of them making use of the race concept in ways that were current in 1950s anthropology the authors recommended that anatomical education should describe human anatomical variation in more detail and rely on newer research that demonstrates the inadequacies of simple racial typologies 175law blacks law dictionary defines race as  an ethnical stock a great division of mankind sic having in common certain distinguishing physical peculiarities constituting a comprehensive class appearance 176sociology see also sociology of race and ethnic relations lester frank ward 18411913 considered to be one of the founders of american sociology rejected notions that there were fundamental differences that distinguished one race from another although he acknowledged that social conditions differed dramatically by race 177 at the turn of the 20th century sociologists viewed the concept of race in ways that were shaped by the scientific racism of the 19th and early 20th centuries 178 many sociologists focused on african americans called negroes at that time and claimed that they were inferior to whites white sociologist charlotte perkins gilman 1860–1935 for example used biological arguments to claim the inferiority of african americans 178 american sociologist charles h cooley 1864–1929 theorized that differences among races were natural and that biological differences result in differences in intellectual abilities 179 177 edward alsworth ross 18661951 also an important figure in the founding of american sociology and an eugenicist believed that whites were the superior race and that there were essential differences in temperament among races 177 in 1910 the journal published an by ulysses g weatherly 18651940 that called for white supremacy and segregation of the races to protect racial purity 177w e b du bois 1868–1963 one of the first africanamerican sociologists was the first sociologist to use sociological concepts and empirical research methods to analyze race as a social construct instead of a biological reality 178 beginning in 1899 with his book the philadelphia negro du bois studied and wrote about race and racism throughout his career in his work he contended that social class colonialism and capitalism shaped ideas about race and racial categories social scientists largely abandoned scientific racism and biological reasons for racial categorization schemes by the 1930s 180 sociologists associated with the chicago school theorized that notions about race were socially constructed and were not biological 180 in 1978 william julius wilson 1935– argued that race and racial classification systems were declining in significance and that instead social class more accurately described what sociologists had earlier understood as race 181 by 1986 sociologists michael omi and howard winant successfully introduced the concept of racial formation to describe the process by which racial categories are created 182 omi and winant assert that there is no biological basis for distinguishing among human groups along the lines of race 182 today sociologists generally understand race and racial categories as socially constructed and reject racial categorization schemes that depend on biological differences 180political and practical uses biomedicine main article race and health see also pharmacogenomics in the united states federal government policy promotes the use of racially categorized data to identify and address health disparities between racial or ethnic groups 183 in clinical settings race has sometimes been considered in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions doctors have noted that some medical conditions are more prevalent in certain racial or ethnic groups than in others without being sure of the cause of those differences recent interest in racebased medicine or racetargeted pharmacogenomics has been fueled by the proliferation of human genetic data which followed the decoding of the human genome in the first decade of the twentyfirst century there is an active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of race in their research proponents of the use of racial categories in biomedicine argue that continued use of racial categorizations in biomedical research and clinical practice makes possible the application of new genetic findings and provides a clue to diagnosis 184 185 biomedical researchers positions on race fall into two main camps those who consider the concept of race to have no biological basis and those who consider it to have the potential to be biologically meaningful members of the latter camp often base their arguments around the potential to create genomebased personalized medicine 186other researchers point out that finding a difference in disease prevalence between two socially defined groups does not necessarily imply genetic causation of the difference 187 188 they suggest that medical practices should maintain their focus on the individual rather than an individuals membership to any group 189 they argue that overemphasizing genetic contributions to health disparities carries various risks such as reinforcing stereotypes promoting racism or ignoring the contribution of nongenetic factors to health disparities 190 international epidemiological data show that living conditions rather than race make the biggest difference in health outcomes even for diseases that have racespecific treatments 191 some studies have found that patients are reluctant to accept racial categorization in medical practice 185law enforcement this section does not

was brought into question by the office for national statistics ons in september 2007 as part of its equality data review one problem cited was the number of reports that contained an ethnicity of not

african american and latino communities michelle alexander author of the new jim crow mass incarceration in the age of colorblindness 2010 argues that mass incarceration is best understood as not only a system of overcrowded prisons mass incarceration is also the larger web of laws rules policies and customs that control those labeled criminals both in and out of prison 195 she defines it further as a system that locks people not only behind actual bars in actual prisons but also behind virtual bars and virtual walls illustrating the secondclass citizenship that is imposed on a disproportionate number of people of color specifically africanamericans she compares mass incarceration to jim crow laws stating that both work as racial caste systems 196recent work using dna cluster analysis to determine race background has been used by some criminal investigators to narrow their search for the identity of both suspects and victims 197 proponents of dna profiling in

198forensic anthropology main article forensic anthropology similarly forensic anthropologists draw on highly heritable morphological features of human remains eg cranial measurements to aid in the identification of the body including in terms of race in a 1992 article anthropologist norman sauer noted that anthropologists had generally abandoned the concept of race as a valid representation of human biological diversity except for forensic anthropologists he asked if races dont exist why are forensic anthropologists so good at identifying them 199 he concluded the successful assignment of race to a skeletal specimen is not a vindication of the race concept but rather a prediction that an individual while alive was assigned to a particular socially constructed racial category a specimen may display features that point to african ancestry in this country that person is likely to have been labeled black regardless of whether or not such a race actually exists in nature 199identification of the ancestry of an individual is dependent upon knowledge of the frequency and distribution of phenotypic traits in a population this does not necessitate the use of a racial classification scheme based on unrelated traits although the race concept is widely used in medical and legal contexts in the united states 200 some studies have reported that races can be identified with a high degree of accuracy using certain methods such as that developed by giles and elliot however this method sometimes fails to be replicated in other times and places for instance when the method was retested to identify native americans the average rate of accuracy dropped from 85 to 33 62 prior information about the individual eg census data is also important in allowing the accurate identification of the individuals race 201in a different approach anthropologist c loring brace said the simple answer is that as members of the society that poses the question they are inculcated into the social conventions that determine the expected answer they should also be aware of the biological inaccuracies contained in that politically correct answer skeletal analysis provides no direct assessment of skin color but it does allow an accurate estimate of original geographical origins african eastern asian and european ancestry can be specified with a high degree of accuracy africa of course entails black but black does not entail african 202in association with a nova program in 2000 about race he wrote an essay opposing use of the term 203a 2002 study found that about 13 of human craniometric variation existed between regions while 81 existed within regions the other 6 existed between local populations within the same region in contrast the opposite pattern of genetic variation was observed for skin color which is often used to define race with 88 of variation between regions the study concluded that the apportionment of genetic diversity in skin color is atypical and cannot be used for purposes of classification 204 similarly a 2009 study found that craniometrics could be used accurately to determine what part of the world someone was from based on their cranium however this study also found that there were no abrupt boundaries that separated craniometric variation into distinct racial groups 205 another 2009 study showed that american blacks and whites had different skeletal morphologies and that significant patterning in variation in these traits exists within continents this suggests that classifying humans into races based on skeletal characteristics would necessitate many different races being defined 206see also clan cultural identity environmental racism epicanthic fold ethnic nationalism ethnic stereotype history of

can all happily agree that human racial classification is of no social value and is positively destructive of social and human relations that is one reason why i object to ticking boxes on forms and why i object to positive discrimination in job selection but that doesnt mean that race is of virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance this is edwardss point and he reasons as follows however small the racial partition of total variation may be if such racial characteristics as there are highly correlated with other racial characteristics they are by definition informative and therefore of

archives of pediatrics  adolescent medicine 155 no 2 119 in future issues of the archives we ask authors to not use race and ethnicity when there is no biological scientific or sociological reason for doing so race or ethnicity should not be used as explanatory variables when the underlying constructs are variables that can and should be measured directly eg educational level of subjects household income of the families single vs 2parent households employment of parents owning vs renting ones home and other measures of socioeconomic status in contrast the recent attention on decreasing health disparities uses race and ethnicity not as explanatory variables but as ways of examining the underlying sociocultural reasons for these disparities and appropriately targeting attention and resources
