possession of tangible personal property is transferred to the purchaser or the purchasers representative for consideration if a contract of sale does not pass title prior to shipment the sale occurs no later than the time when the retailer completes his or her performance with reference to physical delivery of the property such as when the retailer provides the property to a common carrier for delivery for example your customer ordered a large piece of equipment on august 20 2001 the equipment is shipped on september 5 2001 unless the contract provides otherwise ie a title transfer clause exists the sale occurs when the equipment is provided to the common carrier for shipment to the customer until that time you have not completed the sale back to top do the exemptions apply to leases

and valid exemption certificate partial or otherwise sample exemption certificates for each of the exemptions are available on the boards website or through our information center at 800 4007115 to ensure that you are providing or receiving all the required information to support an exemption we recommend that you use the applicable sample exemption certificates you should also note that you may accept a properly completed and valid blanket exemption certificate covering all qualified purchases made by a qualified person in lieu of a specific exemption certificate for each purchase a qualified person need not fill out an exemption certificate for each individual purchase i am a seller of equipment and machinery that qualifies for an exemption when customers request the exemption what description should they use for type of tangible personal property purchased the description of property purchased on a partial exemption certificate should be as clear as possible if you are a retailer of packing equipment the description on the partial exemption certificate should say packing equipment if you are a retailer who sells many types of items a description of the type of property sold should be acceptable for example if you operate a hardware store selling hand tools nuts bolts and motor oil all of which are purchased by a qualified person for a qualified use the description on the partial exemption certificate could read agricultural tools and parts for farm machinery and equipment you should consider taking a specific partial exemption certificate for large or unusual purchases for example a tractor dealer may want to obtain a specific partial exemption certificate on the sale of a farm tractor and rely on a blanket certificate for sales of tractor parts and tools similarly if a customer insists on an exemption for property that normally does not appear to qualify as farm equipment and machinery you should obtain a specific certificate on the sale please note that an unclear description can leave a retailer open to questions of good faith for example a partial exemption certificate issued to a hardware store with the description all purchases may raise questions as to whether the certificate was accepted in good faith since both the vendor and purchaser know that some purchases made pursuant to that certificate may not qualify for the exemption back to top what is meant by the statement that an exemption certificate must be taken timely and in good faith for exemption purposes the exemption certificate partial or otherwise will be considered timely if it is taken any time before the retailer bills the purchaser for the qualified propertywithin the retailers normal billing or payment cycleat or prior to delivery of the qualified property to the purchaser or his or her representative or no later than 15 days after the date of purchase a seller cannot accept an exemption certificate partial or otherwise in good faith when the seller knows or should have reasonably known that the property is not subject to an exemption or will not be used in an exempt manner how long does a retailer need to keep exemption certificates that support claimed exempt sales a retailer must retain each exemption certificate partial or otherwise and any other documentation received from a purchaser for a period of not less than four years from the date on which the retailer claims an exemption partial or otherwise based on the exemption certificate more information regarding the retention of sales records and other such documents is
