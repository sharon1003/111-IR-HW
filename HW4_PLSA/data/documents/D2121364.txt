tools for cutting it as it had played havoc on motors in the past ill have to look at the tear down video again to see if the ts55 has lots of seals but most tools capture dust well so it may be a

to most all cleaners and disinfectants it can be cut with any saw using a fine blade although carbide is best the thing to avoid is vibration it is a brittle material so support it from below and keep your saw tight to the material cutting it is much like cutting phenolics or thin acrylicswear a dust mask and goggles we used to distribute it but my plastics supplier ain actually told me to buy from

or other composites is very harmful to the body and just as bad for electrical components especially motors i really would not want to cut it with my ts unless you have extremely good extraction and ppe and the right blade which would be a carbide or continuous diamond the blades can get very hot and damage the material and the bladetool i have found a very thin kerf continuous diamond disk on a grinder to be good but im not sure exactly what you are cutting or the thickness all the best and wear a p3 mask logged jeff r johnson posts 90re best way to cut frp« reply 18 on september 07 2015
