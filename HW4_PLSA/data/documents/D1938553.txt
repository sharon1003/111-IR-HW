seal the floor so spills dont ruin itflooring sealing laminateshare improve this questionasked sep 23 14 at 2003lounge9121 1 1 41are you talking about laminate picture of wood over mdf or engineered hardwood real wood veneer over plywood or mdf – i like dirt sep 23 14 at 2030i like dirt probably laminate picture of wood over mdf but im not sure what are your thoughts on either – lounge9 oct 13 14 at 911some manufacturers egger in particular advise customers to do it particularly for commercial installations and they even make their own sealant stripex you can see it in this video or explained in a brochure on page 6 i dont know how effective the sealant is hence this as a comment but some answers below saying you should never do it are definitely wrong since some manufacturers advise it – fizz jun 6 17 at 024add a comment6 answers active oldest votesup vote3down vote there are lots of grades of laminate flooring when i say lots maybe hundreds these are the main things that figure in on how moisture will affect your laminate almost all apply to engineered wood locking system i have put together some laminate that have a very loose locking system to the point where there are tiny gaps not an install issue just design flaw any top layer gaps cause liquid to get under quickly a good floor should retain a large puddle until it evaporates i have two different types of flooring in my house that would do this  engineered hardwood and rubber laminate padding some laminates come with padding built in if yours didnt hopefully they spent the 100 to buy a few rolls the padding creates a slight elevation to keep some moisture off the bottom of the flooring and contributes in other ways backing this is really all over the place laminate can be backed by rubber high end but getting cheaper cork high end mdf normal layered wood normal to high end plywood grade normal and then things in between each has different properties i could sit my rubber laminate in a pool for a year and it would still be rubber cork handles low amounts of water well but will be totally jacked up in a big flood mdf and plywood are the main ones known to expand on big spills this is probably what your realtor was thinking of layered wood sheets wont last with longterm water but anything shortterm it handles well i personally would never buy laminate or engineered hardwood with plywoodmdf backing top material this is probably the least important but some laminates scratch easily and if yours gets big scratches then obviously it leads a place for water to bleed thickness i cant find any scientific proof but i know that i have seen a lot more 14 laminate warped versus 12 the thin stuff is made for apartment buildings but gets used in some questionable areas of homes installation definitely the 1 reason not having expansion gaps water gets in wood expands out of room warps  where it may have been fine after drying out not locking the planks together firmlyproperly  leaving big gaps in floor uneven subfloor that promotes bowing water pooling and flexing wrong install method  gluing or nailing flooring that should float basically laminate is just as durable as wood or anything else as long as you get the right product for your installation a few bedrooms in a high rise can take about anything i use a popular rubber backed brand from hd for bathrooms or kitchens in high traffic areas of residential homes i want at least 38 and sheeted the horror stories with laminate are mostly due to wrong product or install for the need if you post a picture of your laminate side view i could tell you more can you seal it sure will the sealant be affective longterm i doubt it when you paint and spill drops on a laminate floor you can usually just wipe off the dried paint it already has a finish on it its finish will not support many binding agents without a lot of materials involved this is much different from wood and polyshare improve this answeranswered oct 13 14

floor if there were significant flooding the laminate and almost any real wood floor would be at risk of damage beyond repair almost no floor is truly waterproofshare improve this answeranswered sep

gloss semi gloss matte or flat finish i did this 3 years ago and it still looks new good luckshare improve this answeranswered may 18 15 at 146user3765911 1add a commentup vote1down vote laminate flooring is not supposed to be sealed after its made and installed its made with a protective coating and is impregnable which means any type of topical solution will not sink into the floor it will lay on the top attracting dust and evenly will yellow and flake off if you spill water clean it up as soon as possible if you let it sit it will sink in and make the underpart swell and boards will start to pop upshare improve this answeredited sep 21 15 at 1758niall c ♦194k 13 71 114answered sep 20 15 at 050user4371811 1add a commentup vote0down vote laminate flooring is intended to be cheap readily disposable and resilient against scuffs and scrapes against moisture it is much more vulnerable due to the mdf core the top layer is already sealed but moisture will eventually work its way between the planks and i dont believe theres any practical way to seal these gaps its simply not intended for this youll probably be fine as long as there isnt a major spill that never gets cleaned up but if the floor ever experiences a big one or a flood its a goner in that case if you want to stay with wood i would recommend replacing it with real hardwood or engineered hardwood with a plywood core and a thick 3mm veneer layer which will allow it to be refinished once or twice should it get severely damaged either of these will be substantially more moisturetolerant than mdfcore laminate

will be a little more water resistant but if you try to pull it up it will not be able to be reusedshare improve this answeredited sep 28 16 at 1259rob566 1 6 18answered nov 21 15 at 1409eric1add a
