t3 t4 tsh trh calcitonin what hormones are collectively known as thyroid hormones t3 t4what are t3 and t4 also known as triiodothyronine thyroxine what is thyroxine made up of 4 iodinated tyrosine residues what is the peak effect of thyroxine on target tissues takes 11 days what are triiodothyronine made up of 3 iodinated tyrosine residues what is the peak effect of triiodothyronine target tissues is more rapid takes 3 days what does t3  t4  thyroid hormones what is trh thyroid releasing hormone what is tsh thyroid stimulating hormone what are the requirements for hormone replacement trh tshwhat is needed for the formation of t3 and t4 dietary iodine such as iodized salt what is the goiter belt midwest northwest and greatlakes have soil and water that are low in iodine this precipitates goiter formation what are goiters from the goiter belt termed as endemic goiters what are goiters caused by nutritional deficiency of iodine where are goiters most often seen adolescents pregant and lactating women what does tsh regulate synthesis of t3 and t4 production what happens as t4 gets low thyroid is stimulated to produce more thyroid hormone it is stimulated to produce more t3 and t4 tsh regulates the synthesis of t3 and t4 trh is stimulated by exposure to cold environment why is trh stimulated in cold environment try to increase metabolism what is the function of t3 and t4 control metabolism of all cells regulate protein cho carbohydrates and fat metabolism aids in neural and skeletal development in fetus and infants what is the function of calcitonin lowers serum calcium and phosphate levels by inhibiting bone resorption what does thyroid hormone serve to do increase metabolism increase heat production as in acclimation to cold environments promotes growth

small amount of blood is placed on a filter type paper that is tested for an array of tests depending on the errors in metabolism endemic to a particular area and some standard tests like thyroid function hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell galactosemia and phenylketonuria pkuwhat can congenital hypothyroidism cause permanent retardation  if not treated within first 6weeks of life with thyroid hormones how is congenital hypothyroidism detected through newborn metabolic screening blood test at 2448 hours of life including pku testwhat tests are manditory in newborn screening in all 50 states pku hgb a1c what is hyperthyroidism highy preventable endocrine disorder metabolism speeds up what nutritional needs are needed for hyperthyroidism nutritional needs for increased metabolism would include increasing calories and protein a diet of 40005000 calories is needed to prevent weight loss from negative nitrogen balance increased protein will aid in the nitrogen balance and help alleviate wieght loss what are the types of hyperthyroidsim primary secondary what happens in hyperthyroidism hyperfunctioning of entire thyroid gland adenomas of thyroid cancer what is primary

for 68 hours before test what happens in a radioactive iodine uptake scan radioactive iodine is introduced into the body and is then measured in the urine collected over 24hr period a scintillition scanner measurees the amount of radioactive iodine taken up by the thyroid the thyroid is scanned 24 horus afer adminsitration of the radioactive iodine which is given either po or iv measurements may be taken in 24hr increments and then at 24hrs radioactive iodine uptake is increased in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism what happens in a thyroid ultrasound a radiographic procedure
