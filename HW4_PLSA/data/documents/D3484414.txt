valve faqwhat are the advantages of air actuation over solenoid actuation solenoid actuation requires the presence of electric switches wires and all of the shielding necessary to reduce spark hazard and personal risk air actuation requires only 3way air pilot valves and tubing there is no explosion spark or shock risk and the components are less expensive to buy is it possible to convert an air signal into an electrical signal mead airtoelectric switches will turn an air signal into an electrical signal what does cv mean literally cv means coefficient of velocity cv is generally used to compare flows of valves the higher the cv the greater the flow it is sometimes helpful to convert cv into scfm standard cubic feet per minute and conversely scfm into cv although cv represents flow capacity at all pressures scfm represents flow at a specific air pressure therefore the following chart relates cv to scfm at a group of pressures to obtain scfm output at a particular pressure divide the valve cv by the appropriate factor shown below cv to scfm conversion factor table psi of air pressure 40 50 60 70 80 90 100factor 00370 00312 00270 00238 00212 00192 00177example what is the output in scfm of a value with a cv of 048 when operated at 100 psi 048 cv00177 factor  27scfm to convert scfm into cv simply reverse the process and multiply the scfm times factor previous next
