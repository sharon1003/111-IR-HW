cancel sending scores after the test if we select universities befor the test2 how our scores will calculate if we take the test several times reply lucas february 19 2015 at 1130 am i can answer those1 no if you select schools to send scores for free before the test you have until 10 pm the day before the test to changedelete the schools after that time any toefl scores that you get will be sent to all the free schools listed for that specific test date 2 previous test scores don’t influence other scores the score reports are sent separately if you choose in june to send your june test score to school a then send your november test score to school a again they will see both scores but if you do not select any free score reports and pay to choose after you take the test you can choose which test date’s report you want to send the other dates’ reports will not be sent so if i you take a june test then a november test and don’t choose any schools until december then in december you can choose whether to send june scores or november scores but you have to pay 19 for each school you send to see more here reply nicolas july 10 2016 at 1002 pm lucasare you 100 sure

planning to apply for requires minimum of 17 in all the section is it possible to send 2 score cards to same university so that i can prove i got more than their cut off score help thanks magoosh test prep expert december 13 2016 at 956 am hi sachinvery few universities will accept two combinedbutseparate toefl score reports to prove your english ability it’s likely you’ll have to actually retake the exam another time i’m sorry to give you that bad news as this situation certainly does sound frustrating one last point though– sometimes individual universities have surprising policies or are willing to be flexible on score reporting and score requirements so i strongly encourage you to contact your school and ask them if they’ll accept your two score reports as you’ve described it can’t hurt to ask and the worst they could say is “no”simone june 22 2017 at 557 am hi i have tried to give my 4 free score recipients however when i go to the order page im being charged 80 for it  magoosh

am unable to add any score recipients in the ‘view order s’ link how do i proceed reply rachel wisuri september 15 2015 at 1010 am hi amithis sounds like a problem with the ets website i’d suggest logging out of your account closing all of your browsing windows and trying again if the problem persists you’ll need to contact ets reply samuel anim yeboah september 9 2015 at 1239 am hello how are you my name is samuel anim yeboah i have once taken toefl test in 2004 in ghana but unfortunately i have misplaced my results slip i want to know if there is a possibility of having a copy because i need it urgently to attach to my documents for school thank you and hoping to hear from you soon good day reply rachel wisuri september 15 2015 at 1014 am hi samuelin this case i would recommend contacting ets — they are the only ones who may have record of your exam results however that said toefl results are only valid for 2 years so if the school you are applying to requires valid results you’ll need to take the exam again best of luckreplyjaffer september 12 2015 at 720 pm hi i have toefl exam on septemeber 13th 2015 and deadlines of most of the universities i applied are on 1st october i want to know by any chance if they can reach on or before the deadline also as i have already sent rest of the documents so is there a way i can ask them for giving 45 days grace time for the scores to reach them thank you reply rachel wisuri september 15 2015 at 1007 am hi jafferyou’re going to be cutting it really close with that deadline — typically scores take minimum 20 days to arrive at universities scores are released 13 days after your exam and then take at least 7 days in the mail that’s best case scenario i’d suggest contacting the school you’re applying to and telling them about your situation if they know your scores are on their way they might be flexible with the deadline best of luckreply manthan september 15 2015 at 1016 pm is it possible for me to see the scores before sending them out to the schools i mean i don’t want the schools to see my scores until i find them satisfactory enough to be sent socan i just not fill the recipient list in my ets account and fill it afterwards when the results are out can i use those four free choices after taking the test reply rachel wisuri september 18 2015 at 1007 am hi manthanunfortunately you won’t be able to use the 4 free score reports after you take the test you have to select the recipients before your test date if you want the free reports if you want to wait to see your score you’ll need to pay to send the score reports replydipendra may 19 2016 at 255 am even i tried but how do i pay for the four free university score reports reply magoosh test prep expert may 21 2016 at 326 pm if you tried to get your four score reports before the deadline for free score reporting 10pm on the day before the exam it should have worked but if something went wrong and the process didn’t work contact toefl customer service they should be able to help you figure out what went wrong and help you get your four free toefl score reports sent out reply arun september 16 2015 at 244 am hii had undertaken the toefl exam in india on sep 5th 2015 and the results got published on 15th sep how long will it take for the scores to be sent to the universities i had selected earlier any way to track the status there is no change in the list i had updated it is still shown as ordered besides the university name reply rachel wisuri september 18 2015 at 1005 am hi arunit will take at least 710 days for your scores to arrive at the universities but it’s possible it will take longer in order to track the status i’d suggest emailing ets replyhadi october 30 2015 at 520 pm hi is it possible to request free official score report to be sent to the four universities after the test  immediately after the test has finished to the responsible staff during the test event or is it only restricted for the participant to request it prior to the test  the day before  so i will have a better insight about my test before decide to send it thanks reply shradha september 16 2015 at 415 am hiif i take up the toefl exam in jan is it possible to send the score to free universities when fall deadline opens up say after 6 months  or will i be charged for sending score to every university after the test  thanks reply rachel wisuri september 18 2015 at 1004 am hi shradhaunfortunately you’ll be charged if you send your score reports anytime after your exam in your case even though you’ll be sending your scores to universities really early you should still go ahead and arrange for them to be sent before your test — universities will simply put your scores on file until you’re ready to complete the rest of your application reply ishan k september 23 2015 at 1213 pm hii want to send email to an unlisted institute i contacted toefl and they gave the below procedure but the button mentioned in point 6 “add an unlisted recipient” does not exists on my screen any advice dear candidateplease be informed that in case you wish to send the scores to an institute which is not listed under toefl list kindly follow the following steps1 login to your toefl i bt profile accessed through the toefl website at httpwwwetsorgtoefl 2 click “register for a testorder score reports” 3 click “toefl services” click “continue” 4 click “additional score report s” 5 select the appropriate test date click “continue” 6 now you can click for the option “add an unlisted recipient” and update the full details of the institue to which scores have to be sent 7 you may add another score recipient in same order 8 click “continue” 9 click” confirm order” 10 enter credit card details click “submit payment” reply lucas fink september 28 2015 at 138 pm hi ishani believe that you can only send scores to an unlisted school after you have taken the test in other words i think it is impossible to choose an unlisted school as one of the four free score reports if you haven’t yet taken the test that would be why “add unlisted recipient” doesn’t appear for you but if you want to be sure i recommend asking ets directly reply zehra march 14 2016 at 311 am hello with this procedures are they sending our reports electronically can you please help me with that i am running out of time reply ujjwal september 29 2015 at 1027 pm how to correct my date of in my score report i have contacted ets but they only changed my date of birth in my online toefl account is it really a big problem for me to get admission in case of slight mistake in date of birth reply lucas fink september 30 2015 at 933 am that’s tricky i don’t believe it would cause any issue—especially not if you notified the schools you were applying to of the discrepancy and your attempt to fix it via ets but to be honest this is a rare problem and i’m not certain i’d definitely recommend emailing ets once more to try to get it completely sorted good luckreply top october 3 2015 at 758 am hii took the test twiceand both times i sent my scores to 4 universities the second time i had a worse score than the first one i want to know which score these universities will take under consideration the first which was the better or the last which was lower thanks in advance reply lucas fink october 12 2015 at 340 pm this depends on the school and program but to my knowledge they usually consider both scores with more focus on the higher one i’d definitely recommend contacting programs you’re applying to to be surereply natalia october 5 2015 at 1125 am hihow long do the universities keep the test scores i will take the exam on nov2015 and i plan on applying in the end of 2016 will they still have my scores

score recipients now i need to send my score to universities and to do so i added the universities and tried to pay for my scores being sent but the thing is they are not processing my purchase and so

accountreply joel november 10 2015 at 1022 am hi i have never taken toefl tests and i don’t know how does the stuff with scores work in my case the university i want to apply to ask me not to submit the language certificate by using toefltse institution code instead they ask me to make a scan of the certificate and put it directly in my application form my question is if am i going to receive a certification or something like a pdf with my results after the exam or anything showing my scores i can use to send by myself reply david recine november 12 2015 at 959 pm yes some universities and other organizations do ask for toefl scores in the way you’ve described joel you should be able to receive an email regarding your toefl scores that can be converted to pdf and you have the ability to download results form the ets website that can also be formatted as a digital certificate and of course ets can also mail you the results so that you can send a scanned or printed copy to the university reply awais mirza november 11 2015 at 834 am how to add toefl recipient university if it does not have an institution code the university wants to receive test score directly from ets but

i do have the address of the university please reply soon as i will have to enter the recipient before 1000 hrs tomorrow november 12 2015 reply david recine november 12 2015 at 1010 pm hi awaiswhat a frustrating situation it’s uncommon but not unheard of for a university to accept toefl but not have a working toefl code in these situations you should be given an option to simply “custom choose” a recipient and request that ets transmit your score results to a destination of your choice either by mail or electronically if you can’t see how to do this on the ets site contact the toefl administrators by phone tomorrow and they should be able to tell you how to send your scores without a toefl code go to this link httpswwwetsorgtoeflcontact  then select your country of residence form the dropdown menu and the toefl customer service number you need to call will come up replysaketh november 11 2015 at 1052 pm hii took my exam last year and i am applying now how long does it take for

35 business days for your scores to reach universities typically it takes about 710 days if you’re worried that your scores won’t arrive on time you should contact ets to ask them for more information

you’ll need to contact etsreply rasmus boesgaard november 29 2015 at 319 pm hii haven’t made a final decision on which universities to apply for yet but now is a very good time for me to take the toefl test if i take the test now but don’t file for admissions before next fallwinter fall 2017 admission will the 4 free recipients have kept my scores then or would i have to send score reports again 12 months from now thank you reply david recine december 4 2015 at 337 pm hi rasmusgenerally if universities are sent your toefl score when they don’t have any other application materials on file for you they won’t know what to do with the score reports and may delete them or throw them away if you’d like to send score reports to universities you haven’t applied to yet contact them in advance and see if they are willing to take your scores let hem know that you haven’t finished the other parts of the application yet and ask them if they can keep your score reports on file while you work on the rest of your application your comment is awaiting mo reply manan ghelani december 1 2015 at 609 am hellowhile sending my toefl scores to the university i made a mistake by selecting “department for any other department not listed”as i wish to apply for masters in an engineering field will i have to resend the scores to that university with it’s department code or it isn’t required as the university would have received the score thank you reply david recine december 4 2015 at 328 pm i’ve found that usually as long as the score makes it to the university itself the admissions office is able to quickly send it to the correct department however this doesn’t happen 100 of the time and sometimes not specifying a department can create delays or complications contact the university you applied to explain what happened and ask them if there’s anything you need to do to make sure your application is seen and properly processed reply david recine december 4 2015 at 337 pm hi rasmusgenerally if universities are sent your toefl score when they don’t have any other application materials on file for you they won’t know what to do with the score reports and may delete them or throw them away if you’d like to send score reports to universities you haven’t applied to yet contact them in advance and see if they are willing to take your scores let hem know that you haven’t finished the other parts of the application yet and ask them if they can keep your score reports on file while you work on the rest of your application reply damanpreet december 2 2015 at 836 am hiwhile listing free universities i entered correct university code but my department code was wrong for instance for ubc univ code is 0965 and dept code is 78 but for all 4 the universities univ code is correct but department code is 99 so do i need to submit my scores again to the universities reply david recine december 4 2015 at 333 pm hi damanpeet in my own experience getting the department code wrong is usually not a big issue most admissions offices will catch the mistake and forward your application to the right department but it’s better to be safe than sorry you should definitely contact the universities you’ve applied to and let them know about the contradiction in department codes the universities will tell you if anything needs to be done to fix that reply sam december 14 2015 at 1224 pm why magoosh does not have a contact number please clarify reply rachel wisuri december 14 2015 at 235 pm hey samwe do have a contact number but we prefer that students email us at helpmagooshcom this is easiest since we’re located in california but a lot of our students are located outside the us so we don’t have to worry about time zonesreply sam december 14 2015

universities the deadline was 15th december i have ordered gre and toefl scores to be sent to universities one day before the deadline is it okay that the scores reach the universities after the deadline reply david recine december 18 2015 at 730 am congratulations on finally reaching the application phase of your upcoming studyabroad experienceit’s generally best to send your toefl scores in before the application deadline some universities may be willing to wait until after the deadline for your toefl scores if everything else has already been submitted to know about this for sure contact the admissions offices of the three universities you’ve applied to and ask them if they can accept slightly late toefl scores replysummerpage january 4 2016 at 915 pm hello i’ve made the biggest mistake of my life the deadline for my application is 29th january i’m applying for a school in japan however i just ordered my score report yesterday there is no way it can arrive on time what should i do is there any way to make my report arrive sooner i know that if they use the ems service it may only take 3 days can i pay more money or contact them somehow please help me i totally desperate now reply david recine january 8 2016 at 254 pm so sorry to hear this is happening to you there are several digital score reporting options that may work for getting your score to the school more quickly ets lists these here httpswwwetsorgtoeflinstitutionsscoresreporting  you’ll have to talk to your school to see if these are options if you yourself have access to your score already— either via internet or in print— your school may be willing to accept a forwarded copy directly from you but this depends a lot on the school to see if your school will accept the scores through a different delivery method you’ll want to call them it doesn’t hurt to explain your situation even if they don’t generally accept digital scores or scores directly from the test taker it’s worth asking for an exception you should also check and see if they may be willing to accept your scores a little late so long as all the other application materials are in it may also be a good idea to call toefl customer service perhaps even by phone a list of customer service contacts which vary from country to country is here httpswwwetsorgtoeflcontactother  if ets can already see your scores maybe a conference call between you them and the admissions office at your university could help contact toefl and your school to troubleshoot this very worrisome problem and if you can come back here to the comments field and let us know how it goes reply ana january 9 2016 at 623 pm hi everybody i have a really big worry i took the test in december 12 2015 i registered online to take the toefl and i chose to see my scores just online i considered unnecessary to receive it at home because i can generate the pdf and print but the thing is that i don’t know if the university will receive my results by post mail or just electronically because it was not specified how they are going to send the results i just filled the university’s toefl code i am really worried because the university requires the score paper to be delivered straight from ets thanks in advancereply gulnaaz january 10 2016 at 1044 am hello i appeared for my toefl exam last april i’d sent my scores to the university at that time now after almost a year i am sending the same scores to the same university so will i’ve to pay for my toefl scores to be sent to them again or will the university have my scores in their system please give me some clarity on this front thank you so much gulnaaz reply david recine january 11 2016 at 246 pm most university admissions offices will keep your previous scores on file for at least a year but polices vary and sometimes records can be lost or misplaced by accident contact your university to make sure they still have the scores you previously sent in reply david recine january 11 2016 at 301 pm no worries ana the reason the toefl website doesn’t give you a choice between mailing or sending scores electronically because there is no choice if you enter your prospective university code to request that official scores be sent there toefl will always send printed scores by mail your university’s requirements will be met reply majed january 12 2016 at 1033 am hello how much time does it take for my toefl scores to be received electronically by the universities that i listed as score recipients  thank you so much reply david recine january 14 2016 at 1002 pm that’s a great question majed— and a surprisingly complicated oneas i mentioned above official scores are sent only by mail however ets offers several ways for universities to view your unofficial scores online before the official ones have arrived by these electronic viewing methods universities can view your unofficial scores as soon as you’re able to view them a list of electronic score viewing services can be found here httpswwwetsorgtoeflinstitutionsscoresreporting these services are offered directly to universities not to test takers and admissions offices can only view your scores through these services if their university has purchased the service from ets so you’ll need to check with prospective universities to see if they’re able to electronically view your unofficial scores while they wait for the official scores to come in reply saifullahi shehu imam january 14 2016 at 155 pm hello… i have taken toefl since december 19th 2015 and the result is already out i have successfully ordered for my result to be sent to a selected university in saudi arabia please how do i know if ets has delivered the result thank you reply tim january 20 2016 at 240 pm hello i am looking at how to send my test results to the university electronically as it says that they must be submitted electronically and not by mail when i select to send the scores to them it says that they will mail it to the university how do i make sure they submit the scores electronically thank you reply david recine january 22 2016 at 612 pm usually when a university asks for electronic scores the school itself has direct access to electronic scores through ets data manager or servertoserver feed details on these electronic reporting methods can be found here httpswwwetsorgtoeflinstitutionsscoresreporting these two methods of electronic toefl score delivery are arranged directly between ets and participating schools if the university you’re applying to uses one of these services you’ll probably need to give certain personal information directly to the university so they can look up your score in ets’s database it’s also possible that the university wants you to receive the scores yourself then send them scanned copies via fax or email this is a much less common practice but i’ve seen some schools accept toefl scores that way either way you’ll need to contact your university and double check to see exactly what they want and what you need to do reply james january 26 2016 at 422 pm hello please i am have issues with viewing my recipient schools that is how can i view the schools i chose for my scores to be delivered to many thanks in advance reply david recine january 28 2016 at 907 pm sorry your’e having trouble viewing the schools you need to transmit your toefl scores to that sounds frustrating in cases like this it’s hard to say whether this is a matter of technical problems with the ets website or difficulty finding the right buttons to click on the interface to make sure you get the best most uptodate technical help your best option is to directly contact toefl customer service  httpswwwetsorgtoeflcontact  they can usually clear up issues like this fairly quickly reply nikta february 1 2016 at 145 pm hi i have taken the tofel test 12112015 and i have not recieved my score yet i got an email 4 weeks ago from ets and they mentioned that my test is under administration review could someone please clarify what is administration review and how long more do i need to wait to get my official or unofficial score i appreciate a response thank reply david recine february 2 2016 at 225 pm hi niktathat’s definitely an unusual situation i’m sorry to hear you’re going through this it’s not common for scores to be held up in administrative review but ets does this in rare cases“administrative review” basically means that there’s been a delay in either the scoring of an exam or the releasing of the scores the reasons for these delays can vary administrative review covers quite a few different problems if you get a message that your score is under administrative review you should call or email ets toefl customer service asap to get the details to look up the toefl customer service contact information for your country go here httpswwwetsorgtoeflcontact you should be able to clear things up once you contact ets good luck and if you can let us know how it goes niktareplysweyasha sharma february 1 2016 at 544 pm hi i need a help out here i have got my toefl on feb 6 and i placed the order for scores and since i have not taken my test i get a chance to send the scores for free right but why am i being charged for it  reply david recine february 4 2016 at 902 pm yes this is early enough before the test that you should have been able to select up to four schools to receive scores without being charged any extra money if you’ve been charged incorrectly you should be able to reverse the charges by contacting toefl customer service you can find the phone number and email for your country’s toefl customer support office by going here httpswwwetsorgtoeflcontact reply mary february 19 2016 at 141 pm hello please i want to ask you question i took my toefl test on february 062016 ets sent me email to tell me that my scores will be delay because they are under administrative review what that means  is there any problem with that how long it takes usually in such situation thanks reply david recine february 22 2016 at 450 pm sorry to hear this is happening to you mary administrative review covers a really wide variety of situations— anything from test center error to accidental loss of data as the scores are transmitted from one place to another to missing or unclear id information on the test taker… and many other possibilities if your scores have been delayed due to administrative review you won’t know how long the delay will take— or if there’s anything you can do to speed things up— unless you contact toefl customer service to get the details on what happened so i recommend calling or emailing toefl customer service as soon as possible you can find the contact information for toefl in your country by checking the dropdown menu here httpswwwetsorgtoeflcontact reply tess29 february 21 2016 at 620 am hi  i have ordered few days ago a score report to an institution but i forgot to change the email where i should receive the “order receipt confirmation”  because the center where i took the test was responsible for my registration so in the contact information was their email instead of mine and i didn’t pay attention to this earlier now i want to know if the status ” ordered” in order summury on my account means that the operation was succesfull and they have sent a confirmation on that email i’m trying to contact my center today to make it sure but i’m not receiving a reply it’s sunday i also need to know how long approximately drawing on people’s experiences  does the report take to reach a destination in berlin for example it is written in my order that the shipping day is feb 29 and my application deadline is march 31  is there a chance to be there on time thank you reply david recine february 22 2016 at 442 pm hi tesswhat a complicated situationto address your first concern about the confirmation email— the main purpose of putting your email into the order form is to simply get confirmation that you sent the order as long as your account shows that it’s been ordered and has a projected shipping day you should be fine getting your scores sent from ets to a university in berlin in just 4 days will be more of a problem it’s not impossible for this to happen sometimes mailings from the us can get to berlin in a week or less however the us postal service doesn’t guarantee that short of a time and mail transit from america to germany can take much longer this is why the toefl says you should allow 4 to 6 weeks for delivery to institutions outside of the usa you should definitely contact your prospective school in germany and let them know the score report might arrive late see if they’re willing to wait for the score and if they might also be willing to accept screenshots of your toefl scores once you’re able to access them online also check to see if they’re eligible for this electronic toefl score receipt option httpmagooshcomtoefl2016cantoeflscoresbesentelectronicallyit might not hurt to contact ets customer service too just to make sure your scores really are going out as soon as possible httpswwwetsorgtoeflcontact a lot of schools are understanding if the official score mailer arrives a little late good luck as you sort this pout and let magoosh know how it all goes if possible reply tess29 february 28 2016 at 405 pm thank you for your reply but what do you mean by “getting your scores sent from ets to berlin in just 4 days will be more of a problem”  as i said there are 4 months4 days between the shipping date feb 29 and the application deadline march 31l so according to you it is so bad reply david recine march 16 2016 at 1142 am tess— how embarrassing sorry i misread that there i’m not quite sure how i misread the shipping date and arrival deadline but clearly i got those quite wrong a fourweek delivery is actually quite likely even though the toefl website says it can take as much as 6 weeks delivery by march 31 is not 100 guaranteed of course so you still may want to discuss the possibility of late delivery with your school and make contingency plans as i described above but with a month between delivery and deadline you’re very likely to be ok reply tk1 february 25 2016 at 710 am hello i took the test on 12th december 2015 and i have received my score online however i’ve been waiting for 2 months but haven’t seen any delivery at all alsoi accident wrote the wrong address but the correct postal code i would like to ask if my official test score report will be sent to the postal office in my country thanksreply mary february 25 2016 at 840 pm thanks a lot mr david for replying to my question i already called ets before i wrote my comment here but they told me that it is still earlier to ask about my score although i told them that i received this email but they ask me to wait and till now there is nothing i will wait to the beginning of march to call them again and ask i hope that they will give me a good reason to understand what should i do thanks again  reply david recine february 26 2016 at 639 pm sorry to hear about this frustrating delay with the wrong address any number of things could go wrong one thing you’ll want to do is log in to your ets account and see if your score reports are marked as sent in toefl’s official system if so it’s likely that toefl did send the scores but they got lost in the mail and if not contact ets customer service to see why the scores haven’t been sent yet httpswwwetsorgtoeflcontact since there was a problem with the address itself it seems likely the scores were sent but couldn’t be delivered to their final destination it certainly is a good idea to check with your local post office and see if they did receive the scores and either held the mail or returned it to sender if the post office hasn’t seen the scores and ets has marked them as sent then they’re lost and you’ll need to request a resend reply david recine march 16 2016 at 1144 am glad i could help mary although i’m sorry ets hasn’t been able to provide an answer for you just yet hopefully this can all be resolved nicely for you soon reply josh february 29 2016 at 1103 pm hello i’ve written the toefl test earlier this year on 20th january i chose four universities to receive my scores my score has been released but i’ve got no emails from those universities i wonder why the universities are in the us by the way reply magoosh test prep expert april 1 2016 at 922 pm i can see how you’d be anxious josh very often though if you don’t hear from a university it simply means that they don’t have a policy of contacting students when the scores come in still it couldn’t hurt to contact the admissions offices at your prospective universities and make sure your scores did arrive they should be able to check your application file and let you know reply josh march 1 2016 at 1243 am i wrote my toefl on 20th january 2016 the score was submitted on the 26th of last month but i’ve received no emails from the universities i chose during the registration please why is that happening reply david recine march 16 2016 at 1147 am josh to my understanding not all universities will send you email notification when they receive your scores i recommend calling the university admissions offices that you’ve applied to and checking to see if they’ve gotten your scores yet and if so what the status of your application is reply anoop hira march 11 2016 at 1043 am hi rachel what is the right age to take toefl test i mean this test is same for undergraduates and graduates courses students for undergraduates courses are fairly less mature and inexperienced and have lesser exposure so are questions level of difficulty different for each type of course is different or its same for all thanks anoop hira reply magoosh test prep expert march 30 2016 at 153 pm hi anoophappy to helpthe toefl is not a maturity or age sensitive test it tests very generally whether a person is able to handle the academic and linguistic environments of university in english many undergraduate programs will have slightly lower expectations compared to graduate programs–this reflects the level of english they expect applicants to need in order to succeed because a toefl score is only good for 2 years it is best to take it near to the time one needs to apply for a program this could mean taking the toefl more than once a student attending a 4year program for undergraduate and then a master’s after will likely need to take the toefl twice i hope that clarifiesreply korina t march 22 2016 at 700 pm hi i have a really important question i took the toefl exam last march 11 2016 and got the results online after a week i applied to 3 canadian universities and two of those universities need the results by april 1st when i registered for the test i did included those 3 universities as score recipients however i am not sure if my results are going to get in by april 1st are the results sent electronically or is it just through mail delivery if it is sent electronically how long would it take for the university to receive it thank you so much for your time and i would really appreciate if you could help me god blessreply magoosh test prep expert april 2 2016 at 342 am hi korinaaccording to ets “official score reports will be sent to your designated recipients approximately 13 days after you take the test however ets has no control over mail delivery to various locations around the world” now that april 1st has passed i’m sure this response is not very helpful so i hope that your scores made it in timereplysanchit march 31 2016 at 533 am hi if i qualify the toefl test and reach above the cutoff marks point the how will the schools i have applied for proceed further  alsoo i am not finding the free four institutions the toefl provides pleaze mention reply magoosh test prep expert april 4 2016 at 336 pm if you’ve gotten qualifying toefl scores and had them send tot he universities you’re applying for some universities will notify you that they’ve received your scores and are moving your application forward other universities may not notify you when this happens so be sure to check with your prospective universities to make sure they’ve gotten your scores and to find out what steps they take once they receive qualifying toefl scores from an applicant the toefl will allow you to send free score reports to any four universities of your choice if you’re having trouble finding that option in your toefl account contact ets customer service they’ll be able to walk you through the process and solve any technical problems you have accessing your options for sending scores reply mohammad safwan april 18 2016 at 1013 am helloi’ve to send my toefl scores to tu darmstadt but they haven’t got an institutional code could you please tell me about how to send it to the direct address it’s urgent thanks reply magoosh test prep expert april 18 2016 at 1130 am if you want to send your toefl scores to a university that’s not listed as a toefl site you’ll need to fill out your school’s information in the additional score report request form on the ets website although the form says “ additional score report” if you fill out this form and send it in to ets before your test day you can use the additional score report from to list where you’d like your four free score reports to be sent if one or more of the recipients is not on the list of official toefl destinations reply bhargavi dudharejiya april 22 2016 at 1109 pm hii i have taken test on 9th april scores are available but now i want to send my scores to universities and i can not find proper procedure under order score reports or additional score reports however i have not added universities before taking test please guide mereply magoosh test prep expert april 23 2016 at 1048 am hi bhargaviyou can send you score reports to universities when logged into your toefl account toefl account log in here are the instructions on how to send your score report from ets1 log in to your toefl i bt account 2 click “register for a testorder score reports” on your home page 3 pay by creditdebit card echeck or pay pal®you can send your score report to as many institutions as you choose for a fee of us19 per report i hope this helps reply tala april 28 2016 at 635 am hi okay so i can’t remember if i already chose to send the scores to my chosen college therefore the question for you guys is – if i want to check to who the scores were sent to if i already did how and where can i do that please let me know i dont want to be sending my scores again and having to pay again reply magoosh test prep expert april 30 2016 at 938 am this is a common but frustrating problem everything can feel like a blur when you’ve just finished the toefl because you’re both tired and relieved so it can be easy to forget to actually send scores— and easy to forget whether or not you sent out your scores fortunately there is a simple fix for your problem tala just use your ets toefl account to see if you actually sent out the scores– and to check the status of any send requests ets’s toefl account system is designed to be easy to use but if you have any doubts about what you see in your account and are still not sure if your scores were properly sent out you can always contact toefl customer service for extra assistance reply nishita may 2 2016 at 809 pm hi i have sent my toefl score reports electronically to the institute twice  and still they havent received it so can you please give me a solution for this reply magoosh test prep expert may 3 2016 at 928 pm sorry you’re having this frustrating problem nishita this is an uncommon problem but certainly not unheard of students in your situation should contact toefl customer service to try to figure out why no scores have arrived you might also want to double check exactly how your school is receiving them do they have a toefl code and does your electronic request need to be fulfilled by regular mail or has your school set itself up to receive scores completely by computer reply hylda damayanti may 25 2016 at 914 pm hi i want to ask for a suggestion i am planning to take a toefl test but since the admission date hasn’t been started yet i don’t have any account for any university but i want to use that 5 free list of university to send my score do you have any advice regarding that situation i am not familiar with the system but by the time the admission is started will they still get my result reply magoosh test prep expert may 27 2016 at 424 pm hylda– when you say “admission date” are you saying that the application deadlines for your universities haven’t been sent yet or are you saying you haven’t yet set a test date for your toefl either way you should be able to send score reports to your universities so long as you have an ets toefl account i hope i’ve understood your question correctly if that doesn’t quite answer your question tell me what else you need to know reply sachitanand ray june 1 2016 at 408 am hello my toefl exam is on june 25 and i would apply for january intake which is long after my exam can i send my score before i apply for the colleges i just want to use the free service please answer me reply magoosh test prep expert june 3 2016 at 1249 am hi sachitanandgood questionusually you can send the scores ahead of applications without trouble at the time you make your applications you should verify that the schools have access to your scores as you expected but typically this works just fine replysalim ali june 7 2016 at 1024 am hello i just recieved my results on my toefl account and want to the send them to a university but have not yet gotten my original certificate reply magoosh test prep expert june 13 2016 at 157 pm hi salimhappy to helpyou don’t physically mail your own scores–you pay ets to send them officially on your behalf you can read more about that here httpswwwetsorgtoeflibtscoressend so you don’t need your original score report document you can hop online and get those scores sent i hope that helpsreplyaastha june 16 2016 at 629 am hello i never selected any university before taking the test now i have my test score can i send my score to those four universities for free now reply magoosh test prep expert june 16 2016 at 1020 am hi aasthaunfortunately you have to pay to send your scores after the test day reply adeola june 18 2016 at 407 pm good day i took my toefl test on the 3rd of june 2016 but i realized at the exam center that there was a mistake with my date of birth  the examiner told me to contact toefl and let them know about the mistake and i did that the following monday  i sent a letter explaining the problem and sent my birth certificate and international passport and 7 days after my date of birth was corrected but it’s been 11 days after the exam today and i haven’t gotten my result and when i check the site the status of my score is not available please is there anything i can do to still get my score without retaking the exam or is retaking the exam the only option reply magoosh test prep expert june 20 2016 at 925 am hi adeolaunfortunately you will have to wait for ets to make a decision about how they want to proceed you should have the right to at least call them to find out the status of the case or worst case scenario whether they have or have not received your letter at all did you get confirmation that they received your initial communication in the first place you will get a decision either way–it will not leave you in limbo forever–so you will have to be patient which i know is not ideal good luckreply suzana june 22 2016 at 1257 pm hi i took toefl on december 2015 and i submitted my scores on paper on january 2016 to the university they haven’t received the scores yet and now they want me to send the scores only electronically but i don’t see this option on toefl’s website how can i send the scores electronically directly from toefl system i have to do this of the university can check my scores online thanks in advance reply magoosh test prep expert june 23 2016 at 138 am hi suzanayou need to contact ets to get this sorted out you should be able to send scores electronically through your ets login portal the same thing you used to register for the test but if you are having trouble ets can get it taken care of for you reply amir june 23 2016 at 1135 am hello i registered for the test but did not add any universities to send scores to at the time of registration now when i want to do that two days before the test i can not see the option to send the test scores for free all it shows me is sending additional test scores for which it is charging 19 help please reply magoosh test prep expert june 24 2016 at 1116 am hi amiryou do it in the testing center once your exam is finished so no need to worry nowreply adeeb june 29 2016 at 254 am hey my name in the university application for graduate study is  first name adeeb xyz last name pqr  but my toefl score report name is first name adeeb last namesurname xyzpqr will that matter in identifying and updating my ‘score recieved’ status reply magoosh test prep expert june 29 2016 at 827 pm this probably won’t affect things as universities are used to seeing the names of international students spelled displayed or ordered a little differently on different documents but to be on the safe side you may want to contact the university you applied to and let them know about the name difference in ets’s records and their files reply anungoo july 2 2016 at 1032 pm should i notify to universities that i’m sending my scores reply magoosh test prep expert july 3 2016 at 517 pm hi anungoono need to notify them this kind of thing happens all the time reply dipayan mitra july 2 2016 at 1158 pm hello is the score recipient section will it be wrong from my part if i select any department not listed i want to send score to all departments though my stream ee comes under physical science section till i want my score to be sent to all departments what should i do reply magoosh test prep expert july 3 2016 at 516 pm hi dipayantypically if a department has a special code you must send it to their special code if you want to send the score to multiple departments at a university you may be required to send it to multiple codes for that university for the ultimate final answer you should contact the school itself but in the past students have had to do what i describe above good luckreplydaniel july 8 2016 at 1208 am hello nice to see you replying for comments  i am already scheduled to take the exam on september 32016 but still i didn’t choose recipient universities  please tel me how i can choose and send and one more question can toefl help for masters program thank you so much reply magoosh test prep expert july 8 2016 at 355 pm hi danielyou can send your toefl scores at any time–the only difference is that after the test day itself you have to pay for that service otherwise though you can send scores equally so if you don’t know where to send scores yet hold off and do some proper research into what you want to do before making that important decisiontoefl scores can definitely be useful for masters programs–many schools in the us will require a toefl score and most universities around the world will require toefl or ielts as proof of english proficiency make sure the toefl will do what you want it to do for example ielts is more commonly accepted in the uk for example but it can be a good tool reply apurva singh july 19 2016 at 551 am hi i am apurva i will be taking my test toefl bit in august can i select my score recipients in july reply magoosh test prep expert july 19 2016 at 806 pm yes as soon as you schedule your exam you can go into your ets toefl account and select your score recipients reply natalie august 1 2016 at 208 am how to find out does the university accept mail score reports or electronical reports i apply to unsw in australia but i still cannot find out thank youreply magoosh test prep expert august 1 2016 at 458 pm to know if unsw– or any university— can get toefl scores electronically you will usually need to email or call the admissions office and ask reply vijay alfred august 6 2016 at 927 am hi does sending in toefl score reports mean that i don’t have to separately pay for applying to these 4 universities i am not quite sure what happens after the scores are viewed by the university reply magoosh test prep expert august 6 2016 at 1055 am you’ll still have to pay application fees to the four university recipients you choose to send toefl scores too but ets the company that makes the toefl won’t charge you any fee to send the scores to those for schools normally ets charges a scoresend fee of 27 per score report but these first score reports incur no charges from the toefl itself does that make sense reply jk august 10 2016 at 1235 am hi i have a question you said that “yes different score reports can definitely be sent separately and one score report won’t have nay information about previous toefl scores on it” in the above comment but in toefl faq they have this q will score recipients accept scores from previous tests a check with each score recipient directly doesn’t that “previous” mean “not most recent” or what could it be and some institution says “your most recent score must be” so if i take another test and i get a lower score wouldn’t it be a problem could you answer about this or any link to an official page that describes about this would be cool thanks reply magoosh test prep expert august 13 2016 at 141 pm all great questions jk yes “previous” refers to toefl score reports that are not the most recent most recipientsinstitutions will accept scores from toefl exams that aren’t the most recent but in rare cases it’s possible that a recipient may prefer to see only your most recent toefl score so ets advises that testtakers check with each institution they apply to there is no one official page for different school policies regarding this although you can check the admissions websites of various universities like i said though the “norm” is for universities to accept your highest unexpired toefl score even if the higher score is not the most recent one in fact i’ve never heard of a university demanding the most recent toefl score even if it’s not your best score reply amrita august 13 2016 at 142 pm hi i’m amrita i’m taking the toefl exam on 17th september 2016 i should be able to upload 4 score recipients for free till 16th september however the site is charging me 19 per report already and asking for my credit card information whenever i’m trying to update a recipient i have more than a month left before the exam i’m really worried about this can you provide any assistance regarding this issue reply magoosh test prep expert august 13 2016 at 356 pm if you’re getting charged for score reports that should be free this generally means you’re having a technical difficulty with your ets account and the toefl website if you contact toefl customer service they should be able to resolve this for you reply kartik august 15 2016 at 316 pm hiis it okay if i create my toefl ibt account with a different username other than my ets gre account i am not able able to create the account with the same credentials reply magoosh test prep expert august 16 2016 at 745 am hi kartikthat should be ok you will just have to login separately for each test instead of having them integrated in the ets system reply gabrielle august 18 2016 at 610 pm hello i’m late to send out my official toefl report on 11 august to ubc in canada and they are willing to wait for it however school will start after 2 weeks and i’m still waiting to finalize my admission offer as i’ve sent out all documents required i contacted ets by email on shipping dates on sending the report to ubc but they just answered it would take them 46 weeks to ship internationally i even sent an email to them that the report is urgent so should i contact them again or is there any solutions to my situation reply magoosh test prep expert august 22 2016 at 1129 am there’s no way to speed up the delivery of toefl scores by mail unfortunately but it may help to see if ubc is willing to receive your toefl scores directly from ets electronically toefl scores can be sent electronically by a service called ets data manager ubc would just need to be willing to set up an online account for the service this can be done very quickly and easily and it would also allow ubc to instantly accept gre and toefl scores over the web for all future applicants so you might be able to convince ubc to do this reply ana august 20 2016 at 1038 am helloi’m taking the test on september 2016 but i will apply to college in 2017 for graduate school will i be able to submit my scores then is it better to wait and take it when i know where i will apply thanks so muchreply magoosh test prep expert august 21 2016 at 1243 pm hi anayou can definitely take the test now the score is valid for 2 years so it will be only halfway through its lifetime additionally if you send the score this year and then it isn’t on file when you are applying you can easily send scores again for a small fee through your ets login reply ray august 21 2016 at 808 pm my name in the university application for graduate study is  first name a family name b  but my toefl score report name is first name b family name a does it affect my university application reply magoosh test prep expert august 22 2016 at 1102 am ideally this won’t create a problem in rare instances i’ve heard of universities flagging and questioning these kinds of name differences but even if that happens you should be able to straighten things out by talking to your school like i said though usually admissions offices don’t have a problem with this sort of thing replysimran september 7 2016 at 1230 am hello actually i didnot know about the four free orders for score receipient report i took my toefl test on september 3  now what are the steps to send my toefl score to the universities  i’m aware about the cost of 19 for each  reply magoosh test prep expert september 13 2016 at 1151 am hi simranthat’s right— after the examyou will unfortunately have to pay 19 for each score report beyond that the steps for sending the scores are very similar to sending the free scores before the test log in to your ets toefl account and send scores much as you would before test day… but with that fee reply manasi october 1 2016 at 652 am hii gave my toefl exam last year and did apply but didnt get an admit however i am applying for fall 17 again after i gave my gre my question is do i need to send the toefl scores again also my toefl account is linked to a different email id while my email address for the university is different for application will that be a problem how will the university know that this is my score report reply magoosh test prep expert october 1 2016 at 839 am sorry to hear you didn’t get in the first time but it’s great to see you get a second chance to apply some universities will be willing to look at your previous toefl score on file while others will want you to resend your toefl score if you make a new application contact the university you’re applying to and see if you need to resend if you do need to resend your toefl score the mismatched emails shouldn’t create a problem the university will still know it’s your toefl score because it will come directly from ets and the score report will verify your personal information and include your photo replychristina october 26 2016 at 902 am if i want to mail an additional score report to a university after i have already taken the test do i have to fill in the additional score report request form and fax it or mail it because i went to “order score reports” on the website and i don’t think it sends the score report by mail i think it sends it electronically reply magoosh test prep expert october 27 2016 at 741 pm you can request toefl scores electronically through the website– see the “order online” bullet point under the “sending your official score reports” heading on this page of the official toefl websit e the scores themselves will probably be sent to your university by mail unless you’ve applied to one of the few universities that receives toefl scores electronically reply bipin bhusal chhetri october 31 2016 at 1243 pm now my toefl and sat scores are out to submit my scores to the university i have listed in toefl and sat profile should i complete some other processing steps or they are automatically to send to those university reply magoosh test prep expert october 31 2016 at 211 pm congratulations on taking those tests and getting your scores the schools you preselected should automatically get scores from ets and the college board if you’re worried though you should be able to log in to your online toefl or sat accounts to see if the scores have been sent or call customer service to get confirmation that the scores were sent reply balachandra p november 1 2016 at 547 am hii have taken toefl exam on 28th oct but selected don’t send score option after the test now i am able to see in view scores as “cancelled” in ets site will i able to see my score in ets portal  regards balu reply magoosh test prep expert november 1 2016 at 1050 am hi balachara it sounds like you fully cancelled your toefl scores rather than just choosing not to send them if you want to view your scores again and possibly use them go to this page on the official toefl website and read the instructions under the heading “how to reinstate scores”reinstatement costs 20usd if you didn’t intend to completely cancel your scores i recommend contacting toefl customer service under certain circumstances they may be able to waive the score reinstatement fee replyimran november 13 2016 at 421 am i have registered for toefl exam at the time of registration i have not submiited the universities can i use four free universities option again reply magoosh test prep expert november 13 2016 at 542 pm you should still be able to do this so long as you haven’t actually taken your test yet you can log in to your ets toefl account and choose 4 recipient schools free of charge until 10pm the night before the exam reply okeke chinedu bruno november 14 2016 at 1114 am sir the agent who filled in my toefl ibt examination form which i sat on 6th of august 2016 mistakenly entered my date of birth as 20th may 1990 instead of 2nd may 1990 as correctly written in my international passport birth certificate and other relevant documents now the university i applied for can’t verify my toefl score online reply magoosh test prep expert november 15 2016 at 233 am hi okekeour comment policy is strict and our moderation takes a few days but no need to send multiple comments we got your messageas for this issue i’m sorry this happened to you unfortunately we have no way to help with this and you need to contact ets as soon as possible to get this straightened out good luckreply kondu november 22 2016 at 336 am i am a bit confused about the whole toefl system i selected the option to receive my test results online and per mail now can’t i just copy the result paper and send those copies around why would i pay 19 dollars just to send a university a score sheet anyway all those extra fees can add up really quickly if you don’t keep track all i wanted was to take a simple test but this feels more like a scam than a serious business reply magoosh test prep expert november 22 2016 at 846 pm all of those fees certainly can be frustrating universities generally don’t allow students to send copies of their results because there are concerns that some students might create false or altered copies of their scores there have even been cases of students sealing fake score results in fake envelopes and giving those supposedly sealed results to universities as a result universities want to see toefl scores sent to them directly from ets usually by mail and sometimes electronically at least you can send four score reports out for free it certainly would be nice if there weren’t fees for the additional schools of course replyakki january 11 2017 at 1253 pm hi my name is akas  i apply review of request 19 december but still waiting for result may i know how many week after i get my result because yesterday i got my score report is it old one right if my score change than they send me another one please reply me and if you any one have contact number ets send methanks reply magoosh test prep expert january 12 2017 at 744 am hi akkiaccording to ets you can expect your scores to be reported about 3 weeks after your request for your scores to be reviewed is received your original score report should have been available about 10 days after your exam or around december 29 with these two timelines in mind the score report available online as of yesterday should reflect your scores upon being reviewed to confirm this you may want to contact ets directly i hope this helps at least a little reply magoosh test prep expert january 12 2017 at 748 am hi akasif this is regarding a score review scores are reported online about 3 week after the request is received given your timeline this may very well be your rescore however i would consult the ets website for more information or if you’d rather contact them directly check out the link for toefl best of luckreply zeinab january 13 2017 at 533 am hi i have taken toefl i bt on january 7 i am applying for sweden and the defined deadline to submit my documents including official score report is february 1 in this way is it possible that my score is received from ets before mentioned deadline thanks reply magoosh test prep expert january 13 2017 at 932 am hi zeinabthe scores will be available online within 10 days approximately after your test date if they are mailed to sweden the paper copies are sent 13 days after your test date and the time it takes to arrive depends on international mail official word is up to 46 weeks which would be too late for your february 1 deadline unless the school is able to access the scores online you can ask to find out then the timeline is too short good luckreply anna january 26 2017 at 334 am is there any possibility for the test scores to arrive sooner than 4 weeks later or is 4 weeks the minimum – and if it is is it possible in any way to speed up the process i just find it disconcerting that a priority letter from the us to japan where the university i want to apply to is takes up to 10 business days to arrive but official scores take twice as long reply magoosh test prep expert january 26 2017 at 1144 am hi annayes there is a possibility for the test scores to arrive sooner than the 4 weeks that being said unfortunately based on ets’s website ets does not have much control over the delivery time however if you feel compelled to do so you can contact them directly here to discuss your situation best of luck annareply kunal january 29 2017 at 915 am hey i gave my toefl examination on 17 december and now i want to send my score to some university however i am unable to find that option anywhere on the website i click on view order and got to my score recipients but there is no way to modify the info so that i can add new university can you tell me the step by step process of how i should send my score after the exam cause i am unable to find that option anywhere anything else i do it is prompting me to register for another test regards kunal reply magoosh test prep expert january 29 2017 at 523 pm hi kunaii’m sorry that you are having a hard time sending those scores out i know that must be frustrating it sounds like you are already following the directions for sending score reports you can see the full directions here it sounds like there may be some sort of technical issue–i recommend that you contact ets directly and ask them for help with this they should be able to give you some help to send those scoresreply gent february 14 2017 at 318 am hii have not sent the scores before the test and did not choose any of the four universities for free since i did not know about this is it possible to send scores now for free after the results waiting for your answer reply magoosh test prep expert february 14 2017 at 819 am hi thereunfortunately you cannot send your scores for free up to 4 programs after the exam however after your test day you can submit score reports to your target programs for 19 each best of luck and congrats on completing the

to your registration page and add the universities there if you have any issues with this i encourage you to get in touch with ets httpswwwetsorgcontact reply ilsa august 25 2017 at 233 pm heyi have about 20 hours left to the 10pm deadline but if i add the institutions it charges me 20 each i think the problem is that the option only asks if i want to send ‘additional score reports’ implying that ive sent the four im following the procedure on the site but its not working please help thanks reply magoosh test prep expert august 25 2017 at 452 pm hi ilsai’m sorry to hear that you have having trouble with this unfortunately we at magoosh are completely separate from ets the fastest way to get an answer would be to contact ets directly and ask your question you can see their contact info here httpswwwetsorgcontact sorry i couldn’t be more helpful and best of luck with your test and with this technical issuereply dweep gogia september 21 2017 at 1142 pm hey i’m facing the same issue

magoosh test prep expert october 27 2017 at 1234 pm hi yoel–i’m not entirely sure i understand what you are asking about here ets would not allow you to send the scores off with insufficient information you also will not receive any information back from the universities–they will receive your scores and save them once you turn in your application the school will match your official toefl scores with your application you can keep track of your scores and schools through your ets toefl account or contact ets directly if you think that something went wrong good luckreply sachin shriwastav october 30 2017 at 151 am i took my test on oct 15 and added four free score recipients a day before the test how to see the list of recipients i added earlier reply magoosh test prep expert october 31 2017 at 1238 pm hi sachin you should be able to see this information by logging into your toefl i bt account reply vum november 29 2017 at 858 am hi i want to ask a question my test day is on dec16 and approximately 1 month ago i added the institutions to the “score recipient” but i checked it today i found that no any institutions showed below the “score recipient” so i modified again it didn’t have any problem and showed on the page but if i refreshed it it disappeared again is it normal or i should wait to see the list after ets sends the score to institutions thanks if i send twice messages i am sorry about thatreply magoosh test prep expert november 30 2017 at 304 pm hi vumyou should contact ets to verify this because you don’t want to lose the free score report feature they can help you figure out what’s going on and if you need to worry before test day or whether you can simply enter the codes that day replymkst december 6 2017 at 351 am hi i decided to postpone my applications for grad school for the next year and my toefl exam is in three days – so it is too late to cancel or reschedule it now my question is – will the universities that i designated as the recipients of my scores still have my scores next year when i submit the rest of my application reply magoosh test prep expert december 6 2017 at 911 am hi mkstthey should have access to your electronic scores for the duration of their validity 2 years but you can always verify this next year when applying the worst case scenario would be that you have to resend the scores next year but that would not be a big deal reply shabnam december 16 2017 at 453 am hi therehow areyou doing i took my toefl and gre tests in october i could not decide on the universities till today so i want to send my scores now but the deadline in most of the universities is first week of jan i guess i’m going to struggle with the delivery of all the documents on time how long does it take for the toefl and gre score to reach the university after i send it reply magoosh test prep expert december 16 2017 at 1030 am hi shabnamhappy to help are you applying for universities within the us if so then the toefl tests should take around 710 business to reach their destination so they should be there on time if you are sending them to schools outside of the us it might take longer and i recommend that you contact your schools to explain the situation it doesn’t matter if you took the toefl outside of the us–the scores will be mailed from within the us i recommend that you read this blog post for more info on sending gre scores schools decide how they receive score reports and this determines how long it takes if your schools accept the gre electronically then they will receive the scores automatically if they receive the score via mail it will take a bit longer 1015 business days but it you send it now then they should still reach the schools by the first week of january in any case–don’t delay send the scores as soon as possible–i think you’ll be fine reply k january 7 2018 at 733 pm hi i plan to retake the toefl test again on march 3 sdsu’s deadline is on april1 if i choose to send the score electronically after knowing the result will the mail get there in time or should i choose to send score to the recipients before taking the test so it can save more time one more question i took the test and got 93 and the department requires 90 i want to apply for the graduate program in applied linguistics is my score too low what should be a good score range for applying to this university thank youreply magoosh test prep expert january 8 2018 at 1232 pm hi therethe toefl scores aren’t sent out to universities until after the scores are released so you can expect that scores will reach american universities around 23 days after taking the test the scores will reach the university approximately 10 days after you receive your official score report so if you take the test on march 3 then you can expect your results around march 16 you should have plenty of time to decide whether to send your score report after the official scores are released as long as you designate the universities within a few days of receiving the scores you should send the score report no later than march 19th or 20th to be sure that they will arrive on time our expertise is in test prep not admissions advice so i’m afraid i can’t provide you with a perfect answer to your question about admission to sdsu all i can see is what they post on their website which is that their minimum score is a 93 each school has slightly different ways of using toefl scores–some universities only care that you reach a minimum score other universities like to see higher scores i recommend that you directly contact some of the admissions counselors and coordinators for the graduate program to see if they have any insight they can share with you in general however a higher toefl score can only be a good thing reply spandana c january 9 2018 at 846 am hey i have a question you mentioned scores being sent by mail what about additional score reports they would be sent electronically to the university right so would they be sent faster reply spandana c january 9 2018 at 850 am also to add to that the toefl website says the request to sent scores is processed in 35 days so does that mean my scores would be available to the university in 35 days reply magoosh test prep expert january 10 2018 at 734 am hi again spandana can you please send the link to the page where you saw this information thanksreply magoosh test prep expert january 10 2018 at 732 am hi spandanai think this blog post will answer many of your questions httpsmagooshcomtoefl2016cantoeflscoresbesentelectronicallythe method for sending scores is determined by the school not by when you send them some schools pay ets to get electronic scores so that they can see your scores as soon as they are available other schools only accept toefl scores by mail additional score reports will be sent to the schools in the same way that free scores are sent the school determines how the scores will be sent–whether electrically or via mail–and unfortunately you don’t have any control over this in any case you should plan to take the toefl with enough time for the scores to arrive via mail replyalzihbah january 24 2018 at 1039 pm can anyone answer me please how to i send my itp toefl score to universities they give me just 1 copy of score paper reply magoosh test prep expert january 26 2018 at 242 pm hi alzihbahyou have to send scores through your ets account schools require you to send official score reports through ets so that they can verify that it’s yours the score report that you were given can work as an unofficial score but you will need to send the reports through ets for 19 each reply angel january 26 2018 at 315 am hello i will take toefl in february and i want the scores to be sent to the universities by november will they still be valied or it will need me to take another test afterwards reply magoosh test prep expert january 26 2018 at 247 pm hi angeltoefl scores are valid for 2 years after the test date so it’s perfectly fine to take the toefl in february and apply in november if you take the test in february 2018 they are good until february 2020 reply sonu january 28 2018 at 625 pm my toefl ibt score already declared on my toefl id even score pdf also generated but when i checked after 8 days of the result in my id it was showing score not available how its possible reply magoosh test prep expert january 29 2018 at 1058 am hi sonui suggest that you contact ets directly we’ve been hearing a few reports of students whose scores have not shown up online unfortunately we don’t have any more information about this than you do but ets should be able to answer your questions good luck reply jhon february 10 2018 at 451 am is the toefl official scorecard couriered to me and those couriered directly to institutions are these same can i order scorecard at my home and then send it to the universities rather than directly sending it to universities do they accept it reply david recine february 10 2018 at 942 am you can choose to have the official score report sent directly to you sent directly to the universities or both most universities will want to see the scores sent directly to them in some rare cases a university will be ok with seeing a toefl score that was first sent to you to see if one of your target schools would accept such a score report check directly with the school but like i said be prepared to get a report sent directly to them replynawraj march 14 2018 at 349 am i selected four institutions to report my score but i selected wrong department can i change it now i have already received the score reply magoosh test prep expert march 14 2018 at 1023 am hi therei recommend that you contact the schools and ets directly to see what your options are some schools may be able to retrieve your scores from their system while others may not you may have to resend the scores to some if not all of the schools good luckreply magoosh blog comment policy to create the best experience for our readers we will only approve comments that are relevant to the
