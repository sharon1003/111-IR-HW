from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search a penrose tiling a penrose tiling is an example of nonperiodic tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist sir roger penrose who investigated these sets in the 1970s the aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original a penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry as in the diagram at the right penrose tiling is nonperiodic which means that it lacks any translational symmetry it is selfsimilar so the same patterns occur at larger and larger scales thus the tiling can be obtained through inflation or deflation and every finite patch from the tiling occurs infinitely many times it is a quasicrystal implemented as a physical structure a penrose tiling will produce bragg diffraction and its diffractogram reveals both the fivefold symmetry and the underlying long range order various methods to construct penrose tilings have been discovered including matching rules substitutions or subdivision rules cut and project schemes and coverings roger

external links background and history  editperiodic and aperiodic tilings  editfigure 1 part of a periodic tiling penrose tilings are simple examples of aperiodic tilings of the plane 1 a tiling is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps the tiles normally have a finite number of shapes called prototiles and a set of prototiles is said to admit a tiling or tile the plane if there is a tiling of the plane using only tiles congruent to these prototiles 2 the most familiar tilings eg by squares or triangles are periodic a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by translating all of the tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction such a translation is called a period of the tiling more informally this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals if a tiling has no periods it is said to be nonperiodic a set of prototiles is said to be aperiodic if it tiles the plane but every such tiling is nonperiodic tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings 3earliest aperiodic tilings  editan aperiodic set of wang dominoes 4the subject of aperiodic tilings received new interest in the 1960s when logician hao wang noted connections between decision problems and tilings 5 in particular he introduced tilings by square plates with colored edges now known as wang dominoes or tiles and posed the  domino problem  to determine whether a given set of wang dominoes could tile the plane with matching colors on adjacent domino edges he observed that if this problem were undecidable then there would have to exist an aperiodic set of wang dominoes at the time this seemed implausible so wang conjectured no such set could exist robinsons six prototiles wangs student robert berger proved that the domino problem was undecidable so wangs conjecture was incorrect in his 1964 thesis 6 and obtained an aperiodic set of 20426 wang dominoes 7 he also described a reduction to 104 such prototiles the latter did not appear in his published monograph 8 but in 1968 donald knuth detailed a modification of bergers set requiring only 92 dominoes 9the color matching required in a tiling by wang dominoes can easily be achieved by modifying the edges of the tiles like jigsaw puzzle pieces so that they can fit together only as prescribed by the edge colorings 10 raphael robinson in a 1971 paper 11 which simplified bergers techniques and undecidability proof used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles 12development of the penrose tilings  editfigure 2 the pentagonal penrose tiling p1 drawn in black on a colored rhombus tiling p3 with yellow edges 13the first penrose tiling tiling p1 below is an aperiodic set of six prototiles introduced by roger penrose in a 1974 paper 14 but it is based on pentagons rather than squares any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps but johannes kepler showed in his 1619 work harmonices mundi that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams  star polygons  decagons and related shapes 15 traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of albrecht dürer 16 acknowledging inspiration from kepler penrose found matching rules which can be imposed by decorations of the edges for these shapes obtaining an aperiodic set his tiling can be viewed as a completion of keplers finite aa pattern 17penrose subsequently reduced the number of prototiles to two discovering the kite and dart tiling tiling p2 below and the rhombus tiling tiling p3 below 18 the rhombus tiling was independently discovered by robert ammann in 1976 19 penrose and john h conway investigated the properties of penrose tilings and discovered that a substitution property explained their hierarchical nature their findings were publicized by martin gardner in his january 1977  mathematical games column  in scientific american 20in 1981 de bruijn explained a method to construct penrose tilings 21 from five families of parallel lines as well as a cut and project method in which penrose tilings are obtained as twodimensional projections from a fivedimensional cubic structure in this approach the penrose tiling is viewed as a set of points its vertices while the tiles are geometrical shapes obtained by connecting vertices with edges the penrose tilings  edita p1 tiling using penroses original set of six prototiles the three types of penrose tiling p1–p3 are described individually below 22 they have many common features in each case the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon and hence to the golden ratio  but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by matching rules in order to tile aperiodically these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges or patterns on the tile faces – alternatively the edge profile can be modified eg by indentations and protrusions to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles 7 23the original pentagonal penrose tiling p1  editpenroses first tiling uses pentagons and three other shapes a fivepointed star a pentagram a boat roughly 35 of a star and a diamond a thin rhombus 24 to ensure that all tilings are nonperiodic there are matching rules that specify how tiles may meet each other and there are three different types of matching rule for the pentagonal tiles it is common to indicate the three different types of pentagonal tiles using three different colors as in the figure above right 25kite and dart tiling p2  editwallpaper created by applying several deflations to a penrose tiling of type p2 kite and dart penroses second tiling uses quadrilaterals called the kite and dart which may be combined to make a rhombus however the matching rules prohibit such a combination 26 both the kite and dart are composed of two triangles called robinson triangles after 1975 notes by robinson 27kite and dart tiles top and the seven possible vertex figures in a p2 tiling the kite is a quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 72 72 72 and 144 degrees the kite may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of acute robinson triangles with angles of 36 72 and 72 degrees the dart is a nonconvex quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 36 72 36 and 216 degrees the dart may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of obtuse robinson triangles with angles of 36 36 and 108 degrees which are smaller than the acute triangles the matching rules can be described in several ways one approach is to color the vertices with two colors eg black and white and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices 28 another is to use a pattern of circular arcs as shown above left in green and red to constrain the placement of tiles when two tiles share an edge in a tiling the patterns must match at these edges 18these rules often force the placement of certain tiles for example the concave vertex of any dart is necessarily filled by two kites the corresponding figure center of the top row in the lower image on the left is called an ace by conway although it looks like an enlarged kite it does not tile in the same way 29 similarly the concave vertex formed when two kites meet along a short edge is necessarily filled by two darts bottom right in fact there are only seven possible ways for the tiles to meet at a vertex two of these figures – namely the star top left and the sun top right – have 5fold dihedral symmetry by rotations and reflections while the remainder have a single axis of reflection vertical in the image 30 apart from the ace and the sun all of these vertex figures force the placement of additional tiles 31rhombus tiling p3  editmatching rule for penrose rhombs using circular arcs or edge modifications the third tiling uses a pair of rhombuses often referred to as  rhombs  in this context with equal sides but different angles 7 ordinary rhombusshaped tiles can be used to tile the plane periodically so restrictions must be made on how tiles can be assembled no two tiles may form a parallelogram as this would allow a periodic tiling but this constraint is not sufficient to force aperiodicity as figure 1 above shows there are two kinds of tile both of which can be decomposed into robinson triangles 27the thin rhomb t has four corners with angles of 36 144 36 and 144 degrees the t rhomb may be bisected along its short diagonal to form a pair of acute robinson triangles the thick rhomb t has angles of 72 108 72 and 108 degrees the t rhomb may be bisected along its long diagonal to form a pair of obtuse robinson triangles in contrast to the p2 tiling these are larger than the acute triangles the matching rules distinguish sides of the tiles and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others two ways to describe these matching rules are shown in the image on the right in one form tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge in the other tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together 7there are 54 cyclically ordered combinations of such angles that add up to 360 degrees at a vertex but the rules of the tiling allow only seven of these combinations to appear although one of these arises in two ways 32the various combinations of angles and facial curvature allow construction of arbitrarily complex tiles such as the penrose chickens features and constructions  editthe golden ratio and local pentagonal symmetry  editseveral properties and common features of the penrose tilings involve the golden ratio φ  1 √ 5 2 approximately 1618 27 28 this is the ratio of chord lengths to side lengths in a regular pentagon and satisfies φ  1  1 φ pentagon with an inscribed thick rhomb light acute robinson triangles lightly shaded and a small obtuse robinson triangle darker dotted lines give additional edges for inscribed kites and darts consequently the ratio of the lengths of long sides to short sides in the  isosceles robinson triangles is φ 1 it follows that the ratio of long side lengths to short in both kite and dart tiles is also φ 1 as are the length ratios of sides to the short diagonal in the thin rhomb t and of long diagonal to sides in the thick rhomb t in both the p2 and p3 tilings the ratio of the area of the larger robinson triangle to the smaller one is φ 1 hence so are the ratios of the areas of the kite to the dart and of the thick rhomb to the thin rhomb both larger and smaller obtuse robinson triangles can be found in the pentagon on the left the larger triangles at the top – the halves of the thick rhomb – have linear dimensions scaled up by φ compared to the small shaded triangle at the base and so the ratio of areas is φ 2 1 any penrose tiling has local pentagonal symmetry in the sense that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point a dihedral symmetry group 7 this symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point but the patch can be very large conway and penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the p2 or p3 tilings close in a loop the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry and furthermore in any tiling there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up 33there can be at most one center point of global fivefold symmetry if there were more than one then rotating each about the other would yield two closer centers of fivefold symmetry which leads to a mathematical contradiction 34 there are only two penrose tilings of each type with global pentagonal symmetry for the p2 tiling by kites and darts the center point is either a sun or star vertex 35inflation and deflation  edita pentagon decomposed into six smaller pentagons half a dodecahedral net with gaps many of the common features of penrose tilings follow from a hierarchical pentagonal structure given by substitution rules this is often referred to as inflation and deflation or composition and decomposition of tilings or collections of tiles 7 20 36 the substitution rules decompose each tile into smaller tiles of the same shape as those used in the tiling and thus allow larger tiles to be composed from smaller ones this shows that the penrose tiling has a scaling selfsimilarity and so can be thought of as a fractal 37penrose originally discovered the p1 tiling in this way by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons one half of a net of a dodecahedron and five halfdiamonds he then observed that when he repeated this process the gaps between pentagons could all be filled by stars diamonds boats and other pentagons 24 by iterating this process indefinitely he obtained one of the two p1 tilings with pentagonal symmetry 7 17robinson triangle decompositions  editrobinson triangles and their decompositions the substitution method for both p2 and p3 tilings can be described using robinson triangles of different sizes the robinson triangles arising in p2 tilings by bisecting kites and darts are called atiles while those arising in the p3 tilings by bisecting rhombs are called btiles 27 the smaller atile denoted a s is an obtuse robinson triangle while the larger atile a l is acute in contrast a smaller btile denoted b s is an acute robinson triangle while the larger btile b l is obtuse concretely if a s has side lengths 1 1 φ  then a l has side lengths  φ φ 1 btiles can be related to such atiles in two ways if b s has the same size as a l then b l is an enlarged version φ a s of a s with side lengths  φ φ φ 2  1  φ – this decomposes into an a l tile and a s tile joined along a common side of length 1 if instead b l is identified with a s then b s is a reduced version 1 φ a l of a l with side lengths 1 φ 1 φ 1 – joining a b s tile and a b l tile along a common side of length 1 then yields a decomposition of an a l tile in these decompositions there appears to be an ambiguity robinson triangles may be decomposed in two ways which are mirror images of each other in the isosceles axis of symmetry of the triangle in a penrose tiling this choice is fixed by the matching rules – furthermore the matching rules also determine how the smaller triangles in the tiling compose to give larger ones 27partial inflation of star to yield rhombs and of a collection of rhombs to yield an ace it follows that the p2 and p3 tilings are mutually locally derivable a tiling by one set of tiles can be used to generate a tiling by another – for example a tiling by kites and darts may be subdivided into atiles and these can be composed in a canonical way to form btiles and hence rhombs 13 the p2 and p3 tilings are also both mutually locally derivable with the p1 tiling see figure 2 above  38the decomposition of btiles into atiles may be written b s  a l b l  a l  a s assuming the larger size convention for the btiles which can be summarized in a substitution matrix equation 39  1 11 0 combining this with the decomposition of enlarged φ atiles into btiles yields the substitution φφ 1 11 0  2 11 1 so that the enlarged tile φ a l decomposes into two a l tiles and one a s tiles the matching rules force a particular substitution the two a l tiles in a φ a l tile must form a kite – thus a kite decomposes into two kites and a two halfdarts and a dart decomposes into a kite and two halfdarts 40 41 enlarged φ btiles decompose into btiles in a similar way via φ atiles composition and decomposition can be iterated so that for example  2 11 1 the number of kites and darts in the n th iteration of the construction is determined by the n th power of the substitution matrix 2 11 1 where f n is the n th fibonacci number the ratio of numbers of kites to darts in any sufficiently large p2 penrose tiling pattern therefore approximates to the golden ratio φ 42 a similar result holds for the ratio of the number of thick rhombs to thin rhombs in the p3 penrose tiling 40deflation for p2 and p3 tilings  editconsecutive deflations of the sun vertex in a penrose tiling of type p2consecutive deflations of a tileset in a penrose tiling of type p2 filling a 169 wide rectangle8th deflation of the sun vertex in a penrose tiling of type p2starting with a collection of tiles from a given tiling which might be a single tile a tiling of the plane or any other collection deflation proceeds with a sequence of steps called generations in one generation of deflation each tile is replaced with two or more new tiles that are scaleddown versions of tiles used in the original tiling the substitution rules guarantee that the new tiles will be arranged in accordance with the matching rules 40 repeated generations of deflation produce a tiling of the original axiom shape with smaller and smaller tiles this rule for dividing the tiles is a subdivision rule name initial tiles generation 1 generation 2 generation 3halfkite halfdart sun star consequences and applications  editinflation and deflation yield a method for constructing kite and dart p2 tilings or rhombus p3 tilings known as updown generation 29 40 41the penrose tilings being nonperiodic have no translational symmetry – the pattern cannot be shifted to match itself over the entire plane however any bounded region no matter how large will be repeated an infinite number of times within the tiling therefore a finite patch cannot differentiate between the uncountably many penrose tilings nor even determine which position within the tiling is being shown 43this shows in particular that the number of distinct penrose tilings of any type is uncountably infinite updown generation yields one method to parameterize the tilings but other methods use ammann bars pentagrids or cut and project schemes 40related tilings and topics  editdecagonal coverings and quasicrystals  editgummelts decagon left with the decomposition into kites and darts indicated by dashed lines the thicker darker lines bound an inscribed ace and thick rhomb possible overlaps right are by one or two red aces 44in 1996 german mathematician petra gummelt demonstrated that a covering so called to distinguish it from a nonoverlapping tiling equivalent to the penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed 45 the decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring a suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a penrose p2 tiling similarly a p3 tiling can be obtained by inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs these coverings have been considered as a realistic model for the growth of quasicrystals the overlapping decagons are quasiunit cells analogous to the unit cells from which crystals are constructed and the matching rules maximize the density of certain atomic clusters 44 46related tilings  edittie and navette tiling in red on a penrose backgroundthe three variants of the penrose tiling are mutually locally derivable selecting some subsets from the vertices of a p1 tiling allows to produce other nonperiodic tilings if the corners of one pentagon in p1 are labeled in succession by 13524 an unambiguous tagging in all the pentagons is established the order being either clockwise or counterclockwise points with the same label define a tiling by robinson triangles while points with the numbers 3 and 4 on them define the vertices of a tieandnavette tiling 47there are also other related unequivalent tilings such as the hexagonboatstar and mikulla–roth tilings for instance if the matching rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex a binary tiling is obtained 48 its underlying symmetry is also fivefold but it is not a quasicrystal it can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones or by applying substitution rules but not by de bruijns cutandproject method 49a variant tiling which is not a quasicrystal it is not a penrose tiling because it does not comply with the tile alignment rules penrose tilings and art  editthe aesthetic value of tilings has long been appreciated and remains a source of interest in them here the visual appearance rather than the formal defining properties of penrose tilings has attracted attention the similarity with some decorative patterns used in the middle east has been noted 50 51 the physicists peter j lu and paul steinhardt have presented evidence that a penrose tiling underlies some examples of medieval islamic geometric patterns such as the girih strapwork tilings at the darbe imam shrine in isfahan 52drop city artist clark richert used penrose rhombs in artwork in 1970  derived by projecting the rhombic triacontahedron shadow onto a plane observing the embedded fat rhombi and skinny rhombi which tile together to produce the nonperiodic tessellation art historian martin kemp has observed that albrecht dürer sketched similar motifs of a rhombus tiling 53san franciscos new 42 billion transbay transit center is planned to have perforations in its exteriors undulating white metal skin in the penrose
