by dean e falk extension dairy specialist university of idaho dairy cows and milking facilities require a reliable high quality water supply dairy production is changing with larger production units being planned and constructed these dairy facilities require a water supply that can deliver high quality water to the cows at all times in sufficient amounts to meet both physiological and sanitation needs of the facility the data reported in the literature for water consumption for dairy facilities varies considerably for example in three different studies the water needs for lactating cow consumption and milking center cleaning range between 40 to 50 gallons fresh water per cow per day in these studies the free stall units were flushed with recycled lagoon water in all areas except the milk parlor and milk room this concept reduces the amount of water that is introduced into the waste management system texas data illustrates that water use on eleven dairy farms varied widely depending on the type of manure removal system and other factors the greatest variable was the use of sprinkler cow wash systems andor flush systems versus manual manure removal the total amount of fresh water used for sanitation and manure removal averaged 396 gallons per cow per day the mean value for each farm ranged from 123 to 692 gallons per cow per day the water used for cattle drinking water troughs on seven of the dairies studied averaged 287±120 gallons per cow per day thus the texas data average fresh water use per cow per day for sanitation and drinking was 683 gallons their data showed wide differences in water use for facilities that flushed or had cow sprinklers versus those that used manual cleanup the average water use for milking parlors and holding pens without flush or cow sprinklers averaged 199±140 gallons per cow per day in contrast milking parlors and holding pens with sprinkler cow washers used an average of 471±177 gallons per cow per day calculating herd requirements for fresh water it is possible to estimate fresh water use on individual dairies even with the wide variation reported in the literature estimates for total requirements can be developed for drinking water wash pen sprinklers if used and milk house and parlor water needs can be estimated by completing worksheet 1  requires adobe acrobat with information found in tables 14 drinking water needs drinking water needs can be determined by using the information found in table 1 and table 2 table 1 shows a typical herd makeup assuming a uniform year around calving 13 month

provides a good estimate of water intake based upon size milk production and temperature the data from the water intake table when matched with the herd makeup table will estimate herd drinking water

typical dairies the amount used is dependent on line pressure sprinkler orifice number of sprinklers and minutes per day used table 3 shows the gallons per minute per sprinkler with different line pressure in pounds per square inch the number of sprinklers in the wash pen the minutes used per day and the nozzle discharge will determine water used in the wash pen table 3 nozzle discharge gpm18
