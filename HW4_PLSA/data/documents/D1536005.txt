are too many benefits for the rangers and the city of arlington rangers owner ray davis who started coming to games as a fan sitting in the bleachers at arlington stadium said a retractableroof stadium was a must for the future of the franchise the rangers expect a significant increase in their revenues with the new facility its personal when i think where our fan base comes from davis said we service five states it is our responsibility as owners to make sure our fans have the best fan experience for years to come we owe it to our fan base in north texas and five states to give them a fanfriendly safe comfortable environment to have a higherthanaverage attendance  especially during the dog days of summer  allows us to raise revenue and spend more money on players and free agents the future of globe life park is still unknown but most of it will be torn down and converted to other uses including parking spaces some parts may be preserved opened in 1994 as the ballpark in arlington globe life park was acclaimed as an architectural jewel and has served the rangers well for 22 years the construction of the ballpark overseen masterfully by former club president tom schieffer was a turning point in the rangers becoming a firstclass major league franchise but without climate control and a retractable roof the ballparks days were numbered the current ownership headed by davis and bob simpson which bought the team at auction in 2010 wanted a new retractableroof ballpark almost from the beginning it was our dream davis said rendering of new ballpark with roof closed texas rangersthe rangers looked into the possibility of a retractable roof at globe life park but they found it unpractical or too expensive its difficult to add new technology to an old facility davis said the construction of a new facility with a retractable roof and so many other amenities would allow us to enhance that experience in a manner that is not presently possible the city of arlington was concerned that dallas would try to lure the rangers away and davis said arlington was proactive in getting a deal done and the rangers were too because they were bound to their lease through 2023 this allows them to move into a new stadium at least three years earlier possible than with another city that was very compelling davis said the rangers have had a long and very successful partnership with the city of arlington added williams we didnt want to lose the rangers this was our time this was something that was hanging over us and we wanted taken care of it we wanted to assure we had the texas rangers its a source of community pride the rangers have just begun the design process but the new ballpark will likely seat 4200044000 fans and have natural grass davis said the club will look to the classic look of globe life park for inspiration but will also visit every other ballpark in the majors to gather ideas i love brick â€¦ i love the classic look davis said put a roof on it and im happy the rangers portion of the financing will come through users fees which could include a tax on admission tickets a parking tax and revenue from the sale of individual stadium builder licenses that enable the holder to buy tickets for certain seats in the new ballpark among those attending the press conference were family members of the late tom vandergriff the former arlington mayor who was responsible for bringing the washington senators to texas in 1971 also there was former arlington mayor richard greene who worked handinhand with schieffer in the financing and construction of the ballpark in arlington there is only one thing that could make me cry more than the tearing down of the ballpark in arlington and thats losing the rangers to dallas greene said t r sullivan has covered the rangers since 1989 and for mlbcom since 2006 follow him on twitter sullivanranger and listen to his podcast read more texas rangers view 0
