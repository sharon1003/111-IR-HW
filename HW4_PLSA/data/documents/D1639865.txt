statements for this softchalk lesson1 aerobic respiration involves four stages glycolysis a transition reaction that forms acetyl coenzyme a the citric acid krebs cycle and an electron transport chain and chemiosmosis 2 during various steps in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle the oxidation of certain intermediate precursor molecules causes the reduction of nad  to nadh  h  and fad to fadh 2 nadh and fadh 2 then transfer protons and electrons to the electron transport chain to produce additional atps by oxidative phosphorylation 3 the electron transport chain consists of a series of electron carriers that eventually transfer electrons from nadh and fadh 2 to oxygen 4 the chemiosmotic theory states that the tranfer of electrons down an electron transport system through a series of oxidationreduction reactions releases energy this energy allows certain carriers in the chain to transport hydrogen ions h  or protons across a membrane 5 as the hydrogen ions accumulate on one side of a membrane the concentration of hydrogen ions creates an electrochemical gradient or potential difference voltage across the membrane called proton motive force 6 this proton motive force provides the energy necessary for enzymes called atp synthases also located in the membranes mentioned above to catalyze the synthesis of atp from adp and phosphate 7 during aerobic respiration the last electron carrier in the membrane transfers 2 electrons to half an oxygen molecule an oxygen atom that simultaneously combines with 2 protons from the surrounding medium to produce water as an end

of nutrients to carbon dioxide water and energy and involves an electron transport system in which molecular oxygen is the final electron acceptor most eukaryotes and prokaryotes use aerobic respiration to obtain energy from glucose the overall reaction is c 6h 12o 6 6o 2yields 6co 2 6h 2o  energy as atpnote that glucose c 6 h 12 o 6  is oxidized to produce carbon dioxide co 2 and oxygen o 2 is reduced to produce water h 2 o aerobic respiration involves four stages glycolysis a transition reaction that forms acetyl coenzyme a the citric acid krebs cycle and an electron transport chain and chemiosmosis in this section we will look at the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis the electron transport system during various steps in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle the oxidation of certain intermediate precursor molecules causes the reduction of nad  to nadh  h  and fad to fadh 2 nadh and fadh2 then transfer protons and electrons to the electron transport chain to produce additional atps by oxidative phosphorylation as mentioned in the previous section on energy during the process of aerobic respiration coupled oxidationreduction reactions and electron carriers are often part of what is called an electron transport chain a series of electron carriers that eventually transfers electrons from nadh and fadh 2 to oxygen the diffusible electron carriers nadh and fadh 2 carry hydrogen atoms protons and electrons from substrates in exergonic catabolic pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to other electron carriers that are embedded in membranes these membraneassociated electron carriers include flavoproteins ironsulfur proteins quinones and cytochromes the last electron carrier in the electron transport chain transfers the electrons to the teminal electron acceptor oxygen the chemiosmotic theory explains the functioning of electron transport chains according to this theory the tranfer of electrons down an electron transport system through a series of oxidationreduction reactions releases energy see fig 1 this energy allows certain carriers in the chain to transport hydrogen ions h  or protons across a membrane fig 1 energy

release during oxidationreduction reactions in an electron transport system electrons pass from carrier to carrier through a series of oxidationreduction reactions during each transfer some energy is released depending on the type of cell the electron transport chain may be found in the cytoplasmic membrane or the inner membrane of mitochondria in prokaryotic cells the protons are transported from the cytoplasm of the bacterium across the cytoplasmic membrane to the periplasmic space located between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cell wall  in eukaryotic cells protons are transported from the matrix of the mitochondria across the inner mitochondrial membrane to the intermembrane space located between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes as the hydrogen ions accumulate on one side of a membrane the concentration of hydrogen ions creates an electrochemical gradient or potential difference voltage across the membrane the fluid on the side of the membrane where the protons accumulate acquires a positive charge the fluid on the opposite side of the membrane is left with a negative charge the energized state of the membrane as a result of this charge separation is called proton motive force or pmf this proton motive force provides the energy necessary for enzymes called atp synthases see fig 2 also located in the membranes mentioned above to catalyze the synthesis of atp from adp and phosphate this generation of atp occurs as the protons cross the membrane through the atp synthase complexes and reenter either the bacterial cytoplasm see fig 3 or the matrix of the mitochondria as the protons move down the concentration gradient through the atp synthase the energy released causes the rotor and rod of the atp synthase to rotate the mechanical energy from this rotation is converted into chemical energy as phosphate is added to adp tform atp fig 2 atp synthase generating atpcopyright © gary e kaiser the chemiosmotic theory explains the functioning of
