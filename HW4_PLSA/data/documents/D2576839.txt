between a part of the central nervous system and some other body region see appendix26 and see color plates depending on their function nerves are known as sensory motor or mixed sensory nervessometimes called afferent nerves carry information from the outside world such as sensations of heat cold and pain to the brain and spinal cord motor nerves or efferent nerves transmitimpulses from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles mixed nerves are composed of both motorand sensory fibers and transmit messages in both directions at once together the nerves make up the peripheral nervous system as distinguished from the centralnervous system brain and spinal cord there are 12 pairs of cranial nerves which carry messages to and from the brain spinal nerves arise from the spinal
