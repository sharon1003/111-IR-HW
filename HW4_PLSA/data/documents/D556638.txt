s iouxby d l birchfield overview the siouanlanguage peoples comprise one of the largest language groups north of mexico second only to the algonquian family of languages many siouanlanguage peoples are no longer identified as sioux but have evolved their own separate tribal identities centuries ago long before contact with nonindians the name sioux originates from a french version of the chippewa nadouessioux snakes the immense geographical spread of siouanlanguage peoples from the rocky mountains to the atlantic ocean from the great lakes to the gulf of mexico attests to their importance in the history of the north american continent — most of that history having occurred before the arrival of nonindians those known today as sioux the dakota the lakota and the nakota living primarily in the upper great plains region are among the bestknown indians within american popular culture due to their participation in what americans perceive to have been dramatic events within their own history such as the battle of the little big horn in the late nineteenth century american students have been told for more than a century that there were no survivors despite the fact that approximately 2500 indian participants survived the battle the lands of the sioux have also been a focal point for some of the most dramatic events in the american indian movement of recent times especially the 71day occupation of wounded knee south dakota in 1973 which brought national media attention to the pine ridge reservation sioux writers poets and political leaders are today among the most influential leaders in the north american native american community of nations and the sioux religion can be found to have an influence far beyond the sioux people historythe sioux had the misfortune of becoming intimately acquainted with the westward thrust of american expansion at a time when american attitudes toward indians had grown cynical in the east and southeast from early colonial times there was much disagreement regarding the nature of the relations with the indian nations there was also a constant need to have allies among the indian nations during the period of european colonial rivalry on the north american continent a need that the newly formed united states felt with great urgency during the first generation of its existence after the war of 1812 things changed rapidly in the east and southeast indians as allies became much less necessary it was the discovery of gold in 1828 however at the far southern end of the cherokee nation near the border with georgia that set off a southern gold rush and brought an urgency to longdebated questions of what the nature of relations with the indian nations should be greed for gold would play a pivotal role in the undermining of sioux national independence at midcentury streams of men from the east first passed through sioux lands on their way to the gold fields of california they brought with them smallpox measles and other contagious diseases for which the sioux had no immunity and which ravaged their population by an estimated onehalf later in the 1870s the discovery of gold in the heart of paha sapa the black hills the sacred land of the sioux brought hordes of miners and the u s army led by lieutenant colonel george armstrong custer into the center of their sacred heart of everything that is in a blatant violation of the treaty of fort laramie of 1868 the sioux had no way of knowing about the process that had worked itself out in the east and southeast whereby in direct contravention of a u s supreme court decision  worchester vs georgia  indians would no longer be dealt with as sovereign nations no longer needed as allies and looked upon as merely being in the way indians entered a perilous time of being regarded as dependent domestic minorities many eastern and southern indian nations were uprooted and forced to remove themselves beyond the mississippi river by the time american expansion reached texas attitudes had hardened to a point at which texans systematically expelled or exterminated nearly all of the indians within their borders however sam houston during his terms as president of the republic of texas and as governor of the state of texas unsuccessfully attempted to accommodate the needs of indians into texas governmental policy to the sioux in the second half of the nineteenth century the u s government was duplicitous greedy corrupt and without conscience the sioux watched the great buffalo herds be deliberately exterminated by u s army policy and within a generation they found themselves paupers in their native land with no alternative but to accept reservation life they found it impossible to maintain honorable peaceful relations with the united states at first attempts were made to acculturate the sioux to assimilate them out of existence as a separate people then in the midtwentieth century the government attempted to legislate them out of existence through an official policy of termination of indian nations only within recent decades have there been attempts on the part of the u s government to redress past wrongs in the 1960s under the occasional prod of court decisions and a national consciousness focused on civil rights legislation for minorities attempts were made to recognize and respect significant remaining vestiges of indian sovereignty finally by legislation in 1979 indians were allowed to openly practice their religions without threat of criminal prosecution the gains have not come without bloodshed and strife however especially in the lands of the sioux and especially during the mid1970s — a time of virtual civil war on the pine ridge reservation alarmed by the bold actions and the extent of the demands by some groups of indians particularly the american indian movement aim the u s government tried to slow the pace of change by exploiting differences between the more acculturated indians and the more traditional indians since that time much healing has occurred but the question of what the nature of the relations between the native peoples of this continent and the people of the united states will be remains open modern erafederally recognized contemporary sioux tribal governments are located in minnesota nebraska north dakota south dakota and montana according to the 1990 census south dakota ranked eleventh among all states for the number of indians represented in its population 50575 which was 73 percent of the south dakota population up from 65 percent in 1980 minnesota ranked twelfth with a reported total of 49909 indians or 11 percent of its population up from 09 percent in 1980 montana ranked thirteenth with a reported total of 47679 indians or 60 percent of its population up from 47 percent in 1980 north dakota ranked eighteenth with a reported total of 25917 indians or 41 percent of its population up from 31 percent in 1980 nebraska ranked thirtyfifth with a reported total of 12410 indians or 08 percent of its population up from 06 percent in 1980 many native americans from these areas have migrated to urban industrial centers throughout the continent contemporary estimates are that at least 50 percent of the indian population in the united states now resides in urban areas frequently within the region of the tribal homeland but often at great distances from it other populations of sioux are to be found in the prairie provinces of canada acculturation and assimilation beginning in the late nineteenth century the u s government attempted to force the sioux to assimilate into american culture the prime weapon of cultural genocide as practiced by the united states was a school system contracted to missionaries who had little regard for traditional sioux culture language or beliefs sioux children isolated from their families were punished if they were caught speaking their native tongue their hair was cropped and school and dormitory life was conducted on a military model many children attended the school located at flandreau south dakota some sioux children were removed to schools in the east to hampton institute in virginia or to the indian school at carlisle pennsylvania while others attended the santa fe indian school and the haskell institute in lawrence kansas throughout this ordeal the sioux were able to retain their language and religion while learning english and adjusting to the demands of american culture some sioux began attaining distinction early in this process such as physician charles eastman today the sioux people are at home in both worlds sioux intellectuals and academicians such as noted author vine deloria jr and poet and scholar elizabeth cooklynn who also edits wicazo sa review a scholarly journal for native american studies professionals are leaders within their respective fields within the north american native american community traditional craftsthe sioux are skilled artisans at beadwork quillwork carving pipe making drum making flute making and leatherwork of all kinds — from competition powwow regalia to saddles and tack these are crafts that have been handed down from generation to generation intertribal powwow competitions festivals and tribal fairs bring forth impressive displays of sioux traditional crafts a large tribal arts and crafts fair is held annually at new town north

weekend at devils lake and fort totten north dakota health issuesall of the health problems associated with poverty in the united states can be found among the contemporary sioux people alcoholism has proven to be especially debilitating many traditional indian movements including aim have worked toward regaining pride in native culture including efforts to combat alcohol abuse and the toll that it takes among contemporary native peoples language the iroquoian language family the caddoan language family the yuchi language family and the siouan language family all belong to the macrosiouan language phylum indicating a probable divergence in the distant past from a common ancestor language geographically the iroquoian family of languages  seneca cayuga onondaga mohawk oneida and wyandot — also known as huron  are found in the northeast primarily in new york state and the adjacent areas of canada and in the southeast tuscarora originally in north carolina later in new york and cherokee in the southern appalachians and later in oklahoma  the caddoan language family includes the caddo wichita pawnee and arikara languages which are found on the central plains yuchi is a language isolate of the southern appalachians members of the siouan language family proper are to be found practically everywhere east of the rocky mountains except on the southern plains and in the northeast on the northern plains are found the crow hidatsa and dakota also known as sioux languages on the central plains are found the omaha osage ponca kansa and quapaw languages in wisconsin one finds the winnebago language on the gulf coast are the tutelo ofo and biloxi languages and in the southeast one finds catawba the immense geographical spread of the languages within this family is testimony to the importance of siouanspeaking peoples in the history of the continent they have been a people on the move for a very long time oral traditions among some of the siouanspeaking peoples document the approximate point of divergence for the development of a separate tribal identity and eventually the evolution of a separate language unintelligible to their former kinspeople siouanspeaking peoples of all contemporary tribal identities however share creation stories accounting for their origin as a people they come from the stars which can be contrasted for example with the macroalgonkian phylum muskogeanspeaking choctaws who emerged from a hole in the earth near the sacred mother mound nanih waiya it can be contrasted also with the aztectanoan phylum utoaztecanspeaking hopi who believe they have ascended upward through successive layers of worlds to the one they presently occupy siouanspeaking peoples also exhibit a reverence for the number seven whereas choctaws hold that the sacred number is four there are fundamental cultural differences between native american peoples whom europeans and americans have considered more similar than different for example the macrosiouan phylum iroquoianspeaking cherokees and the macroalgonkian phylum muskogeanspeaking choctaws have both been categorized by nonindians as members of the socalled five civilized tribes due to similarities in their material culture whereas knowledgeable choctaws consider the cherokees to have about three too many sacred numbers today the sioux language consists of three principal mutually intelligible dialects dakota santee lakota teton and nakota yankton the sioux language is not restricted to the united states but also extends far into the prairie provinces of canada the sioux were also masters of sign language an ancient vehicle of communication among peoples who are native to the north american continent the sioux language can be heard in a video documentary  wiping the tears of seven generations directed by gary rhine and fidel moreno kafaru productions 1992 which records interviews with a number of sioux members of the wounded knee survivors association as they relate what their grandparents told them about the 1890 massacre at wounded knee family and community dynamics the basic unit of traditional sioux family and community life is the tiyospaye a small group of related families in the era of the buffalo the tiyospaye was a highly mobile unit capable of daily movement if necessary a tiyospaye might include 30 or more households from these related households a headman achieved the position of leadership by demonstrating characteristics valued by the group such as generosity wisdom fortitude and spiritual power gained through dreams and visions acculturation assimilation and intermarriage have made inroads into sioux traditional family and community relationships the more isolated and rural portions of the population tend to be more traditional in traditional lakota community life fraternal societies called akicitas are significant within the life of the group during the era of the buffalo when lakota society was highly mobile fraternal societies helped young men develop leadership skills by assigning them roles in maintaining orderly camp movements membership was by invitation only and restricted to the most promising young men another kind of fraternity the nacas was composed of older men with proven abilities the most important of the nacas societies the naca omincia functioned as something of a tribal council operating by consensus it had the power to declare war and to negotiate peace a few members of the naca ominicia were appointed wicasa itancans who were responsible for implementing decisions of the naca ominicia many vestiges of traditional lakota community organizational structure have been replaced at least on the surface by structures forced upon the lakota by the u s government one important leader in the society was the wicasa wakan a healer respected for wisdom as well as curative powers this healer was consulted on important tribal decisions by the wicasa itancans and is still consulted on important matters by the lakota people today religion the sun dance also known as the offerings lodge ceremonial is one of the seven sacred ceremonials of the sioux and is a ceremonial for which they have come to be widely known the most famous sun dance occurs in early august at pine ridge the sun dance takes place in early july at rosebud and at other times among other sioux communities the ceremonials however are not performed for the benefit of tourists attendance by tourists is discouraged no american indian religion has been more closely studied or more widely known than the sioux religion partly due to the appeal of john niehardts book black elk speaks in which he recorded his interviews with the sioux spiritual leader earlier this century another reason for its prominence is because the american indian movement adopted many of the practices of the sioux religion for its own and carried those practices to many areas of the continent where they had not been widely known the socalled new age movement within american culture has also become captivated by the religious practices of the northern plains indians primarily the cheyenne and the sioux practices that are largely foreign to indians in many other areas of the continent but which are perceived by many americans as representative of indians in general yet until by act of congress the american indians religious freedom act of 1978 the practice of indian religions was a crime in the united states the practice of many native american religions throughout the continent was forced underground in the late nineteenth century as news spread about the massacre of 153 unarmed minneconjou sioux men women and children by the u s army at wounded knee on the pine ridge reservation on december 29 1890 the minneconjous camped at wounded knee creek had been holding a ghost dance attempting to fulfill the prophecies of the paiute visionary wovoka while fleeing their own agency after the murder of sitting bull they tried to reach what they perceived to be the safety of the protection of chief red cloud at pine ridge who was on friendly terms with the u s government perhaps because the massacre at wounded knee was one of sioux people on sioux land the sioux have been strong contemporary leaders in asserting the religious rights of native peoples these efforts have also been vigorously pursued on behalf of incarcerated native americans where penal authorities in practically every state historically have been contemptuous of the religious rights of native american inmates while the ceremonials of the sioux the sun dance the sweat lodge and other aspects of their religion may be foreign to many other native americans for example the sweat lodge a religious ceremonial among the sioux is merely a fraternal and communal event among the choctaws and many other native peoples one aspect of the sioux religion is nearly universal among north america s indians — the sanctity of land and the reverence for particular sacred lands for the sioux and for the cheyenne the sacred land is paha sapa known in american culture as the black hills and their major contemporary struggle is to regain it they have won a decision from the u s indian claims commission that paha sapa was taken from them illegally by the united states and that they are entitled to 122 million in compensation the sioux have rejected the award of money which being held in trust for them has now accumulated interest to a total of more than 400 million they are not interested in money they want paha sapa and there is precedent for their demand in 1970 congress passed and president richard nixon signed legislation returning blue lake — the sacred lake of taos pueblo — and 48000 surrounding acres to taos pueblo this was the first return of land to indians for religious purposes by the united states employment and economic traditions in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the u s government tried to force the sioux to become farmers cattle ranching however has become more important to them and many sioux derive some economic benefit from the cattle industry sioux have distinguished themselves on the professional rodeo and allindian rodeo circuits sioux reservations are isolated from urban industrial centers have attracted very little industry and experience some of the highest levels of unemployment and the highest levels of poverty of any communities within the united states for example on the cheyenne river reservation in the mid1980s unemployment averaged roughly 80 percent and 65 percent of all families were living on less than 3000 per year many sioux have found it necessary to leave their communities to find employment like many indian reservations various agencies of the u s government and programs funded by the government account for the largest percentage of jobs extractive industries also provide some employment but the economic benefits go largely to nonindians and many traditional sioux refuse to participate in economic activities that scar and pollute their land the discovery of uranium on sioux lands which has raised questions regarding if and how it should be extracted has been a divisive issue within sioux communities politics and government the structure and operation of the contemporary government of the lakota tribal division of the sioux serves as an example of that of other sioux governments the contemporary national government of the lakota nation is the national sioux council which is composed of delegates from the lakota reservations at cheyenne river standing rock lower brule crow creek pine ridge rosebud santee and fort peck the council meets annually to discuss matters affecting the entire lakota nation it is based on the traditional model of lakota government where the headman of each band represented the bands tribe and the headman of each lakota tribe represented the greater sioux council essentially a federal structure it also functions by the imposition of vote counting rather than consensus — a quintessential american indian method of decision making each contemporary lakota reservation is governed by an elected tribal council the organization of the cheyenne river reservation tribal council for example is a supreme governing body for the cheyenne river sioux it is empowered to enter into negotiations with foreign governments such as the government of the united states to pass laws and establish courts appoint tribal officials and administer the tribal budget certain kinds of actions by the tribal council however are subject to the authority of the secretary of the interior of the u s government a reminder that the sioux are not alone in their land the council consists of 18 members 15 of which are elected from six voting districts the districts being apportioned according to population and three who are elected at large — the chairperson the secretary and the treasurer the council elects a vicechairperson from among its members each tribal council member reports to the district tribal council for the district from which the council member was elected these district councils are locally elected to vote or hold office at cheyenne river one must be an enrolled tribal member and meet residency requirements for enrollment one must be onequarter blood or more cheyenne river sioux and ones parents must also have been residents of the reservation however a twothirds vote of the tribal council may enroll a person of cheyenne river indian blood who does not meet either the blood quantum or the parental residency requirements to vote one must meet a 30day residency requirement to hold office the residency requirement is one year the incident at oglalano other event typifies the problems encountered by traditional indians in seeking the redress of longstanding grievances with the united states more than the 71day siege of wounded knee in 1973 known as the incident at oglala when the siege ended in may of 1973 and when no network correspondents remained to tell the world what was happening on the pine ridge reservation traditional indians and supporters of the american indian movement aim endured a reign of terror that lasted for more than two years frightened by the takeover of the bureau of indian affairs building in washington d c and by the occupation of wounded knee the mixedblood leadership of the oglala lakota tribal government moved to crush political activism on the reservation while the aim leadership was in court federal authorities allowed and funded heavily armed vigilantes called goon squads guardians of the oglala nation who patrolled the roads and created a police state freedom of assembly freedom of association and freedom of speech ceased to exist violence reigned driveby shootings cars run off the road firebombings and murders became the norm during one 12month period there were more murders on the pine ridge reservation than in all the other parts of south dakota combined the reservation had the highest per capita murder rate in the united states by june of 1975 there had been more than 60 unsolved murders of traditional indians and aim supporters the fbi charged with solving crimes on indian reservations took little interest in the killings but when two fbi agents were killed near the community of oglala on the pine ridge reservation on june 26 1975 350 fbi agents were on the scene within three days two fbi agents new to the area and unknown to its residents were dressed in plain clothes and driving unmarked cars they reported that they were following a red pickup truck which they believed contained a man who was wanted for stealing a pair of boots the vehicle actually contained a load of explosives destined for an encampment of about a dozen members of the aim not far from the community of oglala when the two fbi agents followed the red pickup off the road and into a field to a point within earshot of the encampment a firefight erupted between the two fbi agents and the occupants of the vehicle who have never been identified armed only with their handguns the agents attempted to get their rifles out of the trunks of their cars and in so doing exposed themselves to the gunfire hearing the shooting and thinking themselves under attack men and women from the encampment came running carrying rifles they took up positions on a ridge overlooking the vehicles when fired at they returned the fire within a few minutes a third fbi agent arrived but not before the first two fbi agents lay dead near their vehicles the red pickup fled the scene but it had been seen and reported and the report preserved in the records of fbi radio transmissions the aim members on the ridge from the encampment went down to the vehicles and discovered the bodies of the two fbi agents bewildered and frightened they fled the area on foot under heavy fire as law enforcement authorities began arriving en masse but not before an indian man lay dead — shot through the head at long range the two fbi agents already wounded had been shot through the head at point blank range the full fury of the fbi descended on pine ridge reservation the director of the fbi appeared on television and announced a nationwide search for the red pickup in the months that followed the fbi was unable to find the red pickup or its occupants three men who had been at the aim encampment that day darrelle butler bob robideau and leonard peltier were arrested and charged with killing the two fbi agents no one was ever charged with killing the indian peltier in canada fought extradition butler and robideau however were tried and acquitted by a jury that believed they had acted in selfdefense and that they had not been the ones who executed the wounded agents the fury of the government then fell on the third defendant leonard peltier the united states presented coerced perjured documents to the canadian authorities to secure peltiers extradition from canada at the trial the red pickup truck now became a red and white van like the one to which leonard peltier could be linked fbi agents who had filed reports the day of the shooting reporting the red pickup now testified differently saying their reports had been in error the government now claimed that the two dead fbi agents who had reported that they were following a red pickup did not know the difference between a red pickup and a red and white van with the first trial as a blueprint for everything it had done wrong in the courtroom the government found a sympathetic judge in another jurisdiction who ruled favorably for the prosecution and against the defense disallowing testimony about the climate of violence and fear on the reservation and effectively thwarting the defense of selfdefense also by withholding the results of crucial fbi ballistics tests which showed that leonard peltiers weapon had not fired the fatal shots the government got a conviction against peltier he was sentenced to two life terms in the federal penitentiary a recent documentary  incident at oglala the leonard peltier story  through interviews with numerous participants examines in detail the events of the day the two fbi agents were killed and the government case against peltier revealing that in a fair trial peltier would have been acquitted as butler and robideau were and that the nature of his involvement was the same as theirs individual and group contributions academiasioux author professor and
