well first of all its not objectively important its important to many highschool aged people and to some older nostalgic people but not all it was never important to me i didnt go to my prom or take any interest in it if youre not into it thats fine theres nothing wrong with you theres nothing wrong with you if you are interested in it either a prom is a big fancydress dance party thrown every year in most us and canadian high schools there are generally two proms one for juniors and one for seniors and theyre held towards the end of the school year the tradition is that kids go to the prom in couples eg a boy will ask a girl to go to the prom with her or the girl asks the boy nowadays some samesex couples attend proms there are even kids who go to the prom alone but its traditionally a date night depending on how traditional a prom is theres a whole slew of rituals that are part of it asking a date or agreeing to be a date picking out a dress or tux going to the dates house to pick her up or being picked up pinning a corsage posing for pictures riding in a limo for those that can afford it crowning of prom kings and queens etc its important to many people for several reasons first of all for lots of kids high school looms large in their thoughts and feelings of course it does they have to be there every day with some time off for four years most dont have much experience with the outside world so high school is pretty much all they know—or at least know well so everything related to it seems extremely important its sometimes sold as the icing on the cake yes you have to do all this hard often boring work but the prize at the end is this big fun partyand the prom is the big event people students teachers and parents talk about it all year—or even for several years to some extent this is to purposefully build it up into a big exciting thing its communal advertising so that everyone will have something to be excited about added to which its a party many people love parties its much easier to get people pumped about a party than about a spelling bee there are exceptions of course some people such as introverts like me hate parties but if youre an introvert you learn at a young age that you have to fend for yourself society particularly highschool society tends to be geared for extroverts because proms loom so large in highschool life they tend to become what people talk about they generate buzz guess who danny asked to go to the prom with him did you hear about what happened at last years prom who are you going to ask even people who wouldnt naturally care have a hard time not getting caught up in the gossip our brains are rigged to care about what our tribemates are doing especially when it comes to romance and status and proms are all about that and for us descendants of huntergatherers highschool is the most tribal period of our lives its the closest we get to living in our natural environments proms are also important to people because they are rights of passage they are kind of like secular bar mitzvahs or modernday debutant coming out parties they are a ritualized transition from childhood to adulthood as with rituals in many cultures theres special clothing dancing and crowning of kings and queens this right of passage thing is very complicated because its 50 sanctioned by adults who often allow the prom to be a tad more sexualized than theyre normally okay with and 50 a tug of war between kids and adults kids tend to push the boundaries by doing things like spiking the punch sneaking outside to smoke pot staying out late having sex etc adults have a lovehate relationship with this rebelliousness which you see parodied romanticized and derided in movies and tv shows when something becomes a rite of passage many people feel they are missing out on an important life experience if they dont participate in it just as they might feel they havent really been to paris if they didnt visit the eiffel tower these markers allow people to say and feel that theyve done certain things—that theyve passed certain milestones that they havent missed out and these rites create a sort of shared folklore people from all over america can talk about their proms a 50yearold texan can have a conversation about proms with a 23yearold from connecticut proms are part of the american language to some extent the prom is simply important because it is which is to say that many traditions may have started for some specific reason but they carry on through inertia the prom is important to this generation because it was important to the last generation who talked it up to their kids and younger siblings and that last generation heard it talked up by the generation before them it is selfsustaining which is simply to say that its a tradition and traditions—to some extent—fuel themselves
