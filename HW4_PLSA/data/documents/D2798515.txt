poland in 1947 the parliament declared the area to be a museum on july 2 1947 simultaneously the first exhibition in the barracks was opened in stalinist poland on the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the first deportation of polish captives to camp auschwitz the exhibition was revised under assistance of former inmates however this exhibition was influenced by the cold war and next to pictures of jewish ghettos photos of slums in the usa were presented after stalins death a new exhibition was planned in 1955 which is basically still valid today in 1959 every nation who had victims in auschwitz received the right to present its own exhibition however victims like homosexuals jehovahs witnesses sinti and roma and yeniche people did not receive these rights the state of israel was also refused the allowance for its own exhibition as the murdered jews in auschwitz were not citizens of israel in april 1968 the jewish exhibition designed by andrzej szczypiorski was opened a scandal occurred in 1979 when pope john paul ii held a mass in birkenau and called the camp a  golgotha of our times in 1962 a prevention zone around the museum in birkenau and in 1977 one around the museum in auschwitz was established in order to maintain the historical condition of the camp these zones were confirmed by the polish parliament in 1999 in 1967 the first big memorial monument was inaugurated and in the 1990s the first information boards were set up the national exhibitions  editauschwitz death wall located near block 11 since 1960 the socalled national exhibitions have been located in the former concentration camp auschwitz i most of them were renewed from time to time for example those of belgium france hungary netherlands slovakia czech republic and the former soviet union the german exhibition which was made by the former gdr has not been renewed since the first national exhibition of the soviet union was opened in 1961 and renewed in 1977 and 1985 in 2003 the russian organizing committee suggested to present a completely new exhibition the soviet part of the museum was closed but the reopening was delayed as there were differences in the questions of the territorial situation of the soviet union between 1939 and 1941 the question of the territories annexed by the ussr during the war ie the baltic countries eastern poland and moldova could not be solved in 1978 austria opened its own exhibition presenting itself as a victim of national socialism this onesided view motivated 6 the austrian political scientist andreas maislinger to work in the museum within the action reconciliation service for peace arsp in 198081 later he founded the austrian holocaust memorial service the austrian federal president rudolf kirchschläger had advised maislinger that as a young austrian he did not need to atone for anything in auschwitz due to this disapproving attitude of the official austrian representation the austrian holocaust memorial service could not be launched before september 1992 filming  editthe museum has allowed scenes for four films to be filmed on the site pasażerka 1963 by polish director andrzej munk landscape after

appeared at the site leading to a proliferation of religious symbols which were eventually removed carmelite nuns opened a convent near auschwitz i in 1984 after some jewish groups called for the removal of the convent representatives of the catholic church agreed in 1987 one year later the carmelites erected an 8 m 26 ft tall cross from the 1979 mass near their site just outside block 11 and barely visible from within the camp this led to protests by jewish groups who said that mostly jews were killed at auschwitz and demanded that religious symbols be kept away from the site the catholic church told the carmelites to move by 1989 but they stayed on until 1993 leaving the cross behind in 1998 after further calls to remove the cross some 300 smaller crosses were erected by local
