the basic definition of a bunker is a fortified shelter used for emergencies and natural disasters there are several types if you are planning to bug in staying home in an emergency you will need one 1 storm shelter these are underground shelters designed to withstand tornados and other weather related disasters 2 bomb shelter there were very popular in the 1950s and 1960s and were usually small steel enclosures burred a few feet below ground in the back yard and were d esigned to help civilians survive the initial blast of a nuclear bomb and were designed to hold just a family for a few days to a week the military bomb shelter is much larger and complex and has internal power and ventilation and can hold many hundreds if not thousands of people think norad 3 fallout shelter again very popular in the 1950s and 1960s and were designed to help civilians survive the initial blast of a nuclear bomb but were usually community based and were designed for a few hundred people to survive a few days contact your local community government for locations near you 4 survival shelter now we get to the modern shelter survival shelters have become the most popular in recent years especially with ordinary citizens who want to stockpile food medicine and ammunition in case society breaks down the survival shelter has several basic parts the first being the shelter itself this should be at minimum a basement or fortified shed the shelter should have a minimum of two entrances and exits if you are under assault you will need more than one way out plus you will need to be able to fortify the entrances so no one can get in the second part is food and water the minimum amount of food and water you will need in your shelter is 3 days worth of food and water for each person dont forget your pets the third part is the basic essentials things like clothing medications light and heat sanitation and entertainment stockpile enough clothing for several days and keep seasons in mind keep a change of clothing for warm weather and cold weather appropriate footwear is important you dont want to spend a week in your basement in combat boots or slippers also you may have to venture out have a rain poncho boots and other attire for exploring after things calm down entertainment is important boredom is the worst enemy you will encounter when locked in a shelter for days if you have any medical conditions stockpile a weeks worth keep sanitation in mind as well what goes in must come out so get a sturdy 5 gallon bucket and some heavy bags for a make shift toilet outdoor stores sell toilet kits for buckets dont forget the tp lastly and not least is protection all the planning and preparation is worthless if you cannot protect your shelter and family a gun is the most useful item i recommend at least a 9mm and prefer a 45 with a minimum of 500 rounds of ammunition be sure to practice the best gun in the world is useless if you canâ€™t hit the side of a barn i also recommend have at least one shotgun 12ga with at least 100 rounds they are great for close quarters combat and can be used for hunting get 100 rounds of 00 buck and some slugs the slugs are great for hunting and the buck shot is for defense and can be used for smaller game like ducks rabbits and other game and practice practice practice one item your shelter could use is a generator if you can afford a whole house generator thats great but get a few of those battery packs or a smaller gas generator will do the one draw back for a gas generator is once you start it people are going to know you have it use sparingly and just to run the heat and to keep the frig cold stockpile some gas and be prepared to defend you generator there is one more shelter type i forgot to mention that is the cache these are used by people who instead of bugging in are planning on bugging out a cache is a storehouse of supplies used so you dont have to carry everything with you if you have to bug out these caches can be as simple as a change of clothes and some food and water stashed at you work or a complicated underground bunker several miles or hundreds of miles away with days or weeks of foodwater and ammunition if you have the means i would recommend you create a cache in you own backyard this can be as simple as a buried plastic tub with some food water ammunition and other items in case you have to abandon you base or cant get home and your shelter is looted this should be buried shallow but in a place no one can get to but easily enough for you to get to there is one golden rule when it comes to your shelter tell no one you friends might be cool now but after a few days of no food or water they will be knocking on your door and you may want to help but you cant feed all the grasshoppers in you neighborhood if you do get that knock on your shelter be prepared to help them or defend your stuff no one wants to think about self defense but others will not hesitate to hurt you to get food for themselves and their family so mentally prepare yourself for that eventuality its you or them never forget security if you have more than one person in your bunker sleep in shifts so one person is awake at all times to keep an eye on your property
