abraham lincoln was actually hated when presidentby m admin  jan 2 2014share 1 tweet stumble pin share2k“i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views” — abraham lincoln letter to horace greeley 1862in a nutshell abraham lincoln is widely accepted as one of the united states’ best presidents but while in office many of the american people not only thought he was doing a horrible job but also considered him to be a complete fool it wasn’t until his tragic assassination that he rose to the ubiquitous popularity he has today the whole bushel when lincoln took office in march 1861 he was entering a presidency he had won with only 398 percent of the popular vote reactions from the public were so negative that on the eve of his inauguration he had to be smuggled into the capital during the dead of night in a disguise he was looked down upon for everything from his humble beginnings and lack of education to his awkward appearance and high voice even the commanding general of his armies george mc clellan called him the “original gorilla” gives a whole new meaning to to term “og”in 1861 lincoln inherited a nation in crisis with the united states on the brink of civil war the american public was on edge and blamed lincoln for everything going wrong in the country of course southerners hated him for trying to change the way of life they’d known for years they resented him for trying to abolish slavery and declared their secession from the union on february 4 1861 but northerners weren’t fond of him either unimpressed with his slow start at the presidency they expected him to being doing more and to be doing it sooner people even hated his speeches the gettysburg address—now revered as one of the greatest speeches of all time and memorized by school children across the nation—was panned by many one chicago times writer said “the cheek of every american must tingle with shame as he reads the silly flat dishwatery utterances of a man who has to be pointed out to intelligent foreigners as the president of the united states” ouch lincoln’s wife mary todd lincoln said the constant deluge of insults wore on the president’s feelings and lincoln himself reportedly said “i would rather be dead than as president thus abused in the house of my friends” but he refused to take his criticisms too much to heart lincoln went on to win the reelection in 1864 and he led the north to victory when general robert e lee surrendered and ended the civil war on april 9 1865 lincoln was of course tragically shot by john wilkes booth just six days later of course lincoln also had his supporters during his presidency and his death was mourned by millions but it wasn’t until his assassination that he had a true surge in popularity sending him to the beloved status he has today it was only then as edwin stanton said that he was relinquished to the ages show me the proof

always have to deal with the grudge of those who voted for the other candidate and the growing disappointment of their own following and then theres the issue of being ahead of ones time  a recipe for trouble hillyard • 4 years ago this is not surprising most presidents get a lot of hate while in office for some such as gw bush it continues afterward and others are raised on a pedestal even george washington had a lot of hate from other politicians and the occasional news editor paladine • 4 years ago true but the difference is george w bush really is a horses ass ray • 4 years ago hes done more than you ever will john wibble • 4 years ago not many civilians get the chance to bomb 2 countries and ruin a countrys economy ray • 4 years ago mortgage backed securities are what ruined the economy and im pretty sure he didnt work for a banknorthernsentinel • 10 months ago the cra that forced banks to make loans to unqualified borrowers led to the financial meltdown gwb tried to do something about it but did not try hard enough he brought his concerns forward but perhaps was too concerned with going along to get along and was reassured by maxine waters and barney franks there is nothing wrong with freddie and fannie bush gets the blame in the minds of the liv but the policies that brought about the crash were planted long before in 1977 and nurtured by succeeding administrations mattimao • 2 years ago not a lot of civilians realize that the economy was already starting to fail while clinton was president not many civilians realize that actually happens a lot jimmy carter for exampledaniel lewis • 4 years ago the fact that the media hated him is no surprise you say he was hated but he was reelected what you should have said is that the elitist snobs hated lincoln but the public in the north did not heck if the media likes a president its the best sign that the president is doing a terrible job they only actively hate the best presidents dumas911 • 4 years ago gwb needs to be rounded up and parachuted into iraq he was on the verge of being a dictator he looked no different than most dictators when he landed on the aircraft carrier wearing a flight suit he shouldve just worn a complete dress uniform with every medal possible so he could look more like stalin hitler hussain or any other dictator who wearswore military dress especially when they werent actual generals etc i support our troops and the invasion of afganistan for osama but iraq is nothing but blood on bushs hands obamas not any better with his big brother cameras and wire taps this country needs its own arab sping and finally remind our government that they are there to serve the people and our own rights not their personal agenda and the rights of non american citizens or country i only hope that the president thats from my generation will have formed his own opinions and american values instead of being corrupted by their fathers first dont know where all that came from but i just felt the urge to say it arjan hut • 4 years ago i dont know where i found this photo  probably on listverse somewhere  but i really love looking at it trying to imagine what america would have been like back then with bobby kennedy for president a lot of people would have hated it very much for sure thats how these things go theres enough of hatred bitterness and fear in this world shoving us around  theres never a wrong time to start pushing back so i am inspired by your comment thanks for sharing paladine • 4 years ago john f kennedy and robert f kennedy were two great men cut down before they could achieve everything within their ability but while here they strove to do their best nick mulgrave • 4 years ago americans have an obsession with assassinated presidents and glorify them as if they were gods jfk was a womanizing punk who would never have been president if his father hadnt rigged the 1960 election with the help of the mafia i am pretty sure that if someone had shot george w bush or the current clown in office the american people would have praised them for being visionary leaders john wibble • 4 years ago people glorify jfk because he was the perfect leader a liberal democrat and as left wing as you can get rob davis • 3 years agononsense far from being a bigspending liberal kennedy was a conservative by the standards of both his time and today while he increased military spending overall he restrained federal outlays his plan for economic growth emphasized not deficits but taxrate cuts that he argued would eventually pay for themselves by increasing government revenue he reduced tariffs in pursuit of free trade and he took a hard line against communism abroad and at home  httpideastimecom2013 joe smith • 3 years ago basically the moral of that story is that american liberalism and conservatism as we know it today is relatively recent i suppose modern liberalism started with mc governhumphery in the late 60s while goldwater is often considered by many to be the founding father of conservatism again the kind as we know it todayyet would you believe that goldwater nixon and ford were all prochoice i believe reagan was prolife but i dont think he really did all that much regarding abortionwhats even more surprising is that his gigantic autobiography does not mention one peep about yet another super critical issue of politics todayhis judicial appointments yet its not like his appointments werent importanthe promised on the campaign trail that he would appoint the first female justice and did so on the first try of course his bork appointment didnt work out so well but that along with the later clarence thomas one is no doubt what made judicial appointments such a critical issue today rob • 3 years ago the media glorifies them more than the people the idea of a political dynasty with regard to camelot and the enchantment of that era is something popular film and media in general still has a very hard time relinquishing i imagine the reality of it has been rewritten nearly as many times as the bible joe smith • 3 years ago if bush was shot the liberals would celebrating like crazy just as they did when margaret thatcher passed away a few years ago now i have no use for obama at all as far as his politically ideology and such goes but i would never want someone shot or dead just because i dont like their political views lisa 39 • 4 years ago maybe you should run for president i agree with what you said right now our free country isnt so free and its only going to get worse until the politicians stop focusing on their own agendas and start taking care of john q public they really have forgotten that they work for usiamtherealgumby • 4 years ago as a reader it sure made me feel good writing it must have been elating at the very least lass curry • 4 years ago your a member of the kkk bitch zukiniandchurros • 1 year ago you realize that the kkk is the ku klux klan which only targeted former slaves clara t ohare • 4 years ago it doesnt matter if you are hated or loved what matters is morality and decency in your actions and deeds history will judge you not your peers scott • 4 years ago so what was so moral about what he did waging an illegal war against a country that had every right to break away while also completely stripping his citizens of their constitutional rights does not sound all that moral to me and before you start parroting the bullshit your 4th grade teacher told you about how the war was fought to free the slaves dont lincoln did not give two shits about freeing the slaves the emancipation proclamation was nothing more than a political stunt that actually accomplished nothing while giving the federal government the appearance of being on the moral high ground zukiniandchurros • 1 year ago lincoln freed the slaves because he was going to lose the war plus he was not the one who started the war it was on the brink of happening before he even became president loudestenemy • 1 year ago lincoln not only illustrated exactly why he had the legal authority to wage war he illustrated exactly why there was no legal justification for secession its in his first inaugural address he argued numerous times that slavery was wrong and evil and ought to be restricted his voting record was consistently against extending slavery in the territories you are the neoconfederate parrot sir clara t ohare • 4 years ago he saved america before the civil war people said things like the united states are after the civil war people would say  the united state is we are not simply a collection of states bur a great nation because of him slavery was banished and the usa went on to become the great nation that it is today the south was a motley collection of slave holders with no real unity among its people the cotton gin destroyed the way of life in a real way in the antebellum south lincoln destroyed slavery and southern injustice lincoln became a moral leader in not only banning slavery but he showed compassion and genorosity to the beleaguered southern population lincoln talked about those mystic chords of memory that stretch from the graves of our fallen heros to beseech the better angels of our nature lincoln used these better angels of our nature to rebuild the south and make it a better placecommonsenseforcommongoodcom • 4 years ago right lincoln and obama are the rule not the exceptions every decision maker is hated by some who oppose those decisions the ou7law • 4 years ago if i looked like lincolni would hate myself and my parents lol paladine • 4 years ago please pres lincoln wouldve broken you in half the ou7law • 4 years ago i would have climbed his ass and went ape shit

our world would still be dark and gloomy john wibble • 4 years ago lincoln had a disease which unnaturally formed his face prick the ou7law • 4 years ago thats why i said i would hate my parents douche guest • 4 years ago really i guess there is a president who is more hated than richard nixon and george bush hm8432 • 4 years ago yes barak the anointed one obama john wibble • 4 years ago nah bush is much worse than obama hm8432 • 4 years ago actually id call it even gwb and obama are the pierce and buchanan of their era ben frank • 4 years ago hardly a surprise scott • 4 years ago the great tyrant earned his name ray • 4 years ago youre an idiot scott • 4 years ago actually the idiot here must be you if you truly think lincoln was a great president he carried on an illegal war against our own people while completely suspending any semblance of constitutional rights for the rest of the country ya what a great fucking president id rate him right up there with obummer and hoover zukiniandchurros • 1 year ago the war was on the brink of happening before abe was even electedclay fincher • 11 months ago there are many similarities between lincoln and trump neither won the popular vote both were outsiders and hated by many including the press their speeches were panned they suffered constant insults and both will end up being reelected for a second term aaron josiah weaver • 1 year ago sounds like trump is following the same path time will tell loudestenemy • 1 year ago this is laden with all kinds of factual inaccuracies winfield scott told seward that there was an assassination plot lincoln snuck in mc clellan had major ego issues lincoln was incredibly studious the northerners that knew lincoln loved him the exception might be northern dems but even many respected him slow start as president they didnt like his handling of the war which was largely mc clellans fault it just depends on what one chooses to emphasize sources abraham lincoln and civil war america william gienapp the battle cry of freedom james mc pherson victoria • 2 years ago um no southerners didnt like him because he wanted to tax them because of the high profit the south was making by yes which was cotton corn fruits veggies ect that slaves made for southerners abe lincoln wanted to tax the south for profit he even mentioned it himself in addition abraham lincoln also wanted to send slaves back to africa technically everyone than was racists to an extent abe wanted segregation which he kept in place till martin luther kings time came and ended the discretion which martin king mentions in his i have a dream speech but one hundred years later the negro still is not free one hundred years later the life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination slavery didnt stop till martin luther kings time because black individuals still worked for little money lived in slums had separate restrooms back of the bus and were still slaves to the system thanks abraham for segregation sarcastically saying thanksanyways if youre going to tell it like it is best state it to the full facts i didnt like abraham because yeah he is a great example of that walking the fence racist separation of black  whitehowever grateful for martin luther king for ending slavery to the fullest
