example before i moved marketing i worked as a software engineer for 7 years i didn’t hate the job but i wasn’t in love with it either and i was doing more and more online marketing stuff during my free time after a while i assessed my skills realized i had enough skills to succeed in marketing and moved to a fulltime marketing role here’s how the swot would look like during that time assessing strengths and matching them to opportunities in my case the differences were somewhat obvious because i was switching to a completely different field but in some cases the pros and cons are not that obvious for example if you’re a senior software engineer in a software company you might have to make a decision about taking the management path or the technical path do you want that coveted tech lead positions that everyone is competing for or do you want a managerial position with all its responsibilities listing things down and doing a detailed swot analysis will help you make a better
