why bungee cord rebounders create too much acceleration force on the body december 2 2014 rebounders rebounding bellicon bellicon usa biomechanic bungee cord exercise health bounce lymphatic flush mini trampolines rebounder rebounder lymphatic rebounder weightloss rebounding scam sports any thorough biomechanical analysis of the impact of rebounding upon the joints and muscoskeletal system will include of course looking at acceleration forces and measuring data points on how the body sustains those stressors and how it responds or adapts to it the main unique benefit of rebounding of course is that for some brief repeated moments the body and cells can be put under increasing acceleration forces many times the earth’s natural gravity so for example most research studies show that all trampolines and rebounders will exert anywhere from 26 gforces on the body how is this possible if you were to simply jump standing on the ground you would sustain anywhere from 12 gforces depending on how high you jumped on a rebounder extra force potential is stored and released by the spring type through the mat and into your body by the elements either actual metal springs or bungee rubber cords from everything we know about impact analysis on joints and other soft and hard tissue higher acceleration forces can cause serious short term or long term damage depending on the intensity of that force and for how long it was sustained by the body in motion so this brings us to the important point that if most rebounder types and brands are creating significant acceleration force upon the body then ideally we want that force to be equally distributed throughout the body in a balanced movement as well as the body only briefly being exposed to the stress of that increasing mass in the difference between a healthy biological adaptive response versus negative depends on how long the organism is exposed to the stressor too much stress to the system causes imbalance and degeneration and just the right amount an opposite generative effect the body’s exposure to the stressor in the case we are discussing is increased gravity through a rebounding device bungee cord types like the bellicon and other brands jumpsport etc have a very long acceleration and deceleration wave that i discussed in the previous post this means that the body is exposed to anywhere from 26 g forces for 35 times longer than the optimal or ideal stress of impact window see fig 2in other words imagine yourself coming down on the mat of bellicon after a jump at the bottom of the jump the cords and mat has stretched to its furthest point so imagine this like the curve of a wave so as you are accelerated back upwards you are moving back up the wave towards the peak the research data measures how long the muscles and joints and ligaments etc have to endure those increased acceleration forces over what period of time or how long it takes for the mat to return to a flat plane while it may seem like just a few brief milliseconds and seem to not be a big deal for your health it actually can be after years of biomechanical research on how acceleration forces effect the body researchers can immediately look at data they have measured while participants are hooked up to various sensors and then can calculate if the force will have a positive adaptive effect or is too much for too long and will have a negative impactliterally both the positive and negative responses build up exponentially over time what is harder to calculate is time in terms of how long the major health consequences will start to appear in the consumer’s body so if you are jumping on a bellicon the variables of how high you are jumping your state of health weight height may mean that you will see muscoskeletal problems in a couple months or a couple years maybe longer maybe less time either way though the conclusions are clear that some brands or types would be recommended and some not since there are no long term studies breaking down the negative adaptive responses the best information source would be gathered from the field through interviewing customers who have purchased and used various brands for years spring type components made from metal hold and release potential energy quite differently from rubber elastomers in the bugee cords metal springs either don’t need to be replaced or do but can sustain longer usage so provide consistent acceleration forces over time the tensile strength is far greater which means with each bounce the coils do not stretch apart nearly as much and so the tensile strength on the mat is also far greater leading to mats that remain much more flat or on a perpendicular plane to the horizontal of the feet placement the mat stays more fixed in that position throughout the whole movement this is generally true for rebounders that are under 40 inches in diameter frame as the deceleration time as you land on the mat is far shorter the acceleration wave is also shorter and gforces on the body are sustained for a fraction of the time versus rubber bungees so your body may sustain 5gs on a bellicon for 6 times longer than a metal rebounder this has been found on cheap metal trampolines to higher end rebounder brands to compound that negative stress and consequences on the body if one’s structural integrity is already compromised 85 of people or is being compromised through pronation of ankles and knees on the mat see previous post talking about bellicon and bungees then for the body to sustain an average of 35gs for longer periods of time can significantly stress those vital points on the body and increase loss in structural integrity over time advertisements leave a comment
