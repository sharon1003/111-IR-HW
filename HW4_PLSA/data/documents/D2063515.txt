supply side economics  a discussion of supply side economics its correlation with reaganomics and its justification for tax cuts reaganomics supply side economics republican economics tax cut justifications corporate welfare supply side economics  reaganomics and the case for tax cuts supply side economics supplyside economics is a school of macroeconomic thought which emphasizes the supply part of supply and demand the central concept of supplyside economics is says law supply creates its own demand the idea that one must sell before one can afford to buy therefore good economic policy encourages increased production versus attempts to stimulate demand â€” this is the fundamental dispute between classical supplyside economics and keynesian economics or demand side economics supplyside economics is often conflated with trickle down economics supplyside economics was popularised in the 1970s by the ideas of robert mundell arthur laffer and jude wanniski the term was coined by wanniski in 1975 in 1978 jude wanniski published the way the world works in which he laid out the central thesis of supplyside economics and detailed the failure of high taxrate progressive income tax systems and u s monetary policy under keynesians in the 1970s wanninski advocated lower tax rates and a return to some kind of gold standard ala the 19441971 bretton woods system in 1983 economist victor canto a disciple of arthur laffer published the foundations of supplyside economics this theory focuses on the effects of marginal tax rates on the incentive to work and save which affect the growth of the supply side or what keynesians call potential output while the latter focus on changes in the rate of supplyside growth in the long run the new supplysiders often promised shortterm results supplyside economics developed during the 1970s of the keynesian dominance of economic policy and in particular the failure of demand management to stabilize western economies in the stagflation of the 1970s in the wake of the oil crisis in 1973 it drew on a range of nonkeynesian economic thought particularly the austrian school eg joseph schumpeter and monetarism as in classical economics monetarism proposed that production or supply is the key to economic prosperity and that consumption or demand is merely a secondary consequence early on this idea had been summarised in says law of economics which states a product is no sooner created than it from that instant affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value john maynard keynes the founder of keynesianism summarized says law as supply creates its own demand he turned says law on its head in the 1930s by declaring that demand creates its own supply however says law does not state that production creates a demand for the product itself however but rather a demand for other products to the full extent of its own value more simply it is only after we produce and have income to spend that we can demand the supplysiders were influenced strongly by the idea of the laffer curve which states that that tax rates and tax revenues were distinct  that tax rates too high or too low will not maximize tax revenues supplysiders felt that in a high tax rate environment lowering taxes to the right level can raise revenue by causing faster economic growth they pointed to the tax cuts of the kennedy administration and the high rates of the hoover and nixon administrations in justification this led the supplysiders to advocate large reductions in marginal income and capital gains tax rates to encourage allocation of assets to investment which would produce more supply jude wanniski and many others advocate a zero capital gains rate the increased aggregate supply would result in increased aggregate demand hence the term supplyside economics furthermore in response to inflation supplysiders called for indexed marginal income tax rates as monetary inflation had pushed wage earners into higher marginal income tax brackets that remained static that is as wages increased to maintain purchasing power with prices income tax brackets were not adjusted accordingly and thus wage earners were pushed into higher income tax brackets than tax policy had intended supplyside economics has been criticised as essentially politically conservative supplyside advocates claim that they are not following an ideology but are reinstating classical economics however some economists see similarities between supplyside proposals and keynesian economics if the result of changes to the tax structure is a fiscal deficit then the supplyside policy is effectively stimulating demand through the keynesian multiplier effect supplyside proponents would point out in response that the level of taxation and spending is important for economic incentives not just the size of the deficit critics of supplyside economics such as paul krugman claim that supplyside economics was always a smokescreen for politicallymotivated tax cuts they point to reaganera director of the office of management and budget david levinsons admission that supplyside doctrine of acrosstheboard tax cuts embodied in centerpiece legislation commonly known as the kemproth tax cut was always a trojan horse to bring down the top marginal income tax rate the administration justified such changes in socioeconomic terms with the argument that benefits would trickle down to poorer americans this conservative political argument in favor of supplyside policy is not part of supplyside thought however for example jude wanniski argued for lower tax rates to increase tax revenues and increase production something favored by political conservatives but also argued that redistribution of income through taxation was essential to the health of the polity  anathema to political conservatives marx and smith both supplysiders and their opponents have been keen to claim the mantles of thinkers as diverse as karl marx and adam smith jude wanniski has claimed both as supplyside thinkers due to their advocacy of a gold monetary standard and more specifically their focus on the agents of production in an economy barton biggs chief investment strategist of morgan stanley described wanniskis book about supplyside economics the way the world works as the most important economic book published since marxs writings supplyside vs monetarism  new classical economics supplyside supporters disagreed with monetarist milton friedman and neoclassicist robert lucas jr by arguing that cutting tax rates alone would be sufficient to grow gdp lift tax revenues and balance the budget friedman however retained a more conventional monetarist view believing that while tax cuts were on the whole desirable money supply was the crucial variable supported by the powerful editorial page of the wall street journal seconded by the washington times supplyside economics became a force in public policy starting in the early 1980s reaganomics in the united states commentators frequently equate supplyside economics with reaganomics the fiscal policies of ronald reagan were largely based on supplyside economics during reagans 1980 presidential campaign the key economic concern was double digit inflation which reagan described as too many dollars chasing too few goods but rather than the usual dose of tight money recession and layoffs with their consequent loss of production and wealth he promised a gradual and painless way to fight inflation by producing our way out of it switching from an earlier monetarist policy federal reserve chair paul volcker began a policy of tighter monetary policies such as lower money supply growth to break the inflationary psychology and squeeze inflationary expectations out of the economic system therefore supplyside supporters argue that reaganomics was only partially based on supplyside economics however under reagan congress passed a plan that would slash taxes by 749 billion over five years as a result jason hymowitz cited reagan â€” along with jack kemp â€” as a great advocate for supplyside economics in politics and repeatedly praised his leadership critics of reaganomics claim it failed to produce much of the gains laffer and other supplysiders had promised krugman later summarised the situation when ronald reagan was elected the supplysiders got a chance to try out their ideas unfortunately they failed although he credited supplyside economics for being more successful than monetarism which he claimed left the economy in ruins he stated that supplyside economics produced results which fell so far short of what it promised describing the supplyside theory as free lunches krugman and other critics point to increased budget deficits during the reagan administration as proof that the laffer curve is wrong supplyside advocates respond by pointing out this is a conflation of revenues and expendituresthe laffer curve says nothing about budgets an arithmetic operation the sum of revenues and expenditures but only speaks to revenues they would point to the sizable increase in tax revenues under reagan table 1 as proof that moving down the laffer curve from a prohibitively high rate to a more appropriate lower rate does increase revenues on the other hand tax revenues as a percentage of gdp actually decreased during reagans tenure another key point though is that what the government then does with those increased revenues is a separate political question and thus supplysiders argue that their tax policy prescriptions are distinct from budget expenditure prescriptionssupplysiders are focused on how to maximize production not advocating how best to consume it has been contended by some supplyside critics that the argument to lower taxes to increase revenues was a smokescreen for starving the government of revenues and who hoped that the tax cuts would lead to a commensurate drop in government spending however this did not turn out to be the case paul samuelson called this notion the tape worm theory â€” the idea that the way to get rid of a tape worm is stab your patient in the stomach supplyside advocates like wanniski counter that social and fiscal conservatives who supported the supplyside prescription on tax policy for this reason were misguided and did not understand the laffer curve fiscal policy theory supplyside economics holds that increased taxation steadily reduces economic trade between economic participants within a nation and that it discourages investment taxes act as a type of trade barrier or tariff that causes economic participants to revert to less efficient means of satisfying their needs as such higher taxation leads to lower levels of specialization and lower economic efficiency the idea is said to be illustrated by the laffer curve case  fair 1999 780 781 crucial to the operation of supplyside theory is the expansion of free trade and free movement of capital it is argued that free capital movement in addition to the classical reasoning of comparative advantage frequently allows an economic expansion lowering tax barriers to trade provides to the domestic economy all the advantages that the international economy gets from lower tariff barriers supplyside economists have less to say on the effects of deficits and sometimes cite robert barroâ€™s work that states that rational economic actors will buy bonds in sufficient quantities to reduce long term interest rates critics argue that standard exchange rate theory would predict instead a devaluation of the currency of the nation running the high budget deficit and eventual crowding out of private investment according to mundell fiscal discipline is a learned behavior to put it another way eventually the unfavourable effects of running persistent budget deficits will force governments to reduce spending in line with their levels of revenue this view is also promoted by victor canto the central issue at stake is the point of diminishing returns on liquidity in the investment sector is there a point where additional money is pushing on a string to the supplyside economist reallocation away from consumption to private investment and most especially from public investment to private investment will always yield superior economic results in standard monetarist and keynesian theory however there will be a point where increases in asset prices will produce no new supply that is where investment demand will outrun potential investment supply and produce instead asset inflation or in common terms a bubble the existence of this point and where it is should it exist is the essential question of the efficacy of supplyside economics monetary policy theory supplysiders advocate that monetary policy should be based on a price rule the aim of monetary policy should be to target a specific value of money irrespective of the quantity of money that must be created or withdrawn by the central bank to achieve this target this contrasts with monetarisms focus on the quantity of money and keynesian theorys emphasis on real aggregate demand the important difference is that to a monetarist the quantity of money specifically represented by the money supply is the crucial determining variable for the relationship between the supply and demand for money while to a keynesian adequate demand to support the available money supply is important keynes famously remarked that money doesnt matter this is an area where supplyside theory has been particularly influential under macroeconomic theory the general level of price was based on the strict increase in price of a basket of goods under supplyside theory the rate of inflation should be based on the substitutions that individuals make in the market place and should take into account the improved quality of goods in the late 1980s and through the 1990s under presidents of both american political parties shifts were made in the calculation of the broadly followed measure of inflation the consumer price index for urban consumers or cpiw which reflected supplyside ideas on substitution the argument for factoring in goods quality was not accepted which has led supplyside economists to claim that the real cpi is actually between 5 and 1 lower than the stated rate this area represents one of the points of contention between conservative economic theorists who argue for a quantity of money theory of inflation including austrian economics many strict gold standard economists and traditional monetarists and supplyside theorists according to the increases in money supply during the 1990s the real rate of inflation must be higher than is currently stated these economists argue that the cost of housing is understated in the cpiw and that the inflation rate should be between 5 and 1 higher it is for this reason that many central bankers investment analysts and economists follow the gdp deflator which measures the total output of the society and the prices paid for all goods not merely consumer goods typically supplysiders view gold as the best unit of account with which to measure the price of fiat money which is defined as a money supply not directly limited by specie or hard assets hence the purest supplysiders are in general advocates of a gold standard however the reverse is not true many gold standard advocates are harsh critics of supplyside economics supplyside economists assert that the value of money is purely dictated by the supply and demand for money in fiat money system the government has a legislated monopoly on the supply of base money hence it has complete control over the value of money any decline in the value of money or appreciation is hence viewed as the result of errant central bank policy u s monetary and fiscal experience supplyside economists seek a cause and effect relationship between lowering marginal rates on capital formation and economic expansion the supplyside history of economics since the 1960s hinges on the following key turning points the 1960s the kennedy tax cuts which reduced marginal rates are believed by supplyside economists to be responsible for the 1960s prosperity the more generally accepted political stand among supplyside detractors is that the tax program of 1963 by reducing the incentives to shelter income reduced economic distortion for example while the theoretical top bracket rate was originally 90 in practice no one paid this rate using various loopholes and deductions to avoid paying the 1970s in 1971 president nixon ended the gold standard in the u s in 1971 president nixon ended the gold standard in the u s in 1971 richard nixon ended the convertibility of the us dollar into gold which meant the end of the bretton woods system commodity prices including oil and gold particularly which had been rising steadily in response to the dollar glut spiked upwards the supplyside explanation for this event is that taxation on investment had depleted the incentive to capital investment either in new sources of materials or in substitute goods which when combined with eroding confidence in the u s dollar cause it to be rapidly devalued many supply siders agree with gold investors in saying that the value of commodities remained constant and that it was the dollar that devalued at the same time the mundellfleming model of currency flows gained greater credence when it was codified into a single set of equations and became increasingly influential in neoliberal economics the argument for a floating currency regime had first been adopted by friedman but supplyside economists such as wanniski typically argued that exchange rates should be fixed relative to gold mundell was the author of the influential view that it was johnsons budget deficits that were the cause of inflationary pressure however as lester thurow pointed out the standard model of inflationary pressure shows that johnsons peak year of deficits would have created only a small upward pressure that instead it was persistent american trade deficits through the 1960s which had a greater effect on the imbalance between the value of the u s dollar and the gold to which it was in theory convertible robert mundell believes nixons failure to cut taxes in the early 1970s to be the cause of stagflation his argument being that the incentive for individuals to invest was reduced to below zero measuring the sp 500 in inflationadjusted terms the stock market lost half of its value between the market peak of 1972 and its bottom in 1982 with money seeking better returns in real estate and commodities instead the argument from the supplyside point of view then goes on to state that the cuts in capital gains tax rates that were part of the 1981 tax package returned incentives to invest the keynesian point of view is that after a long bear market money had fled from stocks and was set to return once the expectation of inflation had been reduced neither of these two arguments fully accounts for the rise of equities over the course of the long bull market of 19822000 the importance of this argument needs to be seen in light of the effects of the inflation of the late 1970s where credit became constricted as interest rates rose rapidly and the number of borrowers who could qualify for even standard mortgages fell inflation acted as a tax on wage increases because the highly progressive income tax system of the time meant that more and more households suffered from bracket creep  in which a wage increase would be reduced in value by the increased taxes collected the effects of inflation produced in 1980 a strong political consensus for a change in basic policy reaganomics ronald reagan made supplyside economics a household phrase and promised an across the board reduction in income tax rates and an even larger reduction in capital gains tax rates case  fair 1999 781 782 when vying for the republican party presidential nomination for the 1980 election george h w bush derided reagans supplyside policies as voodoo economics however later he seemed to give lip service to these policies to secure the republican nomination in 1988 and is speculated by some to have lost in his reelection bid in 1992 by allowing tax increases see read my lips no new taxes supplyside economics was critiqued from the right as well for example hard gold standard advocates such as the ludwig von mises institute have argued that there is no such thing as a dollar merely a specific quantity of gold therefore according to this view the entire central bank mechanism which supplyside economics advocates is a needless fiction which creates anomalies in the price of commodities in their view the central problem was that the united states needed to reassert a hard gold standard first and this would force the necessary reductions in expenditures the centrepiece of the supplyside argument is the economic rebound from the 19801982 double dip recession combined with the continued fall in commodity prices the across the board tax cuts of 1981 are seen as the great motivator for the seven fat years critics of this view point out that the rebound from the reagan recession of 19811982 is exactly in accordance with the disinflation scenario predicted by islm models of the late 1970s essentially that the increases in fed funds rates squeezed out inflation and that federal budget deficits acted to prime the pump this model had been the basis of volckers federal reserve policy in 1981 robert mundell told ronald reagan that by cutting upper bracket taxation rates and by lowering tax rates on capital gains national output would increase so much that tax revenues would also increase mundell claimed that the economic expansion would also mop up excess liquidity and bring inflation back under control after the tax cuts were implemented nominal revenues quickly returned to and ultimately surpassed previous levels while revenues dropped as a share of gdp supplysiders note they intended for this fall to happen since cutting tax rates would preclude a rise in taxes collected relative to national income the question of whether the tax cuts proved mundells predictions correct has sparked much debate between supplysiders and mainstream economists while nominal revenues rebounded after the tax cuts mainstream economists note that comparing nominal tax collections over time fails to take into account inflation by converting tax revenues from nominal to real terms these economists have shown that tax revenues did not surpass their 1981 levels until 1987 criticism critics of supplyside economics pointed to the lack of academic credentials by movement leaders such as jude wanniski and robert bartley to imply that the theories were bankrupt mundell in his nobel prize lecture countered that the success of price stability was proof that the supplyside revolution had worked the continuing debate over supplyside policies tends to focus on the massive federal and current account deficits that have accumulated in the u s since 1980 although the laffer curve only predicts revenue increases and has nothing to do with government spending after the emergence of supplyside economics several economists using supplyside theory began advocating a flattax system while generally associated with conservative politics such as former presidential candidate steve forbes flattax systems based on valueadded taxes have been proposed by liberal economists and by at least one democratic presidential candidate citation neededthe paradigm of a tax system which rewards investment over consumption was accepted across the political spectrum and no plan not rooted in supplyside economic theories has been advanced in the united states since 1982 with the exception of the clinton tax cuts of 1993 which had any serious chance of passage into law in 1986 a tax overhaul described by mundell as the completion of the supplyside revolution was drafted it included increases in payroll taxes decreases in top marginal rates and increases in capital gains taxes combined with the mortgage interest deduction and the regressive effects of state taxation  it produces closer to a flattax effect proponents such as mundell and laffer point to the dramatic rise in the stock market as a sign that the tax overhaul was effective although they note that the hike in capital gains may be more trouble than it was worth the 1990s supplysiders blame the 1991 recession on the federal reserve and argue that clintons tax increases since they did not change marginal capital gains tax rates left the supplyside nature of the 1986 tax bill in place similarly supplyside economists have argued that since the early phases of the massive tax breaks of george w bushs first two years were based on credits and not cuts in marginal rates they did not act to stimulate the economy although the effect on individual income remains the same more generally traditional economists point to the overhang of deficits from the reagan era the sl bailout the effects of a ballooning federal budget deficit the defense budget cuts which began in earnest in 1989 and the expectation of a lack of continued fiscal discipline as the source of the recession these arguments blame the legacy of democratic deficits forced upon reagan rather than deficits created by reagans own administration critics of supplyside economics often argue the inflated government deficits that accompanied the arrival of supplyside economics are of greater concern than the economic and stock market success of supplyside theory a trojan horse stronger critiques of supplyside economics dismiss the entire project as a complete failure which is a trojan horse for reducing marginal tax rates on upper income brackets these critiques are found in samuel bowles work which argues that real productivity fell under supplyside taxation regimes on a unitworker basis paul krugman of princeton called supplyside economics peddling prosperity and dismissed it as being unworthy of serious economists in a 1994 book written for the general audience since krugmans early work was in international currency areas the very theory for which mundell received his nobel prize his criticism was drawn in specifically sharp terms these criticisms point to the explosion in deficits and the conversion of price volatility to currency volatility as proofs that supplyside economics does not work supplyside defenders counter that the theory was never designed to consider government spending and therefore cannot be blamed for this outcome they also counter that tax revenues and the economy grew under supplyside policy as predicted and that the laffer curve worked as advertised in 2003 the wall street journal declared the debate over supplyside economics to have ended with a whimper after extensive modelling performed by the congressional budget office failed to support supplyside policies it was also suggested that dan crippen may have lost his chance at reappointment as head of the cbo for failing to support supplyside inspired dynamic scoring supplyside economics in popular culture supplyside economics have been discussed and critiqued in books songs and films the social activist and cartoonist dan perkins who writes under the pen name tom tomorrow has repeatedly criticised the theory in his weekly cartoon this modern world it was also mentioned by ben stein in the popular 1986 movie ferris buellers day off comedian and author al franken lampoons supply side economics in his 2004 book lies and the lying liars who tell them  a fair and balanced look at the right in a comic book style chapter illustrated by don simpson cartoonist entitled the gospel of supply side jesus related sites  exchange links with this article
