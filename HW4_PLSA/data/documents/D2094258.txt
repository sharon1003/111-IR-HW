phil doesnt suffer fools gladly he punches first and thinks later dont mess with this east end hard nut or else originally a nicer guy he was conned by so many people he eventually took on a crime boss mantle as a way to get revenge on the world its a reflection of his ability to cover his tracks silence witnesses and of his trusted briefs knowledge of legal loopholes that phils only been in

grand matriarch peggy looked on proudly not to mention his son and daughter  ben and louise but the trouble with family is they let you down phil and grant had a tempestuous relationship originally the friendlier and calmer of the mitchell bruvs keeping grant in check and preferring to resolve problems with enemies through mind games instead of grants approach of sheer violence in the end lifes knocks turned phil badder and madder even grant wrecked his life before emigrating and phil then took on grants bad boy mantle contents  show19902000 you should see this place it is right and i have
