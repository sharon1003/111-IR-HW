editthe first book in the mary poppins book series was the films main basis according to the 40th anniversary dvd release of the film in 2004 disneys daughters fell in love with the mary poppins books and made him promise to make a film based on them disney first attempted to purchase the film rights to mary poppins from p l travers as early as 1938 but was rebuffed because travers did not believe a film version of her books would do justice to her creation in addition disney was known at the time primarily as a producer of cartoons and had yet to produce any major liveaction work for more than 20 years disney periodically made efforts to convince travers to allow him to make a poppins film he finally succeeded in 1961 although travers demanded and got script approval rights the sherman brothers composed the music score and were also involved in the films development suggesting the setting be changed from the 1930s to the edwardian era preproduction and song composition took about two years preproduction  edittravers was an adviser to the production however she disapproved of the dilution of the harsher aspects of mary poppins character felt ambivalent about the music and so hated the use of animation that she ruled out any further adaptations of the later mary poppins novels 9 she objected to a number of elements that actually made it into the film rather than original songs she wanted the soundtrack to feature known standards of the edwardian period in which the story is set she also objected to the animated sequence disney overruled her citing contract stipulations that he had final say on the finished print much of the traversdisney correspondence is part of the travers collection of papers in the mitchell library of new south wales australia the relationship between travers and disney is detailed in mary poppins she wrote a biography of travers by valerie lawson the biography is the basis for two documentaries on travers the real mary poppins and lisa matthews the shadow of mary poppins 10 11 12 their relationship during the development of the film was also dramatized in the 2013 film saving mr banks casting  editjulie andrews who was making her feature film acting debut after a successful stage career got the prime role of mary poppins soon after she was passed over by jack l warner and replaced with audrey hepburn for the role of eliza doolittle in his screen adaptation of my fair lady even though andrews had originated the role on broadway 13 when disney first approached andrews about taking on the role andrews was three months pregnant and therefore was not sure she should take it disney assured her that the crew would be fine with waiting to begin filming until after she had given birth so that she could play the part 14 julie andrews also provided the voice in two other sections of the film during  a spoonful of sugar  she provided the whistling harmony for the robin and she was also one of the pearly singers during supercalifragilisticexpialidocious david tomlinson besides playing mr banks provided the voice of marys talking umbrella and numerous other voiceover parts including that of admiral booms first mate during the jolly holiday sequence the three singing cockney geese were all voiced by marni nixon a regular aural substitute for actresses with substandard singing voices nixon would later provide the singing voice for hepburn in my fair lady and play one of andrews fellow nuns in the sound of music andrews later beat hepburn for the best actress award at the golden globes for their respective roles andrews would also win the academy award for best actress for her role hepburn did not receive a nomination richard sherman one of the songwriters also voiced a penguin as well as one of the pearlies 15 robert sherman dubbed the speaking voice for jane darwell because darwells voice was too weak to be heard in the soundtrack shermans voice is heard saying the only line feed the birds tuppence a bag 16disney cast dick van dyke in the key supporting role of bert after seeing his work on the dick van dyke show after winning the role of bert van dyke lobbied to also play the senior mr dawes but disney originally felt he was too young for the part van dyke eventually won disney over after a screen test 17 although he is fondly remembered for this film van dykes attempt at a cockney accent is regarded as one of the worst film accents in history cited as an example by actors since as something that they wish to avoid 18 in a 2003 poll by empire magazine of the worst film accents of all time he came second 19 van dyke claims that his accent coach was the irish j pat omalley who didnt do an accent any better than i did 20filming  editfilming took place between may and september 1963 with postproduction and animation taking another 11 months 21the film changed the books storyline in a number of places for example mary when approaching the house controlled the wind rather than the other way around as another example the father rather than the mother interviewed mary for the nanny position a number of other changes were necessary to condense the story into feature length in the film there are only two banks children jane and michael the satirical and mysterious aspects of the original book gave way to a cheerful and disneyfied tone mary poppins character as portrayed by andrews in the film is somewhat less vain and more sympathetic towards the children compared to the rather cold and intimidating nanny of the original book bert as played by van dyke was a composite of several characters from travers stories travers demanded that any suggestions of romance between mary and bert be eliminated so lyrics were written for jolly holiday that clearly indicated that their friendship was purely platonic some subtle hints of romance however did remain in the finished film music  editbuena vista records released the original motion picture soundtrack on lp and reeltoreel tape 22 due to time constraints some songs were edited such as step in time and jolly holiday a spoonful of sugar while songs also featured introductory passages supercalifragilisticexpialidocious or completed endings sister suffragette fidelity fiduciary bank a man has dreams written by richard and robert sherman the songs were inspired by edwardian british music hall music 23 the score won two grammy awards and two academy awards 24 25walt disney records reissued the soundtrack in 1997 including a 16minute track of unreleased songs and demo versions 26 in 2004 as part of the 40th anniversary also called special edition a 28track disc as part of a twodisc set was released 27 in 2014 the 50th anniversary of the films release the soundtrack was released in a 3cd edition as part of the walt disney records the legacy collection series this edition includes demos of many lost tracks 28soundtrack  editmain article mary poppins soundtrackall tracks are written by richard m sherman and robert b sherman deleted songs  edita number of other songs were written for the film by the sherman brothers and either rejected or cut for time richard sherman on the 2004 dvd release indicated that more than 30 songs were written at various stages of the films development no cast recordings of any of these songs have been released to the public only demos or later performances done by the songwriters — with the exception of the rooftop reprise of chim chim cheree and the smoke staircase yodel mentioned below the chimpanzoo  was originally to follow i love to laugh during the uncle albert ceiling tea party sequence but it was dropped from the soundtrack just before julie andrews and company were to record it the fastpaced number was not unveiled to the public until richard sherman aided by recently uncovered storyboards performed it on the 2004 dvd edition the recreation suggests it was to have been another sequence combining animation and live action practically perfect  was intended to introduce mary but instead the melody of the piece was used for sister suffragette used to introduce mrs banks a different song with the same name was written for the stage musical the eyes of love  a romantic ballad intended for bert and mary but according to richard sherman andrews suggested privately to disney that this song was unsuitable in response a spoonful of sugar was written mary poppins melody  was to be performed when mary introduces herself to the children elements of the song later became part of  stay awake  the melody was the basis for a couple of other songs that were ultimately cut from the film a names a name  heard on a recording taken of a meeting between the sherman brothers and travers this song was originally intended for the nursery scene that later became a spoonful of sugar the melody was reused for mary poppins melody you think you blink  was a short piece that bert was to sing just before entering the chalk painting and starting the jolly holiday sequence in the film dick van dyke simply recites the lyric instead of singing it west wind  was a short ballad to be sung by mary the song was later retitled mon amour perdu and used in the later disney film big red the right side  was to be sung by mary to michael after he gets out of bed cranky it was recycled for the disney channel television series welcome to pooh corner as winnie the pooh s personal theme song measure up  was to accompany the scene in which mary takes the tape measure to jane and michael admiral boom  was to be the theme song for the cannonfiring neighbor of the banks residence but it was cut by walt disney as being unnecessary the melody of the song remains in the film and the bombastic theme is heard whenever boom appears onscreen one line from this song the whole world takes its time from greenwich but greenwich they say takes its time from admiral boom is spoken by bert early in the film sticks paper and strings  was an early version of lets go fly a kite lead the righteous life  an intentionally poorly written hymn was to have been sung by katie nanna  elsa lanchester along with jane and michael prior to mary poppins arrival the melody was later reused for a similar song in the happiest millionaire the pearly song  was not deleted per se but was instead incorporated into supercalifragilisticexpialidocious the compass sequence a precursor to jolly holiday was to be a multiplesong sequence a number of possible musical components have been identified south sea island symphony  chinese festival song  timbuctoo  – elements of this were reused for the chimpanzoo which was also cut tiki town  – the melody was reused for the chimpanzoo north pole polka  land of sand  – later rewritten as  trust in me  for the animated version of the jungle book the beautiful briny  – later used in bedknobs and broomsticks east is east  – another variation on the unused mary poppins melody deleted scores and music  editthe step in time sequence ends with the chimney sweeps being scattered by an onslaught of fireworks fired from admiral booms house in the final film the scene plays out with sound effects and no music the dvd release included the original version of the scene which was accompanied by a complex instrumental musical arrangement that combined step in time the admiral boom melody see above and a spoonful of sugar this musical arrangement can be heard on the films original soundtrack andrews recorded a brief reprise of chim chim cheree which was to have accompanied mary bert and the children as they marched across the rooftops of london an instrumental reprise of a spoonful of sugar was used as a march instead however andrews and dick van dyke can still be seen and heard singing a reprise of chim chim cheree in that sequence just before the other chimney sweeps appear for the step in time number the robin mary poppins whistles with in a spoonful of sugar originally sang a lyric as well andrews also recorded a brief yodel which breaks into the first line of a spoonful of sugar which was to have been used to activate the smoke staircase prior to the step in time number although cut from the film footage of andrews performing this exists and was included on the 2004 dvd the dvd also indicates that an alternate version of the yodel performed by dick van dyke may also exist release  editmary poppins premiered on august 27 1964 at graumans chinese theatre in los angeles 21 29 travers was not extended an invitation to the
