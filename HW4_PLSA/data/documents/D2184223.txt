know victory ― yuthura ban srcthe sith order was a sect of forcesensitives who utilized the dark side of the force the term sith originally referred to a species of alien native to the planets korriban and ziost who were later enslaved and ruled by exiled dark jedi from the galactic republic these dark jedi had once been members of the jedi order a monastic force religion dedicated to peace through the use of the light side of the force the dark jedi who refused to rely exclusively on the light side challenged the jedi by giving into the dark and starting the hundredyear darkness however they had been defeated and subsequently exiled from known space which led to their discovery of the sith species following centuries of interbreeding and mixing of cultures between the aliens and the exiles the sith would no longer be identified by their race but by their dedication to the ancient sith philosophy this religious order would survive in many different incarnations throughout galactic history the rise of a new leader or dark lord would often cause drastic reorganizations in the cult however the sith would always be characterized by their lust for power and their desire to destroy the jedi order  the sith were the most infamous of all dark side religions and the members of the cult were often seen as the pinnacle of power within the dark side throughout their long history the sith commanded several empires and initiated many galactic wars with such great influence the sith religion inspired many cults that werent technically part of the sith order nor did they consist of actual sith instead they were founded and made up of sith devotees and other forcesensitives dedicated to prolonging the teachings and the memory of the sith such cults included the naddists the

the force forged by fire edit edit if you seek to aid everyone that suffers in the galaxy you will only weaken yourself … and weaken them it is the internal struggles when fought and won on their own that yield the strongest rewards… if you care for others then dispense with pity and sacrifice and recognize the value in letting them fight their own battles ― darth traya srcdarth talon kills her master  the sith believed that conflict was the only true test of ones ability and so emphasized its importance it was their belief that conflict challenged both individuals and civilizations and so forced them to grow and evolve they believed that the avoidance of conflict–like the pacifist teachings of the jedi–resulted in stagnation and decline another purpose served by conflict was the elevation of the strong and the death of the weak by encouraging strife the strong were able to exercise their power while the weak were weeded from the ranks of the sith a core tenet to sith philosophy was selfreliance and the idea that an individual only deserved what they were strong enough to take likewise morality was treated as an obstacle to be overcome as it got in the way of a siths ability to recognize and seize opportunities for advancement and selfempowerment such philosophies were embraced and taught at sith academies where students were encouraged to challenge one another and fight for prestige that would be recognized by the headmaster of the academy at the academy on korriban during the jedi civil war students were tasked with gaining prestige so they might become one of the chosen few accepted into the ranks of darth malak s sith empire the strife to achieve prestige caused rivalries and animosity between the students as there were few tasks that offered prestige and many prospective sith similarly the students of the academy during the new sith wars were pitted against each other in dueling sessions atop the academy it was during these dueling sessions that intense rivalries were formed  rivalries that resulted in the deaths of students fohargh and sirak at the hands of darth bane  empowered by passion edit edit what fuels your power with the force but your passion the stronger darker emotions anger hatred fear… these passions empower us ―yuthura ban srcdarth vader choking his wife in anger cthe cornerstone of a siths power was emotion while the jedi taught that fear anger and pain were negative emotions to be overcome the sith believed that these strong emotions were natural and aided individuals in their survival by harnessing their emotions rather than suppressing them the sith believed they could achieve true power this belief was in stark contrast to that of the jedis who strived to place themselves beyond such base emotions indeed the sith saw passion as the only real way to fully understand the force however the sith believed strongly that the worthy could control their emotions and use them while the weak were ruled by them in accordance dark lady lumiya refused to accept jacen solo as a sith lord until he was able to control his anger instead of becoming a slave to it and freedon nadd renounced his faith in exar kun shortly before his destruction when he discovered the limitless ambition kun served however not all emotions were embraced by the sith they like the jedi considered love a dangerous emotion but for different reasons the jedi discouraged love because it led to attachment but the sith taught that love led to mercy which was anathema to them while darth sidious preyed on anakin skywalker s love for his wife in order to corrupt him he had no intention of allowing the relationship to survive skywalkers fall to the dark side darth bane had fallen in love with fellow sith pupil githany however he did not allow himself to retain any connections to her and did not regret her death on ruusan however this didnt stop some sith from taking lovers and allowing themselves to feel this emotion darth malgus for example had a lover eleena daru  the sithari edit edit in the original sith language the term  sithari  translated literally into lord or overlord over time however the term became closely associated with the idea of a perfect being who would rise to power and take control of the sith order the prophesied coming of the sithari was based around the notion that a perfect being would epitomize the teachings of the sith code and became free of all restrictions this being would lead the sith but also destroy them a destruction that would make the sith order stronger than before the identity of the sithari has been confirmed as darth bane who destroyed the brotherhood of darkness in order to remake the sith through the rule of two the prophesy of the sithari is very similar to the jedis prophesy of the chosen one  an extremely powerful forcesensitive who would lead their order to perfection guiding codes edit edit the code of the sith edit edit main article code of the sith peace is a lie there is only passion through passion i gain strength through strength i gain power through power i gain victory through victory my chains are broken the force shall free me ―the sith code srcthe code of the sith was the mantra which stated the core beliefs of the sith order and is believed to have been created in contrast to the jedi code the structure of the codes is almost identical and the initial line of the sith code directly contradicts the initial line of the jedi code which reads there is no emotion there is peace following the embrace of passion which was believed to be a powerful aspect of nature the code explains that the strength granted by passion leads to power which then leads to victory by way of victory the sith believed they could free themselves from the limitations of regular beings and achieve their potential neophyte sith believed that the breaking of chains represented the ability to do whatever one wished however more seasoned members of the order recognized that the true meaning of freedom was the end of all physical restrictions and the ability to attain perfection the sith believed that the only being who could truly live up to the code and attain freedom was the sithari and as such saw it as a guideline by which to live not a law to abide by the rule of two edit edit main article rule of two bane and zannah the first sith to embrace the rule of two c two there should be no more no less one to embody power the other to crave it ―darth bane srcthe rule of two was the principal upon which the order of the sith lords was founded it was created by darth bane a dark lord and member of the brotherhood of darkness bane believed that the sith had weakened themselves by accepting too many into their ranks and that the true dark side had abandoned them after studying the holocron of darth revan bane decided that the brotherhood needed to be destroyed and the sith rebuilt as a secretive order consisting of two beings—a single master and a single apprentice bane believed this philosophy would solve the infighting that had long been the bane of the sith order by allowing only two members into the cult at a time the dark side would remain concentrated within those two beings instead of legions of ineffective warriors when the apprentice learned all they could from the master it was their duty to kill the master and take an apprentice of their own in order to ensure the continuing strength of the cult as such the rule of two embraced the idea of the rule of the strong the small number of sith allowed the order to remain hidden for a millennium the rule of one edit edit main article rule of one darth krayt s vision for the one sith c wisely darth krayt has undone the mistake of bane therefore no rule of two limits the one sith today ― darth wyyrlok i srcthe rule of one was the guiding code of the one sith created by darth krayt after the collapse of the order of the sith lords it embraced the ideals of the ancient sith wherein there was a single dark lord of the sith who led many lesser sith lords along with other minions and acolytes the one represented the sith order itself a unified and cohesive group of sith who restrained from infighting and were fanatically obedient to dark lord krayt the practice of one apprentice per master was retained however there were many masters also retained was the practice of slaying a master once an apprentices training was complete however this was not done to continue the rule of the strong but rather to show ones faith and devotion to the sith cause the order was considered heretical by darth bane darth nihilus and darth andeddu who voiced their opinions via holocron some including darth nihl and cade skywalker believed that the lack of a line of succession would cause the one sith to collapse if darth krayt were ever killed though upon darth krayts final death control passed to darth nihl and the one sith continued to follow their lord loyally history edit edit origins edit edit the massassi were one of the two original sith subspecies c once we were mighty jedi of the republic

jedi order and the discovery of the dark side the sith species evolved on korriban the sith species began to coalesce as a society some time prior to roughly 100000 bby when their culture and religion developed early on they immersed their culture in rites and lore of the dark side coming together as a species they were able to fight off a killik incursion circa 30000 bby presumably resulting in an eventual killik sith lord taking up residence on alsakan although how this sith lord was able to break from the hivemind is unknown around 28000 bby legendary sith king adas ruled his people and their empire having ruled as a warlord for some time he was able to unite the peoples of korriban and was pronounced the sithari or overlord adass reign lasted for several centuries ending only after the invasion of korriban by the rakata of the infinite empire  initially friendly the rakata taught adas how to create holocrons and lent their knowledge of space travel to the sith however it soon became apparent that the rakata intended to take the sith people as slaves and adas launched a war to rid his world of them after driving them from korriban he hijacked several of their ships and used them to spread the sith species to ziost tund and malachor v and was eventually successful in driving the rakata from sith space entirely however the victory cost him his life the rakata left behind a star map on korriban and possibly the origin for the darth title the death of adas threw korriban into civil war with many different sith scrambling for power the world was devastated from the years of conflict and no new leader arose from the ashes one of the horrors of this war took place in 7000 bby when dathka graush destroyed most of the cities on korriban possibly resulting in the backwards primitive cultural regression of the sith species ultimately witnessed by the exiled dark jedi upon reaching korriban  source the sith people moved their center of government and culture to the world of ziost and left korriban with that planet becoming a tomb world for their fallen leaders a millennium prior to this in 8000 bby humans and aliens escaping the oppression of the tapani dynasty

in these discussions several individuals advocated the use of bogan what would become known as the dark side the followers of the light rejected this idea and defeated the followers of bogan in the force wars of tython  following the conflict the victors established the jedi order a group of warriormonks who followed the light side around 24500 bby a jedi named xendor accepted the teachings of the dark side and left the order along with many other students calling themselves the legions of lettow the resulting conflict known as the first great schism ended with xendor dead and the legions of lettow defeated the dark side would not have a strong hold until 7000 bby when another group of jedi left the order to follow the dark path these jedi had been delving into alternative uses for the force and became increasingly reliant on it they discovered that the force could twist life to serve their purposes and create new life these practices were looked upon with apprehension by other jedi as memories of the first schism were still present feeling their power was threatened the rogue jedi sought supporters within the order but were turned away arguments for their cause turned to conflicts and these jedi were exiled from the order taking their teachings with them they became known as dark jedi and launched a war against the jedi order that would come to be known as the hundredyear darkness  using alchemically altered soldiers and beasts the dark jedis war lasted a hundred years it was during this war that the leviathan was created along with many other monstrosities eventually the dark jedi were defeated at the battle of corbos as a result of infighting and jedi bombing as punishment the surviving dark jedi were gathered by republic forces and loaded aboard

traya srcthe exiles traveled the stars towards an unknown destination they emerged from hyperspace above korriban where they were greeted by the primitive sith people the exiles who included xo xaan ajunta pall and karness muur shocked the natives with their dark side abilities and were proclaimed jenjidai meaning dark jedi in the language of the sith the jenjidai forged an alliance with the sith rulers second in command and used that relationship to overthrow the king and claim dominion over the sith they adopted the title lords of the sith and their ruler came to be known as the jenari or dark lord of the sith  one of the first dark lords was the exile ajunta pall pall began remaking the sith empire into a new imperial regime lead by the sith lords instead of the kings of the sith people over time the jenjidai and the sith interbred to make the two groups indistinguishable from one another and the empire continued to be lead by a succession of dark lords including tulak hord deceased dark lords were entombed in the valley of the dark lords on korriban instead of the valley of golg as sith kings had been their tombs were filled with the treasures they had accumulated during their life as well as strong dark side energies often the tomb would also house the spirit of the dark lord himself who remained attached to his body and possessions through the force 3 the valley of the dark lords the final resting place for many dark lords during their reign the sith lords fought for power challenging one another with new and innovative weapons created through the dark side one such weapon was the muur talisman which was created by the sith lord and former dark jedi karness muur muur was an expert in sith alchemy and may have helped to create the leviathan during the hundredyear darkness his talisman had the power to transform humans into alchemically engineered monsters called rakghouls whom muur would be able to command when he discovered that aliens and forcesensitives were unaffected muur created the rakghoul plague which would spread his monsters to those immune to the talismans power eventually a rival sith lord dreypa created an oubliette which would contain muur his talisman and the plague muur was killed before he could be captured and his talisman was lost only to end up on taris several millennia later by unknown means eventually a legendary sith halfbreed named marka ragnos defeated sith council member simus in combat and rose to power claiming the title of dark lord of the sith his littledocumented but long reign was known to have been during the  golden age  of the sith empire during this time the empire experienced relative stability and encompassed at least 120 planets including arkania malachor v thule and vjun by this

ludo kressh to naga sadow srcthe golden age came to an abrupt halt with the death of marka ragnos control of the empire fell to the sith council which was divided over who should succeed ragnos as dark lord 4 ludo kressh and naga sadow duel during the funeral of marka ragnos  ctwo contenders rose to the forefront naga sadow and ludo kressh sadow was known as a progressive expansionist in contrast to kresshs reputation as a conservative protectionist originally confined to arguments and debates within the council the disagreement exploded violently during the funeral of marka ragnos the funeral procession was led by kressh with sadow conspicuously missing during the ceremonies much to kresshs chagrin sadow made his entrance in the middle of kresshs eulogy for the fallen dark lord the enraged kressh demanded sadow leave however his rival instead claimed the mantle of dark lord kressh responded by claiming the title as well and the two entered into a duel at the foot of ragnos tomb the fierce battle was interrupted by the ghost of marka ragnos who implored the two to stop fighting and pick their battles carefully for the sith empire he had helped build was in the balance following ragnos departure the two sith lords prepared to reenter combat however they were once again interrupted this time by the arrival of wayward hyperspace explorers gav and jori daragon the sibling explorers claimed to hail from the galactic republic and were quickly taken into custody and imprisoned on the sith capital world of ziost setting aside their conflict for a time kressh and sadow rejoined the council which was debating the fate of the daragons unsurprisingly the two disagreed on this as well kressh under the belief that they were harbingers of a republic invasion called for their immediate execution while sadow saw them as a pathway to expansion by way of conquering their republic the council was yet again split between the two however ludo kressh was able to win with the support of the council majority simus a former contender for the title of dark lord and ally of naga sadows went to inform the daragons of their impending execution however naga sadow had no intention of following the will of the council and killed simus with weapons confiscated from the daragons ship the starbreaker 12 making it appear as though it was a republic attack he freed the daragons and hid them away in his fortress on khar shian while reporting simus death back to the council feigning shock he claimed that the apparent republic aggression and rescue of the daragons required retaliation something he had foreseen the council almost unanimously elected him dark lord with the exception of kressh who claimed the title for himself and stormed out of the meeting shortly afterwards sadow staged yet another republic attack by stealing the starbreaker 12 from impound on ziost he would need the ship to return jori daragon to the republic thereby leading the dark lord to his next frontier the human female was being kept in sadows decoy fortress on khar delba while her brother remained on khar shian to be trained in the ways of the dark side by sadow 5 sadow in exile on yavin 4 cin the process sadow hoped to rid the empire of kressh and so planted evidence on ziost that would point to back to himself kressh acted predictably and attacked sadows decoy fortress on khar delba sadow had prepared for the battle and stationed his fleet on the dark side of the moon khar shian he attacked an unsuspecting kressh whose commanders were betrayed by their crews kressh knowing he could not win the battle  staged his own death and fled leaving naga sadow as the undisputed ruler of the sith during the battle he allowed jori daragon to escape with the starbreaker 12 which was wired with a homing beacon in his first act as dark lord sadow gathered his forces for an invasion of the republic initiating a conflict known as the great hyperspace war sadow even used sith lords as generals in his powerful army including garu and shar dakhan the republic unwilling to believe jori daragons story of impending war was unprepared for the onslaught and was initially overwhelmed by the invasion sadows warships and warriors spread throughout republic space attacking many worlds simultaneously while sadow himself aided by using battle meditation from within his sith meditation sphere stationed above the star primus goluud along with his flagship sadow presented the republic with a seemingly unbeatable enemy empress teta of koros major was the only republic official prepared for the assault and her forces beat back sith attacks on cinnagar and kirrek and were able to pursue them back to primus goluud where sadow activated a superweapon within his flagship the corsair that caused the star to supernova the explosion killed gav daragon and forced the sith to retreat back to their empire with tetas forces in pursuit returning to korriban in defeat sadows forces were met with those of ludo kressh after feigning his demise kressh had remained within the empire gaining support while sadow lead the invasion of the republic the two fleets clashed initiating the first battle of korriban when it appeared kressh would win the battle against sadows already wounded forces the dark lord ordered that one of his vessels ram kresshs flag ship the impact killed the rival sith lord and ended the battle sadows final conflict with ludo kressh sadow was unable to enjoy his victory however as empress tetas forces emerged from hyperspace moments later crippling sadows ship and decimating his forces hoping to escape to yavin sadow fled the battle and was believed killed in the denarii nova he created with the corsair as the remains of the sith empire crumbled behind him sadow and his remaining massassi warriors landed on yavin 4 where construction began on mountainous temples dedicated to the dark lord with the republic navy entering sith space the sith became desperate shar dakhan as acting dark lord of the sith ordered his massassi pilots to ram invading republic ships this drove the republic back for a while however the republics triumph was inevitable they destroyed most of the sith empire however this was not the end of the empire various sith survivors fled to different parts of the galaxy several sith fled to thule where they would remain for generations waiting for their revenge on the jedi and the republic they established a military dictatorship ruled by an oligarchy of eight generals several of the remaining sith lords sought refuge on ambria where they hid among the planets dark side energies in order to avoid persecution they stayed on the planet for many years until passing into the force themselves leaving yet more dark side spirits on ambria on kesh the descendants of a crashed ship the omen survived and formed the lost tribe of sith several sith sects survived on vjun and passed on their teachings secretly through the families on tund the sith refugees eventually became mere charletons known as the sorcerers of tund as a result of an unstable hyperdrive the sith starship harbinger traveled to the future to the year 41 aby finally one sith lord took his forces and retreated to the unknown regions where they would bide their time and wait this hidden sith empire still held on to malachor v

nadd impressed his masters with his connection to the force and eagerness to find harmony the attention from his masters caused arrogance in nadd that lead him to believe he would soon be elevated to knighthood to his surprise he was passed over for knighthood causing him to become resentful and conflicted nadd sought out jedi master matta tremayne in the hopes that she might be able to show him what he must do in order to become a knight in a test for the young jedi tremayne ignored him until his anger burst out and he turned to leave only then did she acknowledge him challenging him to a

freedons saber cut through tremayne killing her initially regretful nadd soon became infuriated as he began to believe it was all a ploy to get him removed from the order abandoning the jedi he fled ossus craving revenge nadd first traveled to the heart of the now defunct sith empire in the hopes that the dark side teachings there would lead him to the revenge he desired he arrived on the world of ashas ree where the ancient sith lord garu had hidden the holocron of king adas learning from the holocron nadd studied deeper into the dark side and traveled deeper into old sith space eventually the he came upon the fourth moon of yavin and the sleeping dark lord naga sadow sadow finally recognizing nadd as one who could restore the power of the sith awakened and consented to train the fallen jedi in the ways of the sith the training lasted for a time however before it was complete nadds confidence in his own abilities once again took control believing himself strong enough for the title

beasts of the jungle which the people of iziz had fought for centuries nadd arrived on the planet and wowed the populace with his dark side magic and force powers much like the exiled dark jedi millennia before on korriban nadd proclaimed himself the ruler of the people in iziz and king of onderon izizs law and order was based on the policy of banishing dissidents and criminals from the walled city condemning them to death by the animals of onderon eventually the banished criminals organized themselves into the  beast riders  after taming the beasts of the jungle such as the drexl cannok and boma the riders continually attacked the city they had once called home in a centurieslong conflict known as the beast wars nadd was able to elevate himself to a neargod status with the people by repelling attacks by the riders by use of the force although his reign was oppressive the onderonians accepted his teachings and embraced his dark side influence nadd eventually died and was

and amanoa following his tenure as ommins personal aide eventually freedon nadd came to realize that neither the king nor the queen would be fit to serve as the agent of his resurrection ommin had become far too weak under the pall of the dark side and amanoa was no longer focused on the sith unwilling to surrender nadd attempted one last time to pull the queen back into the grip of the sith appearing before her and warning her not to allow the still ongoing beast wars to fully erupt as it would result in her destruction although nadd hoped this would scare the queen back into her dark

peacefully having no interest in a peaceful settlement the enraged queen revealed her dark side allegiance to her enemies surrounding iziz in a palpable darkness during the ensuing battle the naddist army fought to defend the queen as she retreated to freedon nadds tomb beneath the palace the naddists fought valiantly against the beast riders for a time under amanoas dark side influence however the arrival of master arca jeth broke their advantage jeth was able to follow the queen into the dark lords tomb and dispel his dark energy killing queen amanoa in the process 9 freedon nadds spirit guides aleema and satal keto to safety cthe death of the queen and the supposed dispersion of nadds dark energy did little to pull onderon out of darkness however even after galia took the throne and the fighting ended there was still a noticeable dark side aura throughout iziz the decision was made by the jedi to exhume the remains of freedon nadd and bury both him and queen amanoa on onderons jungle moon of dxun where their presence could no longer corrupt future rulers news of his wifes death at the hands of the jedi and the end of the beast wars eventually reached king ommin still hiding beneath iziz prepared to reveal himself once more the frail king had the dark side slave warb null lead the naddist cult into battle on the streets of iziz during the queens funeral procession the darksiders tunneled up into the surface of the city and ambushed the jedi null fought them off and the naddists captured the sarcophagi of both deceased monarchs quickly returning them to ommins underground sanctuary shortly after the battle ommin empowered by the spirit of freedon nadd distracted arca jeth long enough for the king to seize the jedi master and flee with him deep into the tunnels jeths padawan ulic qeldroma was unable to save his master from abduction as he had entered a duel with warb null the duel ended quickly however with null dead meanwhile on koros major satal and aleema keto cousins and royal heirs of the tetan monarchy had formed the krath secret society with their friends the group researched the sith and their ancient empire which instigated the great hyperspace war centuries before and became so consumed with the history that the two decided to take a trip to coruscant where the galactic museum had prepared an exhibit featuring artifacts from the sith empire at the behest of aleema satal stole a sith spellbook from the exhibit the dark lords of the sith however neither of the two could read the contents as it was written in ancient sith glyphs as the fighting continued on onderon for days word of the conflict spread across the galaxy via the holo net a report of the sithworshipping dark side army was read on a newscast which caught the attention of the cousins the two resolved to travel to onderon in search of an individual who could translate the text for them 10 the final resting place of freedon nadd on dxun calthough the battle on onderon was progressing well for the naddists the jedi soon received reinforcements in the form of a republic battle group and five additional jedi from ossus one of these jedi nomi sunrider was able to turn the tide with her battle meditation ability the fighting which had been confined to the jungle stronghold of the beast riders for two days now returned to iziz as the streets once again became embroiled in war the keto cousins dropped out of hyperspace right in the middle of the war zone ignoring warnings from the republic fleet in orbit the two descended towards the city and were shot down by crossfire aleema and satal survived the crash and were able to contact king ommin he gifted the aspiring darksiders with a sith amulet which granted them the power to read the sith spellbook in return he asked for the opportunity to transcribe the spellbook for his own collection as the trio completed their deal ommin introduced the ketos to his latest addition to his collection arca jeth ommin planned to torture the jedi master enough that he would be unable to resist the temptation of the dark side however it was at this moment that the jedi task force in the city was able to penetrate ommins stronghold and ambush his defenders as satal and aleema panicked and fled deeper into the tunnels beneath iziz the king fought the jedi but to no avail ulic qeldroma was able to slice through ommins exoskeleton incapacitating him the king begged for the assistance of freedon nadd however the dark lord had decided that the ketos showed more promise than ommin nadds spirit guided the two krath founders to safety and returned to tell ommin that he had forsaken him and the jedi that their victory would be shortlived before departing iziz nadd prophesized on the fate of ulic qeldroma claiming he was destined to become one of the great sith lords with ommins death and the end of the freedon nadd uprising onderon was finally free of nadds dark shadow the bodies of king ommin queen amanoa and freedon nadd were all moved to dxun into a tomb of mandalorian iron not to be disturbed again aleema and satal armed with new knowledge and artifacts from iziz returned to

bring down the galaxy ― exar kun to ulic qeldroma srcwith the naddist revolt crushed freedon nadds dream of a second sith golden age was halted once again however a new opportunity would present itself in the form of the rising krath cult in the empress teta system and the young jedi exar kun  exar kun was the pupil of krevaaki jedi master vodosiosk baas along with the cathar jedi crado and sylvar kun was extremely talented in the force and much like freedon nadd centuries earlier developed an arrogance that lead him to believe he was worthy of receiving special teachings becoming engrossed with the idea that he could research sith teachings and powers yet remain uncorrupted by the dark side kun began to delve into forbidden sith holocrons on the jedi world of dantooine during a lightsaber training session with his master and fellow students kun defeated crado easily following crados defeat master baas instructed sylvar to enter a duel with kun exar taunted sylvar with claims that nonhumans were inept and unworthy angering her and in retribution she struck the human with her claws scarring and infuriating him kun attacked her viciously and nearly killed her when vodosiosk baas stepped in and stopped kuns saber with his walking staff in an attempt to teach exar kun a lesson in strength baas challenged his wayward apprentice to a duel and gained the upper hand quickly despite the immense odds of walking stick versus lightsaber kun was able to defeat his master with aid from crado who threw exar his lightsaber during the duel victorious kun declared himself a jedi knight and departed dantooine to search for the secrets of the sith 11 satal and aleemas krath forces overwhelm the empress teta system during their coup  ckun followed his curiosity to onderon where the fighting had just ended he learned here that the sith lord freedon nadd had recently been interred on dxun and traveled to the moon in search of answers kun broke into the sealed tomb and encountered the spirit of nadd who encouraged the young man to continue his search on the ancient sith burial world of korriban as kun left dxun for old sith space aleema and satal keto who had also recently paid onderon a visit were setting their plan for domination in motion on koros major the two krath founders after having used the late king ommins artifacts and the spirit of freedon nadd to become adept in sith sorcery traveled to an orbital carbonite smelting plant above koros where lord keto and lady magda keto rulers of the empress teta system and parents of satal and aleema were being given a tour the two were escorted by the royal tutor korus whose tongue was transformed into an adegan eel by the children this bewildered lord keto who attempted to call for help but his guards swords were transformed into snakes that began to attack their wielders helpless lord and lady keto accepted defeat at the hands of their children and continued their tour now guiding the new emperor satal and empress aleema of the teta system the group entered a smelting chamber and the new rulers of teta had the former rulers tied above vats of molten carbonite and lowered into them with lord and lady keto dead and the tetan government under their control satal and aleema took up residence in the iron citadel in cinnagar the worlds of empress teta quickly fell in line behind the krath all except for koros major itself initiating the krath holy crusade the ketos launched an assault against their own capital world hoping to bring it in line the krath holy crusade edit edit ill bet they dont even understand what theyve unleashed and that makes them all the more dangerous ― cay qeldroma srcas the ketos prepared to crush the resistance on koros major word of the struggle and krath usurpation reached the republic capital of coruscant jedi master arca jeth petitioned the republic leadership to send aid to the resistance fighters and help defeat the krath as the dark side cult reminded the jedi too much of the naddists recently defeated on onderon 12 aleema keto s illusions attack the republic navy at the first battle of empress teta  the republic complied and a battle group to relieve the resistance fighters was organized lead by jedi knights nomi sunrider and ulic qeldroma however when the republic fleet arrived at koros major the battle was already in progress with krath warships attacking the planet as qeldroma ordered his ships into battle positions aleema and satal began their counterattack aleema utilized sith magic to conjure illusions of space grazers which headed directly at the republic fleet causing the officers to panic and their ships to scatter nomi sunrider was able to see through the illusion and refocus the fleet however the krath decided that the battle would require both the force and physical military might and so ordered wings of chaos fighters to initiate suicide runs on the republic vessels as the fighters closed the distance between the fleets aleema conjured an illusion of additional wings of chaos fighters to confuse and overwhelm the republic ships sunrider again saw through the illusion and was able to block aleemas ghost ships from interfering in the battle but there were still many real fighters that collided with republic vessels the republic fleet was crippled and forced to retreat with a severely injured qeldroma while the krath were left to complete their conquest of koros the battle of empress teta was a complete success for the krath and marked the beginning of the wider great sith war  because of the massive losses over koros major the jedi leadership decided it was time for an assembly to be called in order to discuss the krath threat and other gathering shadows krath intelligence agents discovered that the grand convocation was to be held on deneba and satal planned for a direct assault against the jedi there as thousands of jedi vessels descended upon deneba satal was able to sneak a krath warship among them hiding in orbit meanwhile light years away on korriban exar kun was exploring the planet once inhabited by the dark lords of the sith guided by freedon nadds spirit kun became trapped and injured beneath rubble during a cavein within an ancient tomb the cavein was designed by nadd as a test for kun who would need to touch the dark side in order to survive initially fearful kun reached out through the force for his former master baas on deneba who attempted to help his pupil freedon nadd refused to allow this to happen however and blocked vodos attempts at aiding kun near death and running out of options kun embraced the dark side and freed himself 13 a krath war droid on deneba ckuns anger and malice healed his broken body and sent ripples through the force that greatly disturbed the jedi assembly however baas accepted that he could no longer help the young man kun still under the belief he could use both the dark and light side without consequence left korriban on a course for yavin 4 where nadd claimed his training would be completed on deneba the jedi debated over how to best combat the dark side and its followers and after hearing proposals and arguments from ulic qeldroma and others the convocation took a short recess just before the conclave could resume satal set his plan in motion the krath warship in orbit above the planet launched a large number of escape pods each filled with krath war droids catching the jedi unaware the droids were able to kill many of them in the initial stages of the attack in conjunction with the war droid assault the service droids who had been serving the jedi during the convocation also attacked their masters having been sabotaged by krath spies prior to the arrival of the jedi although all the droids were destroyed at the battle of deneba many jedi were killed including arca jeth the death of his master caused ulic qeldroma to plan a mission to destroy the krath from within a strategy frowned upon by many other jedi including his late master ulic traveled to the empress teta system and cut off contact with the rest of the order he was quickly able to convince aleema that he had fallen from the jedi way and become sympathetic to the krath however satal was not so trusting he had the young jedi imprisoned and tortured which caused ulic to begin a journey towards the dark side satal eventually came to trust ulic and qeldroma was instated as a warlord of the krath fearing the worst after months with no contact ulics lover nomi sunrider planned a mission to rescue ulic from cinnagar whe she arrived however she found that ulic still wished to maintain his cover and did nothing as nomi was sentenced to death he attempted to explain himself to her via a secret message that was intercepted by satal not knowing ulics plan nomi escaped her prison but before she could depart she was confronted by satal who was then confronted by ulic qeldroma ulic had recently learned from aleema that it was satal who ordered the attack on deneba and in search of revenge for the late arca jeth ulic attacked satal during the ensuing struggle ulic killed satal in a fit of anger and succumbed to the dark side ketos intent from the start although nomi and other jedi attempted to help him he attacked them as well and drove them off while he stayed on koros major ulic soon took satals place at aleemas side was awarded with a rare sith amulet while nomi began to plan yet another mission to rescue ulic 14 some crimes deserve the justice of hatred  ulic qeldroma exacts revenge on satal keto across the galaxy exar kun was also continuing his descent into darkness much like ulic who believed he could conquer the dark side from within yet still remain true to the light exar believed he could use the power of the dark yet remain uncorrupted by it freedon nadd whose spirit still guided kun was intent on proving him wrong as kun arrived on yavin 4 he was confronted by the primitive and savage massassi people who easily captured the dark jedi as exar was still unwilling to fully give into the power of the dark side on the verge of death kun was again visited by freedon nadd nadd once again told him that the only way to survive was to embrace the dark side and exar complied seizing a sith amulet from a massassi priest and using its power to free himself and kill his captors exar had fully accepted the sith ways much to freedon nadds delight who immediately demanded that kun get to work on the creation of a new body for the longdead dark lord to inhabit a task both ommin and amanoa had failed on onderon exar had grown annoyed with nadd however and used his newfound power to destroy his spirit once and for all in his last moments nadd visited ulic qeldroma and aleema keto in cinnagar and warned them of kuns rising power freedon nadd plague of the jedi and father to the naddists and krath was gone exar kun free from nadds command went about enslaving the remaining massassi on yavin 4 and searching for threats to his power he identified two darksiders on koros major ulic and aleema and set out to kill them kun arrived in cinnagar directly after a jedi assault lead by nomi sunrider was beaten back by qeldroma exar confronted ulic and aleema and quickly incapacitated the tetan empress qeldroma was much more of a challenge however and the two dark jedi dueled fiercely the duel was shortlived though as exar and ulics sith amulets began to glow with dark energy enticing the spirit of marka ragnos to appear as it had during the duel between naga sadow and ludo kressh this time however the combatants yielded to the spirit and stopped their duel to heed ragnoss words the ancient sith lord proclaimed that exar kun was to be the new dark lord of the sith while ulic qeldoma was to become his apprentice the two were branded with sith tattoos on their foreheads to signify their new allegiance with the inception of the new sith lords the order was once again revived the first time since the death of freedon nadd centuries before the brotherhood of the sith edit edit jedi master odanurr s death at the hands of exar kun the new dark lord of the sith c you are puppets of a tradition pretending to be important the coming of a golden age has no place for you your republic is an empty selfindulgent diversion…signifying nothing the lost glory of the sith will turn all of your supposed accomplishments to dust ―ulic qeldroma to the senate srcallied with aleeemas krath armies the two sith lords set out to plan the final destruction of the jedi and the republic using the dark reaper they inflicted neargenocidal casualties on worlds such as raxus prime exar used sith alchemy to create terentateks large creatures with a thirst for jedi blood ulic was also able to make an alliance with mandalore the indomitable on kuar and with the new addition of mandalorian soldiers to their forces the sith overwhelmed the republic defenders at foerost while the krath and mandalorian armies under ulics command terrorized the galaxy exar went about building a following of darksiders for the sith lords to command he traveled to ossus where he gave an impassioned speech to the jedi students there claiming their masters were withholding knowledge and power from them many students including crado left ossus for yavin 4 where they would become the apprentices of kun however before kun himself left he planned on retrieving the sith holocron possessed by odanurr the ancient jedi hero of the great hyperspace war kun confronted odanurr and killed him taking the holocron for himself and claiming the ancient master declared exar a jedi master directly before his death on yavin 4 his students expressed doubt about the path they had started on after sensing the dark taint of the moon in response kun destroyed odanurrs sith holocron releasing the spirits trapped inside which then possessed the doubtful jedi reassured by the dark spirits now controlling their actions the jedi students trained with kun in the dark arts and were eventually convinced by him that the last thing standing in the way of another sith golden age was their former jedi masters the students left yavin to hunt down and kill their masters in an incredibly successful strike known as the jedi pogrom meanwhile ulic had grown ambitious and arrogant with his new mandalorian army and decided to strike the heart of the republic coruscant although the plan was frowned upon by kun ulic went ahead with the attack and lead mandalore and aleema into battle alongside their armies aleema tired of sharing power over the krath with ulic ordered a retreat while qeldroma was attacking the republic war room alone abandoned ulic was eventually defeated by the jedi on coruscant and put on trial 15 exar kun shortly before killing his former master vodosiosk baas ulics trial was presided over by the republic inquisition and he was found guilty on all charges as he was sentenced to death exar kun strode into the senate hall where the trial was being held immobilizing the senators and executing the supreme chancellor kun freed his apprentice only to be confronted by his former master vodosiosk baas kun used his new weapon a doublebladed lightsaber to overpower and murder baas who claimed he would one day return to defeat his apprentice kun and qeldroma departed coruscant to continue their war after again proclaiming the dominance of the sith upon ulics return to command mandalore informed him of aleemas treachery at the battle of coruscant and the sith apprentice began planning for revenge the next stage of the war centered around the attack on kemplex ix ulic hoped to use the battle as a trap for aleema while exar planned to trick the krath sorceress into destroying the cron cluster a group of ten closely packed stars which would result in the destruction of a different target exar armed aleema with the corsair the ancient flagship of naga sadow discovered on yavin 4 kun taught her how to use its sith magic to rip the cores from stars but neglected to tell her that it would cause a supernova the ship could not protect her from aleema and crado were to take the ship and lead the assault on kemplex ix however aleema was overly eager to use her new weapon after destroying the republic jumpstation that was their target aleema lured a jedi fleet into the nearby cron cluster just as exar kun had predicted aleema ripped the core out of one of the stars incinerating the jedi fleet however she was unable to control the explosion a chain reaction began with all ten stars going nova and destroying the corsair along with aleema and crado also according to exar kuns plan the supernova headed directly at ossus the primary target of the sith while the jedi attempted to evacuate ossus with as many relics and artifacts as they could exar kun and ulic lead an attack against the planet kuns massassi warriors looted

kills his jedi brother cay qeldroma on ossus kun failed as bnar transformed into a giant tree and hid the lightsabers beneath his body not to be disturbed again until millennia later ulic flew above the fray during the battle only to be confronted by his brother cay qeldroma who had sensed his presence ulic and cay landed and began a duel which ended with ulic killing the brother he had once fought alongside as a jedi witnessing the murder nomi sunrider trapped ulic in a wall of light and cut him off from the force out of disgust for what he had become ulic only now realized what he had done and renounced his sith ties agreeing to help the jedi defeat the dark lord exar kun after both the jedi and sith retreated from the planet ossus was hit by the cron supernova destroying all life on the planet save for master bnar on other battlefields across the galaxy the war still raged following the jedi victory at the battle of toprawa the failed jedi apprentice haazen was nearly killed by explosions in caverns that claimed the life of many of his fellow jedi including barrison draay haazen was revived by the sith and turned to the dark side only to hide his allegiances following the end of the war on onderon the remaining mandalorian warriors were beaten back and retreated to dxun where mandalore the indomitable was killed by wild animals with ulics help the jedi also prepared for a massive assault on kuns fortress on yavin 4 the war was drawing to a close and exar kun was the last leader of the sith still standing above yavin thousands of jedi ships descended towards kuns fortress realizing the war was lost kun assembled his massassi warriors at the temples left behind by naga sadow exar kun called upon sith magic and drained his massassi slaves of their life force killing them the energy he gained from them allowed the dark lord to break free of his mortal body and maintain his spirit which hoped to leave yavin to continue the war elsewhere in the galaxy sensing this nomi and rest of the assembled jedi created a wall of light around yavin 4 hoping it would have the same effect as it did against ulic on ossus the massive surge of light side energy managed to keep exar kuns spirit trapped on the planet tied to one of his temples however the collision of light energy from the jedi and dark from kuns sith magic caused a massive firestorm to erupt and rage across the moon killing all life on its surface the jedi retreated their mission accomplished the great sith war was over and the sith order was defeated following the conclusion of the great sith war the remains of the brotherhood of the sith were disbanded the empress teta system was finally liberated from the remnants of the krath at the third battle of empress teta and the jedi and republic began the long process of rebuilding a broken galaxy during this period the jedi initiated the great hunt an effort to kill the exar kuns remaining tarentateks which terrorized the order during the war the program was mostly successful however several beasts survived on both korriban and kashyyyk the jedi also attempted to destroy the sithinspired mecrosa order however their attempts were unseccessful the few surviving members of the brotherhood were still scattered throughout the galaxy toki tollivar became a serial killer on corellia haazen infiltrated the jedi covenant an organization designed to ensure the extiction of the sith and ulic qeldroma was killed shortly after his redemption on rhen var the old sith empire continued to survive in obscurity in the unknown regions still lead by the same sith lord who had escaped the empires destruction centuries before during the great hyperspace war surviving influences edit edit haazen sith acolyte in hiding c the sith came to us with an offer–to fight a worthy enemy in a battle that would be remembered forever ― canderous ordo srcthe remnants of the ancient sith empire saw an opportunity for revenge in the form of the mandalorians after mandalore the indomitable s death on dxun during the war mandalore the ultimate rose to take his place as leader of the mandalorian clans this new mandalore reformed his warriors into the neocrusaders and made a base on the moon of dxun according to canderous ordo mandalore was approached by the sith and goaded into attacking the republic as it was weak and still rebuilding in the aftermath of the great sith war mandalore accepted and readied his armies for war and in 3976 bby twenty years after the conclusion of the great sith war the mandalorians began a brutal campaign for dominance over the outer rim and areas of unknown regions the neocrusaders were able to carve out an area of space for themselves that exceeded that of the hutt empire however the republic refused to respond to the threat until the mandalorians neared the business world of taris at which point the galactic senate pledged its support to the defense of taris a defense lead by admiral saul karath a militarysecurity cordon was established and the battle entered into an uneasy period of tension while the republic leapt headlong into the conflict the jedi remained cautious the high council decided it would not aid the republic turning the sentiment of much of the republic army against them during this period the jedi covenants first watch circle a group of jedi consulars based on taris received a force vision depicting the return of the sith the jedi covenants purpose was to prevent this specific event from happening thereby avoiding yet another great sith war in response these jedi consulars massacred their students karness muur and his talisman c who they believed to be the source of the future sith menace zayne carrick padawan to lucien draay was the only one of the five students to survive the first watch circle and the jedi covenant framed carrick for the massacre claiming he had turned to the dark side in reality all of these events were being engineered by haazen the sith acolyte still in hiding within the jedi covenant since the conclusion of the war haazen had been draays jedi master and since his grievous injuries and turn to the dark side during the war he had been plotting to destroy the jedi order from within by wresting control of the covenant away from luciens mother krynda draay  as the jedi hunted for carrick he and covenant shadow celeste morne encountered the muur talisman on taris the ancient relic of the original sith empire had somehow made its way to the cityplanet where the rakghoul plague that had been created by karness muur several millennia before ran rampant shortly after the two jedi discovered it the talisman was taken to jebble by invading mandalorian forces there it transformed an entire mandalorian army into rakghouls that threatened to leave the planet and spread the disease throughout the galaxy morne and carrick also discovered that the talisman still contained the spirit of karness muur himself who hoped to possess a forcesensitive body and create a new sith era enforced by his rakghouls celeste morne who had dedicated her life to the prevention of the return of the sith allowed the talisman to attach itself to her she was able to control muur to some degree however she was corrupted as well and was in danger of slipping to the dark side carrick and morne discovered another sith artifact on jebble that had been acquired by the mandalorians— dreypas oubliette the oubliette was designed to contain both muur and the plague however morne would have to be interred within it as well carrick planned to leave and return with help for her however shortly after his departure the mandalorian fleet arrived and bombarded the planet with nuclear warheads killing the rakghouls and flooding the oncefrozen world carrick believed morne to be dead however she was safely in stasis within the intact oubliette and would remain there for almost four millennia zayne carrick traveled to coruscant shortly after hoping to force a member of the first watch circle to confess to their crime and clear zaynes name master xamar gave in and confessed to the jedi council which then ordered an assault on the draay estate headquarters of the covenant having already poisoned krynda haazen set his plan into motion initiating  vindication  a contingency plan that was to be put into effect had the jedi council come under the influence of the sith vindication placed the orbiting republic fleet in haazens control allowing him to kill many of the attacking jedi with orbital bombardment carrick and lucien draay were the only two jedi not forced to retreat and although haazen nearly pulled draay to the dark side the jedi refused to join the sith and instead killed haazen by redirecting the republic ships to fire directly at the draay estate both carrick and draay survived however neither returned to the jedi order deciding to take different paths carrick and his friends later killed toki tollivar another sith acolyte who had been in hiding since the conclusion of the war 17 revan alek and several revanchists on cathar the making of revan edit  well go to the front—and beyond it if itll save the galaxy sometimes you have to enter the darkness to save the light ― alek squinquargesimus on the revanchists srcas the tension in the outer rim continued to escalate several members of the jedi order began to voice their opposition to the councils decision to remain uninvolved foremost among these dissidents was the jedi knight revan he along with his close friend alek squinquargesimus began to advocate for the jedi to enter the war alongside the republic although many jedi remained loyal to the councils choice many younger jedi joined revan and alek and soon began to scout the front lines revans followers soon adopted the  revanchists  as these renegades probed the borders between mandalorian and republic space taris descended into chaos following the padawan massacre and the departure of the jedi masters stationed there seeing his opportunity to seize the planet mandalore the ultimate initiated the true mandalorian war with his armada pouring into republic space and overwhelming the underprepared security forces the republic suffered grievous losses in battles at onderon vanquo several outer rim colonies taris and serroco  seeing the carnage revan hoped to gain more support for his efforts and so released records of the genocide of cathar a mandalorian operation that had occurred in the early stages of the war during the councils refusal to take part in the conflict the reports shocked both the republic and the jedi leading to more support for both revan and alek who had adopted the alias malak since the events surrounding vindication the two led the revanchists also known as the jedi crusaders to join the republic military and fight in battles across the galaxy revan and malak alongside a female jedi crusader proved to be capable military commanders and quickly rose through the ranks eventually gaining control over a full third of the republic navy the soldiers under their command became incredibly loyal to the jedi and increasingly averse to the council and knights who chose to remain out of the war as revan and malak continued their crusade the tide began to turn in their favor the mandalorian armies were beaten back on taris and crushed at dxun  18 the trayus academy on malachor v revan and malaks tactics became increasingly brutal during the fighting having sacrificed countless republic soldiers on dxun simply to drive the mandalorians off the moon and decimating mandalorian ground forces on althir soon the mandalorians had retreated to their prewar empire in the unknown regions pursued by revans forces revan was a hero to the republic and the jedi and appeared to have been vindicated in his defiance of the council however appearances were deceiving early in the war during revans original scouting of the area surrounding mandalorian space he came upon malachor v a forbidden taboo world to the mandalorians by this time the hidden empire had forgotten the world the jedi traveled to the planets surface and was immediately overwhelmed by dark side energies malachor had once belonged to the ancient sith empire and was saturated with the dark side in an effort to save himself from being consumed by the dark side revan fed off of it instead on malachor he also stumbled upon the trayus academy and ancient repository of sith teachings built around a dark side geyser it was there that he learned the location of korriban and the existence of a hidden sith empire the faction of the original empire that had survived the great hyperspace war and been in hiding beyond the unknown regions for thousands of years revan believing these sith to be a greater evil than the mandalorians accepted the sith way and the power it offered in the hopes that he could defend the galaxy from this newly discovered threat he also believed that these sith had somehow influenced the mandalorians into attacking the republic revan also introduced malak to the teaching of the sith and together the two adopted the title of sith lords with revan as the dark lord and malak as the apprentice they remade themselves into darth revan and darth malak marking the first recorded use of the honorific darth title during the war revan also discovered a star map on kashyyyk  an ancient relic of the infinite empire which had attempted to conquer the original sith people far before the creation of the sith religious order the star map hinted at the existence of an ancient superweapon that revan would focus on finding after the war the new sith made preparations for the final battle of the mandalorian wars and their forces in the aftermath of the conflict sith teachings began to spread through the republic fleet however it was largely unquestioned as revan and malak were still the heroes of the republic the new dark lord decided to use malachor v as the final battleground positioning a fleet of republic ships in orbit that consisted of crewmen and soldiers who were not fanatically loyal to him the mandalorians temptation for battle eclipsed their desire to avoid malachor and so began a final massive assault on the republic fleet which was being lead by the female jedi crusader who had served alongside revan and malak for the duration of the war prior to the battle revan had entrusted her with the mass shadow generator a new superweapon designed by the zabrak engineer baodur as the battle began the republic forces were overwhelmed and suffered crippling losses however revan soon arrived with reinforcements and the power of sith teachings 19 the ruins of malachor v he drew upon the dark energy of the planet below invigorating his forces and drawing many of them to the dark side revan himself killed mandalore the ultimate and the remaining mandalorian forces were pushed towards malachor at this point the jedi crusader leading the fleet ordered the activation of the mass shadow generator and watched in horror as thousands of ships from both the mandalorian and republic fleets were crushed in an artificial gravity well the wreckage slammed into the planet and ruptured its crust leaving nothing but a broken core the countless deaths could be felt through the force however the jedi crusader cut herself off from the force before the echoes could kill her the battle ended with almost all of the mandalorians killed and the remaining declaring their unconditional surrender to revan who disbanded the warriors and sentenced them to perpetual exile the surviving jedi were either turned to the dark side or killed by revan and malak however the dark lord allowed the nowforcedead jedi crusader to escape and return to the jedi council on coruscant where she would be sentenced to exile for her actions during the war revan had singlehandedly defeated the mandalorian menace and could have returned to coruscant to be hailed as a hero despite the tragedy over malachor v to everybodys surprise however both he and malak along with a full third of the republic fleet disappeared into the unknown regions shortly after the battle of malachor the official reason was that they were hunting down the last of the mandalorians however the sith lords and their fleet were actually searching the galaxy for the star forge the ancient weapon that revan had learned about from the star map several years passed with the republic receiving no word from the missing fleet and it was assumed that the heroes of the mandalorian wars were dead the jedi civil war and the redemption of darth revan edit edit revan and malak confront the sith emperor in the unknown regions  the hero had become a conqueror ― jedi master dorak srchowever revan and malak were very much alive during their time in the unknown regions they encountered a sith empire established by the sith emperor confronting the dark lord they were turned to the dark side and recruited these two new sith lords were dispatched back into republic space to locate the star forge allowing the empire to build up its military hardware at many times the current rate unfortunately for the emperor darths revan and malak became overly ambitious without his direct supervision and claimed the star forge for themselves 1 revan began a campaign to end the tyranny of the jedi council once and for all together with malak revan went to korriban seized control of the planet secretly establishing a new sith academy not far from the settlement dreshdae  about a year after revans return to known space the first battle of the new conflict called the jedi civil war began in a surprise attack revans fleet swept into the unprepared foerost system quickly overcoming their defenses it was after this battle that revan and malak officially announced to the galaxy that they now were the new sith lords darth revan and darth malak and captured the majority of the republic fleet based in the drydocks around foerost dealing a crippling blow to the republic the second planet to be attacked by the sith was telos iv a strategicallyimportant planet on the edge of republiccontrolled space the telosian military and economic power bases were considered vital to the of the republic although darth revan had intended for telos to be conquered darth malak ordered the former republic admiral saul karath to prove his loyalty to the sith by destroying telos  karath complied 20 darth malak darth revan s sith apprentice and successor cwhile a destructive war revan sought to do as little damage to the republics infrastructure as possible under his leadership sith forces bypassed militarily vital planets that would be required for the defense of the galaxy against the threat of a hidden sith empire which he planned on resisting revan never intended to destroy the republic but to unite it under his banner so it was vital for him to keep the republic largely intact for the purposes of postwar rebuilding revan seeing the need for corporate assistance in providing necessary materiél for the war effort entered a partnership with the czerka corporation a galaxyspanning conglomerate with such diverse interests as mining slaving and manufacturing items such as arms armor and droids offered a trade monopoly within sith space the corporation helped to sponsor the establishment and growth of the dreshdae colony on korriban as part of their supply network the corporation continued to provide logistical support for the sith empire throughout the course of the war they also secured diplomatic relations with the ocean planet of manaan so that they were able to export the healing substance known as kolto revan even took out a number of political figureheads who stood in his way amongst them was yusanis of the echani senator mimas yoon of corellia and lelindor of serroco by doing so revan would be able to begin his rule with a functioning army and a stable economy without his rule being questioned if he would fail to conquer the republic he believed the result would be the same as he intended a stronger republic more capable to defend itself against a hidden sith empire he recollected from his days as the dark lord unlike most revan understood that his war was never truly against the republic but against the jedi revan believed that whoever had the most the strongest jedi would win the war he therefore formed new tactics designed to either convert or to kill captured jedi relying on secrecy instead of brute force his sith assassins quietly flooded into the republic to kill andor abduct jedi throughout known space revan reestablished old strongholds and academies upon worlds of ancient power such as lehon dxun and korriban there his most faithful servants broke captured jedi and converted them to the dark side if any forcesensitive was found within his ranks he captured them as well and made them into dark jedi  21 bastila shan confronts darth revan during his capture  darth revans tactical brilliance caught the republic completely offguard and the sith continued to win battle after battle until a young jedi knight named bastila shan entered the fray with her battle meditation a powerful forcepower that increased the combat effectiveness of the republics forces and sapped the will of enemy combatants the republic knew however that even with bastilas powerful battle meditation they wouldnt be able to stand against the sith for too long so the jedi council drafted a plan to capture darth revan thus depriving the sith of their greatest leader and tactician while darth revans fleet was distracted by a small force of republic warships a jedi striketeam consisting of bastila shan and a number of jedi knights boarded revans flagship overcoming his guards and cornering the dark lord on the bridge of his command ship it was at this time that darth malak saw his chance he ordered the ships under his command to fire upon the bridge of his mentor intending to kill not only the jedi boarding party but his own master in order to claim the mantle of dark lord of the sith for himself unknown to the newly crowned dark lord darth malak however his old mentor was still very much alive as the only other survivor of the attack bastila shan used the force to preserve the flicker of life that still remained within the unconscious dark lord this act caused the formation of a nearphysical bond linked through the force between the two an event that would unknown to both of them have lasting repercussions in the future shan then brought darth revan to the jedi council on dantooine where they decided to use the force to temporarily wipe his memory revan was then reprogrammed with a new identity one that was loyal to the republic while bastila shan was charged with keeping darth revans identity hidden and drawing out the former dark lords memories reign of darth malak and revans reemergence edit edit what greater weapon is there than to turn an enemy to your cause to use their own knowledge against them ― bastila shan srcalthough darth malak lacked the tactical superiority of his former master and instead simply made use of brute force the sheer size of malaks armadas allowed him to win many victories over the battered and outnumbered republic forces unlike darth revan darth malak would destroy worlds rather than capture them ensuring that neither side of the conflict had vital resources throughout the conflict darth malak also became more and more reliant upon the star forge than his mentor had been before him he took a former jedi whose quest for power had set him apart from his fellow students and named him darth bandon making him his shadow hand and the secondincommand in the sith empire as his forces tore through republic space darth malak felt that the only thing that could stop him from taking over the galaxy was shans powerful battle meditation therefore he expended tremendous resources to locate and capture shan hoping to if possible turn her to his cause and if she would not be turned he would eliminate her 22 darth malak leads his sith troopers and dark jedi into battle cthe war continued on and a year later revan who was under an implanted name and with no recollection of his real history or of his former mastery of the force was enlisted as a common soldier in the republic army and placed on the republic warship endar spire darth malaks hunt after shan led him to this ship where he sent darth bandon together with a sith armada to ambush the ship there while boarding the vessel darth bandon encountered revan but before he had the chance to kill the amnesiac dark lord a 23 darth bandon darth malaks sith apprentice crepublic ensign sacrificed himself so that revan could escape the ship shan successfully fled the ship aboard one of the escape pods and crashlanded on taris as did revan along with the republic commander carth onasi malak ordered a blockade of the planet so that the sith could search for shan after crashlanding on the surface of taris revan began experiencing flashbacks through the force of his buried past on taris revan and onasi had to rescue bastila shan from the black vulkars swoop gang with the assistance of the young twilek mission vao her wookiee partner zaalbar and the mandalorian war veteran canderous ordo with the help of his new droid companion t3m4 revan was able to steal the bypass codes to the sith blockade from the sith base and could escape the planet however once revan and his newly formed team including the rescued bastila managed to leave the surface darth malak ordered an orbital bombardment of the planet hoping to eliminate bastila together with the billions of tarisians who died during the attack deciding that they needed to regroup revan and his companions fled to the jedi enclave on dantooine on dantooine revan was retrained in the ways of the force by a reluctant jedi council during his training he would perform some important tasks in the area around the enclave among the tasks was to cleanse a meditation grove of a dark taint the 24 the star map revan found on dantooine taint soon turned out to be a cathar dark jedi named juhani who he redeemed and convinced to return to return to the jedi soon afterwards shan and revan shared a dream of revan and malak exploring the nearby ruins and discovering a star map a rakatan artifact that when combined with the other four star maps revan had used to find the location of the star forge upon learning this the jedi council placed it upon revan and shan to travel to the worlds where the other star maps were hidden and to find the location of the star forge although the council still wanted bastila to continue to draw out revans memories they were also curious to see if revan could accomplish this mission without falling to the dark side juhani also requested that she would join revans party in their search for the star forge revan shan and their companions journeyed to these worlds tracing the steps darth revan and malak had taken years before during these travels they gained two new companions on tatooine revan purchased the assassin droid that he created as a sith lord hk47 and on kashyyyk the selfexiled jedi named jolee bindo joined his party on the search for the star forge additionally the crew of the ebon hawk found themselves hunted by both the sith and bounty hunters and confronted with the problems of the local populace at every turn one of their greatest challenges was when darth bandon finally caught up with the party only to meet his end at the hands of revan throughout their journey revan and bastila grew closer due to the feelings created by their force bond however bastila feared their love thinking it would only lead to the dark side in truth she was afraid to face her feelings out of fear of who revan once was she attempted to resist the feelings yet their love for each other was undeniably strong as the crew was searching for the final star map revan and his allies were captured by the sith flagship leviathan under the command of admiral saul karath as the ebon hawk was being brought in via tractor beam its crew decided that it would be best for another member of the party to use their own talents to either avoid or escape confinement then liberate the rest of the crew aboard theship admiral karath interrogated revan shan and onasi personally informing them of the destruction of the dantooine enclave as he attempted to extract them of information however despite his torturing karath was unable to learn anything after the admirals eventual departure both bastila and revan felt through the force that karath had sent a message to darth malak of their location and that he was making his way towards them meanwhile the ebon hawk crewmember succeeded in getting away from their guards and managed to unlock the holding cells and force cages that held the rest of the group captive 25 the sith navy amassing around the star forge cnow reunited the crew worked together to escape the leviathan on the way however the crew confronted admiral karath on the bridge deck and a furious fire and lightsaber fight took place which resulted in the admirals death with his dying breaths however the onetime republic officer told onasi of revans true nature making a break for it the crew fled towards the ebon hawk but despite their haste the trio was intercepted by the dark lord as surprised as he was amused at the events that had transpired since his betrayal darth malak gleefully filled revan in on the details of who he was—and what he had been made into revan who was shocked by the revelation asked bastila if he spoke truefully she told him that he was and went on to explain everything following their brief discussion darth malak created a stasis field around shan and onasi and prepared to end his former master revan proved himself a capable swordsman however holding his own against the dark lord however shan intervened so that revan and onasi could escape darth malak defeated and captured her reluctantly revan and onasi left and they together with the rest of the crew escaped the leviathan revan was thus forced to deal with darth malaks revelation and the loss of his beloved bastila 26 the rakata outside the temple of the ancients darth malak then attempted to make bastila turn to the dark side and become his new sith apprentice torturing her with force lightning she was firm at first but after a week of endless torture he eventually succeeded in breaking her and finally turned her to the dark side he made shan his new apprentice replacing the previously slain darth bandon the true reason he could gain from her battle meditation as the preparations for the star forge were nearing completion and the sith forces had grown to be vaster than ever before revan found the fifth and final star map and discovered the location of the star forge upon arriving the ebon hawk was forced to crash on the unknown planet due to its disruptor field with their hyperdrive damaged onasi was forced to make an emergency landing on one of the planets smaller islands—the very same island that held the temple of the ancients after several runins with the native rakata revan was able to piece together what had transpired during his and malaks last visit to the forgotten world with the help of the rakata he accompanied by jolee bindo and juhani entered the temple of the ancients in order to shut down the disruptor field so that the incoming republic fleet would not suffer a similar fate at the top the temple they were confronted by bastila now the sith apprentice to darth malak mocking the three that she would aid darth malak in conquering the galaxy and taunting the anguished revan she engaged all three of them in a brief lightsaber duel shan was no match for revans power and threw a force wave at the three in order to save herself from defeat after seeing how powerful revan was she came to believe revan deserved to be the dark lord of the sith she then attempted to entice revan to reclaim his former title and take her as his apprentice revan rejected bastilas temptation choosing the path of the jedi and tried to turn bastila back to the light reminding her of the bond between them not of the force but of love angered at her failure to turn revan shan retreated to the star forge where she and revan would face each other again during the final battle  the fall of darth malak and revans departure to the unknown regions edit edit the defeat of darth malak at the hands of a redeemed revan as envisioned by duron qeldroma c once again we shall face each other in single combat and the victor will decide the fate of the galaxy ―darth malak to revan srcrevan and his crew repaired the ebon hawk and pursued shan as a republic fleet and a group of surviving jedi from the jedi enclave arrived commencing an assault on the star forge revan together with two companions and a jedi strike team boarded the star forge in hopes of disrupting shans battle meditation enough to give the republic fleet a chance aboard the star forge revan displayed his restored affinity for the force and mastery of lightsaber combat by nearly singlehandedly confronting and defeating malaks army of star forge battle droids and dark jedi in the star forges war room revan faced off against shan once again this time alone though shan was able to draw on the star forge to renew her strength revan still bested her she begged revan to kill her after all she had done but revan attempted to convince her to return to the light side by drawing on the powerful bond of love they shared he succeeded and shan used her battle meditation to aid the republic turning the tide of the climactic battle as shan used her powers to turn the tide of the engagement revan went on to confront darth malak atop the highest levels of the station there revan faced darth malak in a brutal lightsaber duel during which the dark lord attempted to siphon off the remaining forceenergy of several dead jedi revan however was able to use his own power to prevent further instances of this siphoning after defeating his former apprentice he and shan along with onasi and the others boarded the ebon hawk and escaped the stations destruction with the star forge destroyed the will of the remaining sith forces in orbit was broken and they were defeated in detail as a result of this action the destructive war that had claimed so many lives—on both sides—finally came to an end revan and his crew were given a heros escort back to lehon there they were each rewarded with the cross of glory the republics highest award jedi master vandar tokare also thanked revan rebestowing his rank of jedi knight and proclaiming him the prodigal knight and his friends as the heroes of the era and galaxy after the wars end however revan began to recover more and more of his lost memories despite what the jedi had done to wipe them away even as the republic attempted to stamp out the last vestiges of the sith empire sending a task force to korriban approximately a year after wars end only to find empty ruins strewn with the remains of dead sith as time went on the former dark lord remembered the threat posed by a hidden sith empire that he had encountered in the unknown regions leaving behind his love shan along with those who had served alongside him at wars end and all of his possessions revan departed known space in order to face this threat in his own way the exiled jedi master kreia who had taught revan for a time when he was still a padawan had gone in search of both him and what had driven him to leave the republic behind and wage a war against it eventually she too found malachor v and corrupted by its dark energies began to form the sith triumvirate  the sith triumvirate and the first jedi purge edit edit the heart of the trayus academy  c to be united by hatred is a… fragile alliance at best ― darth traya srcwith the death of darth malak and revans disappearance the sith were left with a massive power vacuum that resulted in their own civil war the lesser sith lords of the empire left without a strong leader turned upon each other attempting to take what scraps they could from the ruins of the empire declaring themselves sovereign warlords they fractured the empire into a number of small hotlycontested kingdoms at the height of the civil war on korriban revan led a host of jedi in an invasion of the sith homeworld and his forces successfully drove the sith lords from the planet when republic forces arrived on korriban approximately a year after the jedi civil wars conclusion they found the planet to be barren and lifeless with the fall of the sith empire the galactic republic was able to conquer sith space and reclaim worlds that had been under sith control since the great sith war  after the fall of korriban only one sith faction remained active in republic space a secretive and elusive sith faction known as the sith triumvirate led by the three sith lords darth traya and her apprentices darth sion and darth nihilus darth traya was the sith alias of the former jedi master kreia the first and last master of revan who was exiled by the jedi council for her part in revans training and of others who the council deemed as failures after her exile from the order she started questioning her beliefs and philosophy she began searching for answers meeting those she had affected through her teachings eventually she came to malachor v a dead world powerful in the dark side she was curious and the sith ruins drawed her in she became overpowered with the allure of the dark side and became darth traya the lord of betrayal having been betrayed by the jedi and ready to betray in turn she attained the title of headmistress of the trayus academy able to hold any students willing to fight for the cause of the sith to destroy the jedi two more sith lords came to join forces with darth traya on malachor the first was darth nihilus the lord of hunger who before becoming a sith lost everything to the mandalorians during the war a survivor of the mass shadow generator in the wars final battle at malachor v the experience of the shadows made him hunger for force energy and the affliction began to ravage his body in his pain he became a wound in the force and was found by darth traya she told him that she could teach him to feed his hunger he accepted her offer becoming trayas apprentice the next to come darth sion the lord of pain was a longtime sith having served exar kun s sith empire until the day he was struck down 27 darth sion strikes down a jedi crather than die though sion found that by calling on his pain anger and hatred he could rise from certain death and achieve immortality at the cost of allconsuming agony with a body fractured and decomposing but held together by the dark side of the force sion survived the great sith war when the civil war broke out sion fled korriban coming to malachor v where he found the trayus academy darth traya and training his brutality and strength were something noted by traya during his tutelage under her but the two soon disliked each other because rather than yearn for knowledge or studies as she did he sought hatred and power at the completion of their training these three were now corulers of an empire the remnants of revan and malaks forces soon joined them on malachor v where they subtly intervened with galactic affairs using trayas idea of echoes in the force and corrupting jedi to the dark side sion quickly grew impatient of waiting to fight the jedi and the republic while nihilus grew hungry and needed force sustenance the two conspired against traya for a time and then when she was vulnerable they struck she was cornered from two sides in the trayus core while meditating and violently subdued during this time the two lords used an unknown force technique to sever her connection to the force also making her lose the evil that had corrupted her in the first place traya lord of betrayal was betrayed again cast out by both jedi and sith kreia directed her anger towards the force itself treating it like an insidious god she left the sith triumvirate she started and began to direct her attention towards the jedi exile a jedi exiled from the jedi order for following revan into war sion and nihilus now had dual control of the remnants of the empire becaming the new dark lords of the sith however while they shared the belief in jedi extermination their conflicting philosophies ruled out working together they split the empire into equal portions and went their separate ways they took their respective factions into hiding and initiated a covert shadow war against the jedi starting the first jedi purge sion led an army of sith assassins from the trayus academy in a bloody crusade while nihilus worked from his ship controlling his halfdead thralls and using his powers to feed on the lifeforce of entire worlds gravitating towards planets with a jedi presence though working independently the two reduced the number of surviving jedi down to less than one hundred by 3951 bby  trayas retribution edit edit survival and search edit edit kreia during her exile cwhile the new dark lords thought darth traya dead this was not the case left extremely weakened she managed to escape and went into self imposed exile claiming the ebon hawk revans old ship for herself she proceed to wander the galaxy searching for a specific jedi veteran of the mandalorian wars the veteran in question was one of the military leaders on the republics side a high ranking general she led numerous battles and was involved in the final battle at malachor v it was she who ordered the zabrak engineer baodur to activate the mass shadow generator at malachor decimating the mandalorian fleet with the end of the war she was the only jedi to answer the jedi councils summons and return to coruscant within the high council chamber within the jedi temple on coruscant she stood before the jedi for judgement due to her experiences at malachor v she had involuntarily disconnected herself from the force becoming a wound in the force an empty void sensing the emptiness within her and unsure how to deal with it or its ramifications the council exiled her 2the exile took to wandering the galaxy gradually revisiting most of the old battlegrounds where she had fought as she travelled to telos aboard the republic cruiser harbinger she was drugged and stowed away by an hk50 assassin droid looking to collect on the jedi bounty posted by the exchange crime syndicate however as this took place the harbinger encountered the ebon hawk which was being pursued by a sith warship commanded by darth sion the hawk was allowed to land on the harbinger while it docked with the sith warship and searched it traya having retaken her original identity as kreia found the jedi exile and took her aboard the ebon hawk unknowingly followed by the hk50 at the same time the harbinger search teams found the sith warship empty with the exception of a heavily mutilated body that somehow remained just barely alive despite the extreme damage it showed 2the body was revealed to be darth sion himself sion relied on his ragefuelled power in the force to literally pull his body back together achieving a form of immortality and used this ability to masquerade as a dead body however as he could only keep his body together not repair the damage it sustained he was left in constant agony and had the appearance of that which he pretended to be a corpse 2near disaster edit edit bursting out of the kolto tank that his body had been placed in he commandeered the ship with the aid of the sith assassin crew of his warship that had secretly infiltrated the harbinger when it had docked with his own ship via umbilical as he took over kreia took off in the ebon hawk with the drugged jedi exile in tow however the now sithcontrolled harbinger fired on the hawk as it jumped into hyperspace forcing the ship to make a droid controlled landing at the paragus mining facility at the facility the blacked out jedi exile and neardead kreia were placed in the medical bay while the hk50 stowaway assumed the role of the facilities maintenance assistant the assassin droid used his new position to reprogram the facilities droid miners to attack the organic ones fool the computers into believing that there was an explosion confining the remaining miners to the reinforced dormitories sabotage the ventilation system to kill the trapped miners and cause all the medbay patients including the exile to receive a nearlethal dose of sedative 2 darth sion on the corpsestrewn bridge of the harbinger while the other patients were killed by this the exiles jedi training enabled her to withstand the effects and survive as hk50 anticipated however she withstood the effects far better than the droid intended and awoke wandering the medbay the exile encountered the now recovered kreia and began searching the facility for an escape route meeting the confined atton rand with rands help they managed to find a way to the hanger where the ebon hawk was kept fortunately the ship had been repaired under orders from the hk50 to serve as an escape vehicle however before they could escape the harbinger under sions command arrived at the facility and docked as they needed the current asteroid drift charts to navigate the field surrounding paragus they were forced to board the harbinger to obtain them battling and destroying the hk50 along the way 2unfortunately before they could make good their escape they encountered darth sion while atton rand and the exile fled to the ebon hawk kreia remained behind to hold off sion after a short conversation between the two during which kreia hid from her former apprentice with the force sion took advantage of a momentary lapse in her illusion to amputate her hand with a lightning fast strike this caused a force link between kreia and the exile to reveal itself as the exile felt kreias pain despite this they managed to escape to telos unfortunately the paragus mining facility was destroyed by sion as he pursued them an event that would have drastic ramifications for the republic 2telos edit edit their visit to telos was a total debacle firstly as they had come from paragus they were arrested in connection with the destruction of the facility while in custody the ebon hawk was stolen and they were attacked by a bounty hunter that had infiltrated the telos security force then they were confined to house arrest and while they were eventually let go they were still confined to the telos citadel station in orbit above the ravaged world though they managed to procure a shuttle to journey down to one of the restoration zones on telos surface they were shot down by a czerka corporation survey team fortunately they encountered baodur who had taken a job as shield technician on telos he pulled them out of the burning wreck and helped them escape the restoration zone commandeering a shuttle in the ruins of the telos military base in the shuttle they flew to a secret academy established by jedi master atris at the north pole of telos there the exile met with atris and negotiated the return of the ebon hawk which had been stolen by her agents 2 kreia blackmails atton rand cwhile the exile met with atris kreia forcefully probed atton rands mind discovering that he had been one of the sith troopers during the jedi civil war specializing in jedi hunting… and torturing atton who was deeply ashamed of his actions was blackmailed by kreia to be an instrument of her manipulations mission edit edit once under way again the exile resolved to gather the remaining jedi supposedly to fight back against the sith but truly to get an explanation of what happened to her and why she was exiled they proceeded to journey to the various worlds the jedi masters were last known to have been on dantooine they found master vrook lamar and aided him at defeating an exchangecontrolled mercenary army bent on destroying the worlds fragile government on nar shaddaa they became involved in the vicious intrigue between the exchange the hutt crime lords and the bounty hunters guild in the end the exile was captured by goto the exchange crime boss controlling nar shaddaa in the midst of all this jedi master zezkai ell revealed himself and helped rescue the exile from goto goto his control over nar shaddaa in shamble joined the exiles party revealing himself to actually be the droid g0t0 obsessed with order and with no affiliation to any party g0t0 sought to use the exile as an instrument to create order fortunately as g0t0 was the one who originally placed the bounty on the jedi in the first place his joining of their party forced him to rescind it 2on onderon they became involved with the onderon civil war between the hereditary ruler queen talia and the isolationist militant upstart general vaklu gaining the aid of the mandalorians now led by canderous ordo they managed to end the war siding with talia and the royalists however they found out that the militant faction led by vaklu had been receiving aid from the sith specifically darth nihilus faction while the war was ended and jedi master kavar who had been serving as talias advisor during the crisis was freed up to join the gathering on dantooine on korriban they found the corpse of lonna vash in the torture chamber of the sith academy as they prepared to leave they encountered darth sion after a quick lightsaber duel they were forced to flee sion let them go feeling that the jedi exile had earned the right 2battle of telos edit edit darth nihilus during the onderon civil war kreia allowed one of general vaklus subordinates the colonel tobin to escape tobin fled to nihilus and told the sith lord the information given him by kreia regarding the existence of the jedi academy atris established on telos the information was a lie the only jedi there was atris herself while the rest of the residents were echani handmaidens trained to resist the force in any case nihilus prepared to attack telos in order to drain the apparent jedi academy and once again sate his hunger 2as this took place the jedi exile travelled to dantooine and met with the masters unfortunately the masters decided that the exiles condition as a wound in the force made her a threat to the force itself and prepared to use their powers to permanently sever her connection to it however before they could do so kreia burst in on them reclaiming her identity of darth traya she used to force to drain their connection to it killing them while the exile laid unconscious traya was led to jedi master atris for judgment by one of the exiles companions the echani handmaiden brianna journeying to the telosian jedi academy traya revealed that atris had herself been corrupted and turned to the dark side by the sith holocrons she gathered but could not admit it even to herself atris then embraced the dark side openly but was soon confronted and defeated by the exile 2with atris defeated the exile turned her attention to darth nihilus who had just arrived insystem while the republic fleet arrived to hold nihilus fleet the exile boarded the sith lords flagship the ravager and with the aid of canderous ordos mandalorian commandos they prepared destroy the ship as this was done the exile confronted darth nihilus and engaged the sith lord in combat sith lord attempted to absorb the exiles force energy however he failed and exhausted himself this was due to the exiles natural ability to draw on the force energy of those around her mirroring nihiluss as a result of her tie to the force being cut at the end of the battle of malachor v they engaged in a quick fight with the dark lord seemingly too strong to defeat then the exile learned of his aversion to her force energy signature and turned the tide against him nihilus former apprentice visas marr now one of the exiles companions entered a trance and tried to disrupt the link with her former master undermining his connection to the force through their force bond nihilus was defeated vanishing in a haze of dark side energy 2reclaiming power edit edit darth traya know that there was once a darth traya and that she cast aside that role was exiled and found a new purpose but there must always be a darth traya one that holds the knowledge of betrayal who has been betrayed in their heart and will betray in turn ― darth traya srctraya returned to the trayus academy subverting darth sion and becoming his master once more having reclaimed her lost power she waited for the exile the jedi exile following information from atris arrived on malachor and stormed the sith academy fighting her way through the army of sith assassins and apprentices populating the training center she confronted darth sion at the entrance to the trayus core after a lengthy battle she convinced the sith lord to let go of his rage and allow himself to die as sion became that which he appeared to be he expressed relief at finally leaving the world the exile entered the core and confronted traya after a discussion where traya revealed her disgust towards the idea of the will of the force and her intention to strip the force of its will the two fought their bout abruptly ended when the exile cut off trayas remaining hand however the sith used her telekinetic abilities to summon up a trio of lightsabers to assail the exile the exile managed to cut down the weapons and defeat traya while this took place one of baodurs droids made its way through the wastes of malachor v and found the remains of the mass shadow generator in several crashed ships reactivating the weapon the trayus academy was destroyed while the exile and her companions managed to escape aboard the salvaged ebon hawk 2 the sith were once again though not for the last time destroyed the empire’s spy and naga sadow’s return edit edit barel ovair a sith infiltrator posing as a jedi although the jedi thought the sith were defeated the sith empire that revan had once encountered still existed in fact they had planted a sith infiltrator within the jedi order itself barel ovair barel selected eison gynt to be his padawan and together traveled the galaxy studying the force and accepting the most dangerous of missions for the order ovair was then given a mission by his superiors he must destroy all of the long dead spirits of the sith who might attempt to challenge the sith emperor ’s return thus the spy and his padawan undertook the mission to yavin 4 the jedi order and gynt believed they were to destroy the spirit of naga sadow which still lingered in his tomb on the planet in order to finally cleanse the dark side planet so barel was free to defeat the spirit without hesitation unfortunately the pair was attacked by massassi warriors that still lived on the surface and they were forced to retreat into the temple of the dead sith lord 28 eison gynt possessed by naga sadow later ovair

have returned ― darth malgus during the sacking of coruscant — 30 listen  file info srcsith troops marching into battle in the aftermath of the great hyperspace war the old sith empire was largely decimated by the final conflict between naga sadow and ludo kressh and was forced to retreat to the unknown regions by the republic leading to the belief that the empire was defeated the reason for revans betrayal of the republic was to strengthen it for its inevitable rematch with the old sith empire however with his plans largely undone by malaks rampage he journeyed into the unknown regions to search out the empire and possibly stem the tide whatever his intent or actions the sith empire ultimately returned it had been three centuries since the jedi civil war revans disappearance and the collapse of the sith triumvirate the sith were thought long dead so the invasion came as a total surprise their invasion marked the beginning of the decades long great war the sith quickly seized most of the outer rim destroying the sluis van shipyards the battlegrounds spread to include such remote worlds as ilum or dathomir despite manaans attempts to remain neutral it was ravaged by the sith and the republic suffered further defeats at agamar and utapau however a heroic struggle at bothawui helped slow the sith onslaught and the jedi were able to bring the dark siders advance to a halt in the mid rim it was during this time that the sith emperor hatched a plan to capture enemy combatants and program into them his very essence his apprentice exal kressh betrayed him and led a republic attack on the sith homeworld of korriban there she faced teneb kel the sith apprentice chosen to hunt her down 31 the new mandalore meeting with imperial agents however things for the republic were vastly complicated by the rebirth of the mandalorians in the bloody arenas of geonosis a gladiator who called himself the new mandalore rose to prominence the sith imperial intelligence saw a tremendous opportunity in this gladiator dispatching agents to rig the arena bouts they ensured the warriors epic rise to power beating all his opponents in the arena the gladiator claimed the currently defunct title of mandalore all surviving mandalorians answered the new mandalores call and flocked to his banner fulfilling his end of the bargain with the sith the new mandalore command was simple face the greatest challenge the galaxy has to offer and battle the jedi knights obviously the plan was to disrupt the jedi war effort against the sith in order to provoke the jedi the mandalorians blockaded the rimma trade route cutting off supplies to and from the outer rim and hurting the war effort against the sith empire left with no choice the jedi were forced to attack the mandalorian blockade in an attempt to break it the attack was a total failure the jedi were soundly defeated and the mandalorians continued their blockade were it not for the efforts of daring smugglers led by hylo visz the republic would have fallen much sooner visz gathered all the supply ships she could find loaded them down and parked them less than a parsec from the mandalorian fleet distracted by the suspicion freighters the mandalorians were caught off guard by a joint republicsmuggler attack breaking the blockade the jedi war effort was able to continue visz was hailed as a hero and the mandalorians disbanded the new mandalore leading some of their number to seek new challenges while the rest returned to mercenary work ultimately the new mandalore was assassinated and replaced though the allegiance of the current mandalore remains ambiguous however due to their delays in the mid rim the sith tactics became increasingly aggressive and desperate the sith emperor became increasingly impatient having expected to triumph quickly in his impatience he presented a surprising offer to the republic a peace treaty the jedi council advised caution but even they admitted that the war was unwinnable peace was the only option 32 sith warriors storming the jedi temple while diplomats and senators convened on alderaan for negotiations with the sith the dark siders played their final card they attacked coruscant using a stolen republic ship a group of sith warriors crashlanded within the entrance to the jedi temple itself rendezvousing with darth malgus who had arrived just previously and a sithhired bounty hunter who had disabled the temple security system sacking the temple they disabled the coruscant defense mainframe allowing their forces to land and storm the planet with the republics capital firmly in their grip the imperial delegation took command of the alderaan peace conference lord baras introduced the republic diplomats to the treaty of coruscant an agreement greatly biased towards the sith that would shape galactic events for decades although the jedi orders representatives protested senator amris agreed to the terms the war was ended but coruscant was subjected to the rule of the empires dark council for a short time 33 the new galactic map after the treaty of coruscant cwith the sith takeover of coruscant the empire now controlled half of the galaxy and thanks to the treaty of coruscant they were recognized as a legitimate government for the first time in their history the jedi and republic troops were recalled from their many battles leaving thousands of star systems to fend for themselves under sith control with the jedi temple on coruscant ransacked and in ruins the jedi order was forced to relocate choosing their ancient homeworld of tython as the sith empire consolidated its power and the galactic republic licked its wounds the cold war began the cold war was a period of uncertainty and high tension between the two factions bordor skirmishes and proxy wars between the two powers brought the uneasy truce to the brink of collapse however neither side was ready to resume all out war and the sith emperors interests seemed to turn to something other than conquest he handed control of the empire over to his dark council which oversaw the daytoday affairs of the regime and went on to pursue his own mysterious goals while the cold war broiled the jedi order reconnected with their roots and for the most part secluded themselves from galactic affairs as public opinion had largely turned against them and irate senators blamed them for the war desolous insurgence edit edit darth desolous c a thousand jedi died cursing darth desolous ― darth desolous srcapproximately one hundred years after the end of the cold war a pauan forcesensitive was discovered by the jedi brought into the order he eventually became a revered and powerful jedi master however his innate lust for battle drove him to seek out sith teachings which forced the jedi to expel him from the order 3the master declared himself dark lord of the sith and took on the name darth desolous desolous returned home to utapau and proceeded to build an army around him training hundreds of fellow pauans in a personalized version of jedi fighting techniques and equipping them with cortosis alloy shields he then rallied his army and embarked on a bloody campaign against the jedi order using ambush and guerrilla fighting tactics desolous and his army ultimately slaughtered over two thousand jedi 3however with each victory desolous grew increasingly reckless and bold his hatred of the jedi eclipsing all other emotions or reason in his recklessness desolous allowed himself and his army to be drawn into a trap at yaga minor where he and his army were destroyed 3the new sith wars edit edit ruin edit edit darth ruin c there is nothing… only me ―from the creed of ruin srcseveral hundred years after the fall of darth desolous another charismatic and revered jedi master fell to the dark side and recreated the sith this time it was the umbaran phanius a renegade master known for a disturbing philosophy which included elements of moral relativism and solipsism possibly echoed in certain aspects by the much later potentium belief 4leaving the jedi order to pursue prohibited sith teachings phanius became the first of what would be known as the lost twenty the newly christened darth ruin set about recreating the sith uniting the various splinter factions that remained from the old sith wars and the cold war and gaining the allegiance of fifty turncoat jedi knights in an event known as the fourth great schism ruin proceeded to initiate the new sith wars against the jedi 4however his newfound power was not to last ruin in his allconsuming ambition and singleminded hatred of the jedi caused the deaths of thousands of his own followers sometimes on a whim ultimately ruins actions led to the betrayal of his followers and he was assassinated however the new sith wars continued on and off for almost a millennium 4the dark underlord edit edit the dark underlord following the death of darth ruin several dark lords rose to power and reorganized the sith renewing war against the republic one of the first after ruin was a mysterious being known only as the dark underlord theories regarding his true identity often gravitated towards him being a sith spirit summoned from chaos some even stating that he was the resurrection of the lettow general xendor 5during the first quarter of the war the underlord was a bloody marauder who earned the ire of the republic attaining leadership of the sith the underlord consolidated a number of elite sith warriors known as the black knights setting up a base on malrev iv they continued the war against the republic 5as the dark underlord fought the republic he found a nemesis in the jedi general murrtaggh the jedi general in a scheme to infiltrate the underlords fortress on malrev iv hired a group of mandalorian mercenaries to stage a diversionary attack while he broke into the fortress and assassinated the underlord murrtagghs plan was ultimately successful but at a terrible price he confronted the underlord and slew him but fell to the dark side as he struck down the dark lord 5rivan edit edit darth rivan darkness is a friend an ally darkness allows us to understand others to see what they value when they believe no one else is looking it allows us to be honest with ourselves to express those values that we would disavow in the light the light blinds us it is only in the dark that we see clearly and there is a great dark hidden among these worlds ―darth rivan srcsometime after the fall of the dark underlord a zelosian sith lord christened darth rivan rose to power rivan settled on the planet almas and built a fortress on the world however unlike many of his predecessors who devoted themselves to war against the republic rivans primary occupation was study his goal was to find a way to eliminate the inherent infighting amongst the sith as enlightened cooperation was not considered a virtue amongst darksiders rivans researches turned his fortress into a massive focal point of dark side energy and resulted in the creation of the sith battlelords the battlelords successfully implemented rivans goal of eliminating infighting by causing a forcebond to form between a commander and all of his subordinates ensuring that whenever a subordinate attempted to assassinate his superior officer the damage would instead be inflicted upon the soldier 6rivans other researches resulted in the creation of the kaluthin grass which modified the toxic landscape and atmosphere of almas terraforming the planet into a gardenlike paradise at some point he also gained possession an artifact known as the darkstaff an insidious semisentient weapon capable of draining the force essence from living beings 7it was initially believed that rivan was betrayed and killed by his own apprentice darsin after being driven off almas by a joint republicjedi assault in truth the darkstaff created a massive force storm that swept across the surface of almas and transported rivan through space and time to ruusan during the final battle of the new sith wars several centuries later he perished in the battle being left extremely weakened by the journey 8until the rise of darth bane in the very same battle that resulted in his death he was the last sith lord known to use the darth title darzu edit edit belia darzu dark lord of the sith she was a student of sith alchemy it was said she learned the secrets of mechuderu the ability to transform the flesh of living beings into metal and machinery ― hetton to darth zannah srcsome time after rivans fall a new dark lord known as belia darzu rose to power prior to her ascendance the shiido darzu was a dark side marauder and a sith alchemist as dark lord darzu made the ancient jedi world of tython her seat of power building a fortress and the planet and commencing with her alchemic experimentations saturating the world with the dark side 9among her creations was a suit of heavy battle armor that was imbued with the dark side granting the wearer invisibility and enhanced physical strength however possibly darzus most insidious creation was her personal army of technobeasts creatures whom she had mutated into twisted mechanical versions of their former selves through a combination of nanogene technology and the dark side of the force she controlled this army through the use of the sith alchemic technique mechuderu 9belia darzu was ultimately assassinated by sith of the mecrosa order who had her poisoned at the behest of her fellow sith lords though she died her knowledge survived in the form of her many notes and journals left intact within her fortress and her holocron 9brotherhood of darkness edit edit lord kaan cdue to the constant infighting amongst the sith their empire was fractured into numerous pieces selfproclaimed sith lords rose to establish their own personal domains while enslaved masses suffered under the rule of these warlords into this hostile political climate came kaan however unlike his fellows who were more concerned with establishing personal dominance kaan focused on bringing down the ailing republic to this end he set about uniting the various factions of the empire under a single banner 10kaans plan to unite the empire was unique in sith history rather than individually challenge each of the dark lords to gain possession of their forces kaan instead acquiesced to their vanity naming them all dark lords of the sith and declaring them equal within the empire advocating cooperation and unity within the sith kaan ended the ageold power struggle and gained the backing of all the dark lords who swore loyalty to him 10thanks to kaans efforts the sith empire was reorganized into the brotherhood of darkness and in a political sense was now more united and stronger than before under kaans leadership the brotherhood set about destroying the republic securing the galaxy for the sith 10sith campaigns edit edit this victory sends a message to the republic and the jedi now they will truly know and fear the brotherhood ―kaan srcnow united under a single banner and with a common goal in mind the sith onslaught was vicious and inexorable gaining a startling victory at korriban the sith reclaimed the sith tombworld and reopened the sith academy kaan installed several of his lieutenants as the leaders with lord qordis serving as headmaster 10soon after kaan moved on to his next target ruusan this world was largely insignificant save for its strategic placement kaan planned on using ruusan as the staging area for the sith invasion of the core worlds the first battle of ruusan was a total sith victory with the republic forces routed and annihilated thanks to kaans battle meditation as they prepared to launch their invasion kaan easily repelled the republic counterattack 10however in the subsequent battles of the war kaan noticed a disturbing absence of jedi this absence was explained when ruusan was suddenly attacked by the jedi army of light led by lord hoth the sith forces were driven offplanet though kaan quickly moved to retake the world thus began the protracted ruusan campaign 10during this series of battles both the jedi and the sith began to unravel members of both groups beginning to lose faith in their leaders it was into this hostile climate that darth bane emerged 10the rise of darth bane edit edit darth bane cbanes emergence edit  the man who would eventually become darth bane was born on the republic mining world of apatros dessel was born to an abusive father and cortosis miner named hurst bullied by his father and the other miners dessel became a highly aggressive though cunning individual fighting back until they left him alone known by the derogatory nickname bane given by his father to the bane of his existence dessel eventually learned to ignore the jibes and insults directed at him by the other miners 10however dessel was challenged to a fight one day by one of his now dead fathers friends gerd dessel bit off the drunken miners thumb suspended from work dessel went to the local cantina a little earlier than usual beating the crowds there he got into a game of sabacc with a group of off duty republic officers offended by his casual veiled insults and enraged that dessel won they attacked him as he left dessel killed one of them in the ensuing fight 10knowing that the republic officials would imprison him for killing the officer even though he was the aggressor dessel fled the planet and joined the sith army rising to the rank of sergeant in the gloom walkers unit dessels skill as a soldier along with his unconscious use of the force caused the unit to become one of the most famous in the military however during the battle of phaseera the unit was sent on a suicide mission the units co ulabore was too terrified of the sith lords to consider questioning the order so dessel incapacitated him and took command 10though the mission was successful ulabore had dessel taken to be courtmartialed however he was intercepted by the sith lord kopecz who had him sent to the sith academy on korriban instead presented with an offer to join the ranks of the dark lords dessel accepted as a sign that he had cast off his old identity dessel took on the derogatory nickname his father had for him becoming bane 10training on korriban edit edit bane cbane immediately began his training under the masters of the academy on his own initiative he studied the academy archives for ancient lore something discouraged by the current masters who emphasized their difference rather than attempted to continue the old ways eventually bane began to abandon his studies in the archives to focus on physical and mental exercises challenging one of his fellow students fohargh to a sparring bout bane was beaten though he killed his opponent with the force in a blind rage 10however his killing of fohargh caused him to think back on the death of his father and bane suddenly realized that he had unconsciously killed his father this revelation caused him to doubt his ability and bane began losing his connection to the dark side this caused his progress to slip and after a disastrous failure in a sparring match bane was denied the right to train with the other students 10as he could no longer attend classes bane resumed his studies in the archives as he learned of the ancient sith and their ways bane began to question the edicts of the brotherhood of darkness however he continued to despair in his own abilities and it was only the intervention of githany that kicked him out of his stupor 10githany was a jedi deserter who had provided the sith with intelligence on the jedi movements in exchange for membership taking her place at the academy her jedi training provided her with an edge over the other students and she became one of the foremost apprentices a primary obstacle towards her advancement however was sirak sirak was the top student at the academy and the only individual skilled enough to cause her worry 10githany saw the opportunity to destroy sirak in bane and approached him the two formed an alliance and githany began providing bane with the training he was forced to miss out on helping bane regain his connection to the dark side though he continued to play the weakling to keep siraks guard down while receiving training in force techniques from githany bane also met with the academy swordmaster kasim receiving lightsaber instruction from him thanks to the efforts of these two teachers whom bane kept secret from one another he gained sufficient power and skill to challenge sirak the bout was an unprecedented victory for bane and sirak suffered his first defeat however bane allowed sirak to live shaking githanys and kasims faith in him 10despite this bane was now the top student at the academy 10rebellion edit edit after his bout with sirak bane was approached by lord qordis the headmaster revealed that he had been aware of the secret training bane received from kasim and githany for some time and saluted banes progress however he also ordered bane to cease studying the sith archives citing the brotherhoods efforts to seek a new path rather than continue the old ways 10enraged by this bane travelled to valley of the sith lords and began inspecting the tombs looking for some way to prove qordis wrong and validate the old ways finding nothing he determined that the current sith were too weak to deserve the wisdom of the ancients and the old sith spirits had abandoned them returning to the academy he was ambushed by a vengeful sirak along with siraks two lackeys and githany however githany changed allegiances halfway through the fight aiding bane in killing sirak 10shortly afterwards the academy received word of the disastrous ruusan campaign as the sith forces were in dire need of reinforcements all the students immediately graduated and granted the rank of dark lord however bane refused to accompany his fellow students abandoning his mentors and rebelling against the brotherhood 10as a sign of his difference bane claimed the forbidden and defunct title of darth darth bane proceeded to steal lord qordis ship and left korriban 10the holocron of darth revan edit edit the temple of the ancients on lehon cfollowing coordinates he discovered in the korriban archives darth bane travelled to the unknown regions to lehon landing on the unknown world bane dominated a rancor beast through force persuasion travelling to the rakatan temple of the ancients entering bane began combing the structure for relics and artifacts eventually his search led him to the sublevels there he discovered a secret compartment in the central chamber containing the holocron of darth revan 10opening the device bane was given access to a plethora of information on the ancient sith and their abilities bane managed to create a personal library of handwritten records of the information before the holocrons power cell depleted receiving a final message from darth revan using revan’s knowledge and teachings as inspiration bane came to believe that the force specifically the dark side was finite and that the brotherhood of darkness in addition to disregarding traditional sith beliefs was spreading the dark side too thinly bane became determined to destroy the brotherhood and reform the sith in accordance with his own philosophy the rule of two this new edict reduced sith numbers to merely two individuals the master and the apprentice to ensure a line of secession the apprentice would eventually assassinate and replace the master after learning all he could before taking an apprentice of his own continuing the sith 10while bane made his revelations the brotherhood of darkness was worried by his absence from their ranks as he had been one of their most powerful members kaan fearful of bane’s intentions after githany told him of a vision she experienced dispatched kasim to lehon with an ultimatum join us or die 10kasim followed the homing beacon in bane’s ship which bane had not bothered to deactivate finding the wayward dark lord’s landing site confronting bane in the temple of the ancients the two had a brief heated discussion which ended in conflict in the ensuing lightsaber duel kasim almost managed to defeat bane with his knowledge of dualsaber combat which bane had not received training in however in the end bane prevailed demolishing the temple of the ancients with a massive force blast while kasim was still inside 10using kasim’s death as the excuse bane began playing the weakling again using this facade to deceive the brotherhood into believing that he was ready to rejoin them sending some of his records from revan’s holocron as proof of his sincerity meeting with githany on ambria bane was almost killed by her being poisoned by a sample of the toxin synox githany covered her lips with when they shared a kiss too weakened to heal himself bane rushed across the ambrian desert to the hut of the healer caleb taking caleb’s daughter hostage bane forced the man to treat him cured by the healer bane allowed him to live feeling that he could be a useful contact in the future 10with that bane departed for ruusan 10destruction of the brotherhood of darkness edit edit darth bane leading the dark side ritual during the sixth battle of ruusan carriving on ruusan during the aftermath of the fifth battle of the campaign darth bane stormed in on the dark lords during a strategic briefing disgusted by kaan’s mindset bane accused him of thinking like a dirt general rather than a proper sith lord kaan decided to accept bane’s tactical advise and the dark lords gathered together in a ritual led by bane unleashing a dark side fuelled wave of destruction upon the jedi forces 10while the attack itself was a total success the dark lords sensed darth bane’s intention and broke the ritual attacking the jedi personally while their forces were in disarray bane though enraged by their initiative took advantage of the situation to thin their number while the dark lords led the assault bane went to kaan’s tent and used his communication equipment to order the sith fleet to attack the jedi fleet breaking the sith blockade and allowing the jedi to send reinforcements the sith were unexpectedly attacked and forced to flee before the sith arrived back at camp bane was approached by qordis who sought to join bane bane flatly refused and killed qordis 10confronted by kaan bane pretended to be dominated by kaan’s force persuasion and manipulated kaan into preparing the thought bomb the thought bomb was an ancient sith weapon of terrible power a massive focus of dark side energy that when detonated would cause mass devastation across a wide area and kill any powerful forcesensitives in the area however kaan was unaware that the weapon would also kill the creators namely the sith lords of the brotherhood 10 the thought bomb in the aftermath of the seventh battle of ruusan cthe sith forces and the dark lords all retreated to a massive network of caves and gathered in the central chamber kaan using bane’s records led the ritual creating the thought bomb when confronted by a group of jedi led by lord hoth kaan detonated the bomb 10the brotherhood of darkness was destroyed 10rule of two edit edit darth bane’s reign edit edit early actions edit one of bane’s first actions in the aftermath of ruusan was to search out an apprentice he found his disciple in the form of the young girl zannah after terrorizing a group of surviving sith mercenaries to create easily discredited rumors of a surviving dark lord allowing the sith to remain hidden he tasked zannah with finding a way to onderon on her own as a test abandoning her on the ruusan battlefield bane departed for the planet himself 9 10 darth bane’s body is colonized by the orbalisks while he retrieves freedon nadd’s holocron chowever along the way he was suddenly accosted by the spirits of qordis and kaan both of whom had somehow found a way to escape the thought bomb provoked by them bane accidentally crippled his ship and crashlanded on the onderonian moon dxun wandering through the wilderness bane came upon the tomb of freedon nadd investigating it he managed to gain entry procuring nadd’s holocron however before he could exit the tomb he was attacked by a swarm of orbalisks that had colonized the tomb they latched themselves to his body but instead of parasitically feeding on it they instead fed upon his dark side energy the two formed a symbiotic relationship the orbalisks got to feast on bane’s energy sustaining themselves while they formed a set of nighimpervious bioorganic armor for him and they served as repositories of dark side energy that he could draw on at will 9 11using their power he dominated one of the dxun beasts to serve as his steed thanks to virtue of season bane had arrived on dxun during the period where the atmospheres of the moon and onderon overlapped pushing his steed to the limit bane made for onderon 9while bane fought through his ordeal on dxun zannah made her way to onderon by hijacking a republic vessel and killing the crew with a stolen blaster crashlanding on onderon she was ambushed by a clan of beastriders before they could kill her darth bane arrived the beastriders were slaughtered bane was impressed by zannah’s ability and officially made her his apprentice 9zannah’s apprenticeship edit darth bane and his apprentice darth zannah cdarth bane and zannah settled on ambia on the shores of lake natth a focus of dark side energy on the planet over the next decade bane trained zannah in the arts of patience secrecy and deception zannah herself developed a talent for sith sorcery becoming a skilled illusionist bane’s abilities as a duelist also rubbed off on zannah and she developed into a formidable combatant in her own right 9while he trained darth zannah bane utilized records stolen from the brotherhood of darkness to gain access to lord qordis’ bank accounts making off with the late sith lord’s considerable funds using these credits bane began manipulating galactic politics working through a variety of intermediates and middlemen bane began stirring up a variety of antirepublic terrorist organizations in order to distract the jedi from investigating sith rumors and keep the republic united ensuring that the sith only had a single target to focus on and to set the stage for the eventual sith takeover 9bane also dispatched zannah to infiltrate the anti republic liberation front one of the more prominent terrorist groups based on serenno zannah’s mission was successful and she brought about the groups destruction however she also gained the attention of the group’s reclusive leader hetton hetton was a serenno nobleman and selftaught sith acolyte when he discovered zannah’s identity as a sith lord he immediately begged her to make him her apprentice 9zannah seemingly agreed and took hetton and his entourage of sith assassins to ambria supposedly to assassinate darth bane bane easily held off the attack and killed hetton zannah then revealed to bane that the assassination attempt was a manipulation to eliminate hetton and test bane and that the ultimate goal had been gaining the possession of hetton’s collection of sith artifacts 9while they gained a massive number of sith equipment bane was still unsatisfied he had been seeking to create a holocron but had been repeatedly undone supposedly by the effects of the orbalisks who enhanced his rage and inhibited his concentration bane dispatched zannah to infiltrate the jedi temple and gain access to the archives so he might find a way to remove the orbalisks while zannah did this bane departed for tython to search out belia darzu’s fortress and her holocron 9near disaster on tython edit darth bane landed on tython and successfully infiltrated the fortress of belia darzu evading the still active defenses making his way to the central chamber he fought his way through her hordes of remaining technobeasts and retrieved her holocron studying the artifact he discovered that his failure at creating a holocron had been due to design flaws on his part rather than the orbalisks hindering his efforts while zannah sought out information on orbalisks in the jedi archives bane began to rethink his decision to remove them 9 darovit defecting to the sith during the war cwhile zannah successfully found the information she was looking for she also encountered her cousin darovit as children zannah and darovit had been recruited by the jedi to help in the ruusan campaign however their ship was shot down as they came in to land and the two were separated darovit had been found by the jedi though he shortly afterwards defected to the sith while zannah had wandered the wilderness for several days before being found by bane in the aftermath of ruusan darovit became the reclusive healing hermit devoting himself to helping ruusan recover from the war as a penance for his own actions 9when a republic construction team led by johun othone arrived on ruusan to construct a memorial to the battle darovit was enraged seeing this action as opening an old wound sabotaging their efforts darovit gained the attention of othone who pursued him back to his dwelling knowing that the game was up darovit surrendered as the two spoke darovit revealed the survival of the sith after the battle of ruusan darovit had encountered bane and zannah after the thought bombs detonation before they left zannah as a final act of mercy used the force to destroy darovit’s right hand disarming him but indirectly sparring his life as bane no longer saw him as a threat bane allowed him to live feeling that no one would believe the word of a traitor if darovit tried reporting the sith lords existence 9othone brought darovit to the jedi temple to testify before the jedi council however while othone set up an appointment with the council darovit encountered zannah in the archives while researching herbal lore zannah having found the information she needed abducted him and fled the planet however darovit’s absence was immediately noticed and othone managed to convince several masters to accompany him in pursuit of zannah however they had no time to inform any others of darth bane’s survival 9zannah met bane on tython with darovit in tow convincing bane to allow darovit to live as his abilities as a healer could aid them in removing the orbalisks they prepared to confront the jedi retreating to a large chamber deep in belia darzu’s fortress they stashed their artifacts and information in a small side room along with darovit and prepared to meet the jedi 9 darth bane in his orbalisk armor valenthyne farfalla and raskta lsu took bane and othone and sarro xaj attacked zannah while master worror dowmat held back and reinforced them with battle meditation despite dowmat’s aid the jedi were unable to bring down the dark lords bane’s orbalisk armor protecting him from their lightsaber strikes enabling him to focus solely on offense while zannah’s defensive technique proved adequate to hold off xaj whose efforts were being hindered by othone’s rusty skills however when othone broke off to attack bane xaj was able to take full advantage of his skills gaining ground on zannah 9bane attempting to halt the jedi’s advance attacked dowmat while farfalla managed to save dowmat from bane he also disrupted his battle meditation distracting the jedi and allowing zannah to slay xaj freed up to help bane zannah impaled lsu while bane decapitated farfalla and gouged out dowmat’s throats as bane prepared to execute othone with a blast of force lightning worror used the last of his strength to encase the dark lord in a force shield causing the lightning to backfire upon bane 9this revealed a major weakness in the orbalisks they were unable to withstand electrical bursts and were killed by the lightning as they died they released a toxic excretion into bane’s body that would leave him dead within days unless treated finishing othone herself zannah quickly loaded bane’s dying body onto their ship along with darovit and their gathered artifacts and information and rushed to ambria 9meeting with the healer caleb whom bane had earlier relied on when githany had poisoned him zannah attempted to extort him however caleb was unconcerned with any of zannah’s threats as his daughter was all that mattered to him and he had already sent her away while zannah despaired darovit convinced caleb to heal bane on the condition that zannah allow them to send a message to the jedi informing them of bane’s existence his location and his helpless state while darovit hoped the jedi would take zannah and bane into custody and allow zannah to redeem herself the sith apprentice had other ideas 9allowing them to send the message which was written and delivered by message drone zannah waited until they healed bane and then struck zannah dismembered caleb and used her abilities to drive darovit insane before hiding herself and bane the jedi arrived soon after and found caleb’s remains attacked by the maddened darovit they quickly brought him down assuming darovit to be the dark lord they believed that he had brought down the masters on tython singlehandedly but was wounded and his attempts to heal himself through the dark side backfired they believed that caleb had been killed by bane when he sought treatment and discovered that caleb had sent the message to the jedi collecting caleb’s remains for burial the jedi departed satisfied that the sith were finally defeated and glorified the encounter as the fall of darth bane 9 12later actions edit darth zannah during the latter stage of her apprenticeship bane’s efforts to construct a holocron would eventually come to fruition this artifact eventually finding its way into the possession of darth krayt though it would be of little use to him 13however as ten years passed zannah failed to make an attempt on bane’s life and the dark lord began to become concerned with her worthiness worried that she might be unable to succeed him bane set about searching for the long lost holocron of darth andeddu in the means for immortality 14however when bane gained the holocron and studied its immortal ways it was stolen by set harth who was once the apprentice of zannah while trying to help her kill bane bane then took an iktotchi assassin dubbed darth cognus but destroyed his own body from what he had read from andeddus holocron and seemingly placed himself in zannahs body cognus then apprenticed herself to darth zannah who was now the official dark lord of the sith eventually cognus would rise to take her mistress place and the rank of sith master 14darth cognus’ reign edit edit darth cognus was a member of the sith order who attained power from her mentor zannah as sith master she took as her apprentice an individual named millennial a threeeyed mutant human and a powerful forcesensitive 5millennial’s rebellion edit darth cognus cmillennial proved to be an able apprentice trained as a shadow hand by cognus and possessing powerful precognitive abilities however millennial and cognus disagreed on several points most notably on the continued application of the rule of two 5cognus was a staunch believer in the philosophy training millennial accordingly the mutant apprentice on the other hand believed the doctrine to be too restrictive instead supporting the more martial rule of the strong which tolerated the presence of numerous sith lords the leader being the strongest the two clashed many times over this issue and tensions eventually reached a boiling point 5cognus ended millennial’s training and cast him out whether this was a brutal execution attempt or a simple expulsion remains unknown but either way millennial fled while cognus took a new apprentice and continued the rule of two millennial settled on dromund kaas and founded the sith splinter cult known as dark force 5darth vectivus’ reign edit edit the man who eventually became darth vectivus started out as a simple businessman a shrewd but fairminded individual taking control of a mining operation near bimmiel he discovered that he was a latent forcesensitive and began feeling dark side energy permeating the mine as he researched and learned from these energies they also began adversely affecting the miners and contaminating the ore forcing him to close the facility 15as he was now freed up without needing to manage his business operation the man began journeying the galaxy seeking knowledge on the force he eventually came into contact with the order of the sith lords and was apprenticed becoming darth vectivus he managed to keep control of himself relying on his staunch ethical code to prevent becoming corrupted by the dark side becoming the sith master vectivus returned to the mine building a mansion on the sight and living out his life happily surrounded by family and friends 15vectivus remained an oddity among sith as he was not a powerhungry rage driven schemer but just an ordinary man 15darth plagueis’ reign edit edit darth sidious trains under darth plagueis cthe muun plagueis reigned around the time of 60 bby born on mygeeto as hego damask darth tenebrous known as rugess nome found him actually before he was born though it is also known that he was a mystic obsessed with immortality thanks to the longevity his species possessed he spent over a lifetime searching for such secrets they came in the form of the ability to manipulate the midichlorians within a being to prevent death and create life in the form of a spontaneously generated pregnancy 4 16sidious’ apprenticeship edit how plagueis came into contact with palpatine like his own origins remains unknown palpatine became darth sidious and spent the following few decades learning all his master knew however despite sidious’ power and skill plagueis remained unsatisfied with his pupil and began his penultimate experiment with his powers 4 16he planned to create a pregnancy within a woman that would result in the most powerful forcesensitive ever known however plagueis also foolishly informed sidious of his plans sidious realizing the ramifications of this assassinated plagueis the new dark lord also considered hunting down and killing the child but resolved to allow the youngling to live as such a powerful being could be useful at a future date 4 16darth sidious’ reign edit edit maul’s apprenticeship edit edit darth maul training under darth sidious cas with many things regarding darth sidious’ early years how he came in contact with darth maul remains largely unknown save for a few details sidious abducted the zabrak child who eventually became maul from his family on iridonia possibly before he even assassinated plagueis and trained him in the ways of the sith due to the martial prowess and hardiness of the zabrak species they were long a subject of interest to the sith empires of old these groups often spending ridiculous sums of money to hire zabrak mercenaries however nothing could have prepared maul for the brutal treatment he received from sidious 4 16maul was subjected to numerous physical tests and training regiments many of which bordered on torture the goal of this vicious treatment was to strip maul of his compassion and humility turning him into a ragefuelled sith killer in the end sidious achieved his goal and maul became a hardy and powerful sith lord who demonstrated great martial prowess 4as a final test sidious abandoned maul on a remote and isolated world where he was relentlessly hunted by his assassin droids after leaving him to survive for a month sidious confronted the zabrak and challenged him despite maul’s best efforts he was defeated and sidious taunted that he had trained a new apprentice during the interim period a replacement for maul the enraged zabrak resumed fighting with renewed vigor and even though he was defeated he still passed sidious’ test 17darth sidious declared his apprentice’s training complete and dubbed him “darth maul” dark lord of the sith however despite his success with this pupil sidious regarded him as little more than a placeholder for his eventual target 4 16 17the phantom menace edit edit senator palpatine  cwhile sidious trained maul he also set about preparing for the ultimate revenge of the sith using his alter ego palpatine sidious infiltrated the halls of power starting as a relatively lowlevel politician on his native naboo and worked his way up sidious ensured that his rise was relatively slow rather than an alarming meteoric rise to power that would attract his enemy’s attention in 52 bby palpatine had the current chommell sector senator vidar kim assassinated his complicity in the killing was never discovered as the assassin committed suicide while being interrogated by kim’s jedi son ronhar in a demonstration of his cunning palpatine befriended ronhar kim during the latesenator kim’s funeral gaining a contact and an unwitting pawn palpatine would use ronhar kim in a scheme that resulted in the creation of the red guard and kim’s death during the clone wars would be used a propaganda to further palpatine’s power grab 18with vidar kim out of the way palpatine assumed his place in the galactic senate of the republic many of the powerbrokers and coruscanti politicians looked down on provincial delegates like palpatine believing such hopefuls would be overwhelmed by the complexity and enormity of galactic politics palpatine encouraged this opinion as it made him harder to notice thusly less threatening however palpatine’s quiet position gained him many friends within the senate and he became increasingly popular he was also an avid writer and many of palpatine’s publications and theories about political science were taught at leading universities however despite palpatine’s fame and popularity he remained unassuming devoting all his time to his work and to furthering his sith agenda part of sidious preparation for his own ultimate rise was to engineer the assassination of the trade federation directorate thanks to his contact and ally wilhuff tarkin the directorate was destroyed in a pirate raid on eraidu where they had gathered for a summit this allowed for the neimodians to take advantage of the situation and take over the federation the new leader of the corporation was the viceroy nute gunray  once this was done palpatine supported the senate resolution br0371 which caused many of the galactic trade routes to have taxes levied on them the trade federation was outraged and was approached by darth sidious in short order sidious encouraged the neimodians to retaliate having them blockade naboo in protest the naboo crisis edit at last we will reveal ourselves to the jedi at last we will have revenge ― darth maul — 34 listen  file info srcall the pieces were now in place palpatine heavily influenced both the supreme chancellor of the republic finis valorum and the current monarch of naboo padmé amidala and sidious had direct control over the timid leaders of the trade federation everything that transpired did so according to his design the blockade of naboo kick started uproar in the senate but as the trade federation had broken no laws the judicial department could not act the senate’s stalling weakened valorum’s hold on power however surprisingly palpatine was unable to completely rein in amidala as he had expected and she contacted valorum directly holding him personally responsible for the crisis 19valorum panicked backed into a corner by his own morality and desperate to shore up support he contacted the jedi council the council sent jedi master quigon jinn and his apprentice obiwan kenobi to naboo as ambassadors to resolve the issue the jedi landed aboard the trade federation flagship in orbit above naboo and waited to meet with gunray and his aides darth sidious was enraged by this new development ordering them to proceed with the invasion and have the jedi killed as the neimodians could simply deny the jedi’s presence however jinn and kenobi managed to escape the dioxisflooded conference room fighting their way to the bridge entrance they attempted to force their way in but were driven off by the trade federation destroyer droids the jedi managed to escape the ship aboard the trade federation invasion craft 19 darth maul confronts quigon jinn on tatooine  cwhile the invasion itself proceeded splendidly the jedi managed to make contact with amidala and her entourage spiriting them offplanet however as they escaped their ship was damaged and they were forced to detour to tatooine to make repairs sidious was truly alarmed by this sending maul to tatooine to retrieve the queen and also to prevent the jedi from interfering with his potential replacement anakin skywalker however despite maul’s efforts he was unsuccessful amidala and the jedi managed to escape tatooine taking anakin skywalker with them 19the continued existence of the sith and their involvement in the crisis was revealed 19the jedi and the queen managed to make it to coruscant where amidala met with the senate while anakin skywalker was taken before the jedi council palpatine manipulated amidala into calling for a vote of noconfidence in chancellor valorum bringing about a senate election in accordance with his plan palpatine used the blockade of naboo to take advantage of the sympathy vote backing up his own popularity while palpatine went about his political machinations the jedi debated over whether or not to accept the incredibly potent but drastically overaged anakin skywalker for training a heated issue that added to the tension caused by the revelation of the siths continued existence ultimately the issue was stalled when queen amidala rashly decided to return to naboo in an attempt to wrest control back from the trade federation jinn and kenobi were sent to accompany her with skywalker in tow 19the battle of naboo edit edit when amidala arrived on naboo she used the gungan exile jar jar binks who had joined her entourage before they fled the planet to make contact with the gungan leadership making amends with the gungans whom the humans on naboo have been tense with for centuries she convinced them to mobilize their army to attack the trade federation droid forces while the battle of naboo commenced amidala and the jedi led a strike team into the naboo capital to abduct viceroy gunray and dispatch naboo’s air force to attack the trade federation flagship in orbit as it controlled the droid armies that made up the corporations entire force 19 darth mauls defeat at the hands of obiwan kenobi chowever as the team prepared to exit the hangar after rallying the air force they were confronted by darth maul as the jedi broke off to take the sith lord the team took an alternate exit as this all took place anakin skywalker took refuge in the cockpit of one of the naboo fighters accidentally activating the autopilot and going off to join the space battle 19it seemed that the trade federation and the sith were going to be victorious in the struggle amidala was captured and taken before gunray the gungan forces were routed and captured the naboo air force suffered heavy casualties and maul managed to kill quigon jinn obiwan kenobi fell on the sith lord in a blind fury but was ultimately brought down by him though not killed however amidala managed to gain access to a hidden weapons cache in the throne room taking gunray hostage anakin skywalker managed to land within the trade federation flagship destroying the reactor before escaping and kenobi managed to get hold of jinn’s lightsaber using it to wound maul 19ultimately none of these events proved to be setbacks palpatines ultimate goal of gaining the chancellorship was achieved even mauls apparent death was of little importance sidious sent him to naboo with full knowledge of his eventual fate thanks to his own precognitive powers maul had been a capable apprentice but he had outlived his usefulness and was ill suited to the coming tasks 4unknown to sidious and the jedi maul had survived and had been hiding in lotho minor for over a decide succumbing to madness until his brother savage opress found him 20 and brought him home to dathomir to be cured 21in the aftermath of the battle the trade federation leaders were taken to coruscant for trial though sidious manipulations ensured that they never came to a verdict relations between the naboo humans and the native gungans improved considerably with the two cooperating on numerous projects and public works and anakin skywalker was accepted for jedi training his actions in the battle convincing the jedi council that he had the force on his side 4consolidation edit edit chancellor palpatine sidious was quick to eliminate any evidence of his involvement in the battle republic investigators claimed maul’s ship and equipment but their bungled efforts to examine them resulted in their selfdestruction after the burned out wreck received a more careful examination by jedi master saesee tiin he recommended that it be placed in the care of the jedi council however representatives from kuat lobbied for the opportunity to study it and the ship disappeared on its way to a kuat facility 4with these loose ends tied up sidious set about laying the foundations for the coming clone wars and enacting several other minor schemes to whittle away the jedi ranks little by little moving into the chancellor’s suite in the republic executive building palpatine redecorated the office to suit his own tastes hiding many priceless sith artifacts in plain sight as many were too obscure to be recognized also palpatine required a personal detachment of body guards but he could not be seen actively creating one so he instead created a situation where they were apparently forced on him while speaking with his unwitting pawn ronhar kim he had several members of his senate guard detachment attempt to assassinate him kim fended them off and the survivors committed suicide on the spot however the damage was done and the red guard was created 18when his first term ended palpatine ensured that no opposing candidates rose up while keeping his own image spotless this would be the last election in the history of the republic with a constitutional amendment near the end of his second term allowing him to serve indefinitely the new apprentice edit edit sidious new apprentice cwhile darth maul was ill suited for the tasks needed palpatine still required an apprentice however he could not simply train a new one from infancy as he had done with maul as neglecting his political career for his sith duties could prove disastrous and anakin skywalker was not yet a viable option he examined several potential candidates such as the jedi vergere and dooku after vergere attempted to assassinate him and fled palpatine settled on dooku dooku proved best suited for what sidious had in mind a powerful jedi master and a highly skilled duelist dooku was also known as a maverick and a political activist having left the jedi order in the wake of the battle of naboo dooku was also a free agent sidious approached him and after long hours of discussion convinced the exjedi to join him as a test of dooku’s commitment sidious set him after his old friend and colleague from the jedi master sifodyas dyas anticipating the coming chaos had contracted the cloners on kamino to create a clone army while sidious planned to seize control of this army he couldn’t allow dyas to survive dooku killed him 22dooku was officially brought into the sith fold bestowed with the name darth tyranus 22instigating the clone wars edit edit the clone army an important factor of sidiouss plan darth tyranus then returns to the jedi archives where he erases several starsystems from the maps most importantly kamino and stealing information about several hyperspace lanes in the deep core although no longer a jedi himself the next thing darth sidious needed to settle was whose dna would be used to produce the new clone army at the same time another problem had presented itself for the bora gora cult had returned and sidious believed they had enough influence to endanger his plans sidious ordered tyranus to deal with these problems and dooku obliged putting a bounty of five million credits over the leader of the cult komari vosa and leaving the job to the bounty hunter to finish her off dooku also planned to ask the successful bounty hunter to be the model for the new clone army knowing that several powerful mercenaries would seek to achieve the considerable bounty jango fett a mandalorian bounty hunter was able to defeat komari vosa at the moon kohlma and was going to spare her life when dooku appeared and killed her himself dooku then told jango fett that he wanted him to be the basis for the clone army at a later meeting dooku tried to make jango speak more about his past the bounty hunter not trusting dooku because he was once a jedi tried to increase his payment by infecting the sith lord with a biological weapon dooku pretended to be defeated but convinced jango to tell the rest of his story after fett finished dooku healed himself with the force eliminating jangos advantage jango finally submitted allowing himself to be cloned on the condition of having an unaltered clone to be his son later dooku supported kharis fenn when he tried to take power on planet ryloth he did this believing that under kharis rhyloth would secede from the republic when the clone wars began in order to gain leverage fenn kidnapped nat secura son of lon secura who was khariss enemy a jedi master named tholme attempted to rescue nat but was captured himself and was only spared because dooku believed he could use tholme at a later date unfortunately for dooku two more jedi arrived quinlan vos and aayla secura and they managed to rescue nat and stop kharis fenn from gaining control of rhyloth although dookus plans failed the jedi had absolutely no clue he was involved dooku also assisted the trade federation when they tried to eliminate the army that served the wookiee trade guild since the guild refused to pay taxes to the federation because no wookiees survived the battle dookus involvement was unknown to the jedi dooku and his master continued to plot the war against the rebublic and decided to use the trade federation and other corporations in order to make a large enough rift in the galaxy darth sidious decided that the general to be behind the separatist army should be the kaleesh warrior grievous and sent dooku to retrieve him creating the confederacy and stirring the senate edit grievous general of the confederacy cdooku spoke to san hill of the inter galactic banking clan for he knew that grievous was last hired by them together they made a plan to cripple the commander and rebuild him as a cyborg an ion bomb was planted on grievous’s shuttle and his seat rigged so that when the bomb went off the kaleeshan would be ejected after the craft crashed dooku found a gravely injured grievous and transported him to geonosis there the kaleeshan was made into a cyborg that would be perfect for the clone wars with the combined power of his tactical genius the sith were very happy with the new grievous and only more so after dooku trained him to be an expert lightsaber duelist the droid armies now had a general a position that dooku did not want for himself dooku then commandeered a communications station and delivered a speech that greatly criticized the republic he then asked several systems to secede from the government and to join his separatist movement some planets did indeed listen to his speech and in some cases they built up private armies against the republic though it had not yet reached open war because of this darth sidious as chancellor palpatine was allowed to keep his position which canceled the next election he then offered to make a fake peaceful meeting with dooku but it had been planned beforehand by the sith dooku did not reply which made the separatists look like they could not be bargained with palpatine then tried to make an army for the republic and set out to get the military creation act approved he used a number of debates and even assassinations to show the inadequacy of the jedi and the need for an army although he publicly looked as if he had taken no side on the issue the clone wars begin edit edit jango fett the clone template and the clone army behind him calthough everything was prepared for the clone wars dooku had run into a few complications the fondor shipyards were critical to the siths plans but three conspirators groodo rodd and hurlo holowan sought to destroy them dooku managed to stop them by once again hiring jango fett and after the trio was brought to him they agreed to work for the sith lord count dooku then recruited scientist jenna zan arbor to the separatist cause and she became one of the leading scientists for the cis dooku then tried to bolster the separatists by trying to make the planet ansion secede from the republic for it was the basis of several minor alliances including the malarian alliance if ansion left the republic other systems would follow suit dooku left this to be done by commerce guild shu mai who gave a considerable amount of support to ansions government the unity of community making it consider joining the separatist the plan failed due to the intervention of jedi obiwan kenobi and luminara unduli as well as their padawans anakin skywalker and barriss offee dooku later explained to shu mai that the secession of ansion was not neccesary to the confederacys success although darth tyranus had gathered a large number of allies around him one of the most powerful nute gunray was not pleased he was still very sore over his losing of naboo and demanded dooku to kill padme amidala who he believed was the source of his worries dooku once again hired jango fett to assassinate the senator but the bounty hunter in turn paid zam wesell to do it for him before zam was able to succeed the jedi obiwan kenobi and his padawan anakin skywalker captured him but jango managed to both kill wesell and escape obiwan then traced the weapon jango had used a kamino saberdart back to the planet kamino when kenobi arrived on kamino he found not only fett but the fully grown clone army ready to be deployed jango fled kamino to geonosis where a meeting between dooku and all of the separatist leaders was taking place they were finally forming the confederacy of independent systems a government that would stand against the republic this would be made up an alliance between the corporate alliance geonosian industries the commerce guild the techno union the inter galactic banking clan and the trade federation obiwan though had pursued fett to geonosis and witnessed the meeting he then attempted to contact the jedi council but was captured by the geonosians and was imprisoned in a containment field which kept him totally incapacitated the senate had indeed received obiwans message but palpatine planned to use it for his own purposes he showed the message to the jedi who agreed he should be given emergency powers representative jar jar binks then volunteered to speak his mind to the senate and his speech to the many senators was shocking for they had believed him to be a total buffoon the majority of the senate instantly agreed with the representative and the power to make a military was finally given to darth sidious arena bloodbath edit the jedi attempting to hold off the droid ambush cchancellor palpatine finally enlisted the clones to be the grand army of the republic jedi master yoda himself went to retrieve the clones while a jedi taskforce was sent to rescue obiwan kenobi at the same time count dooku decided to interrogate kenobi himself dooku used drain knowledge on the captive jedi searching for areas for him to be turned to the dark side the sith lord attempted to turn obiwan by saying the republic was corrupt and that kenobis old master quigon jinn would have joined him if he was still alive kenobi denied him and said that dooku was a traitor darth tyranus finally gave up and left the jedi in his cell anakin skywalker and padme amidala arrived in an effort to rescue obiwan but were then captured themselves count dooku offered the senator freedom if she supported the separatists but she refused the two jedi and amidala were then sentenced to death in the arena the petranaki arena was packed with geonosian spectators and count dooku jango fett and other separatist leaders watched from a high balcony three monsters an acklay a reek and a nexu were released to devour the victims finally the jedi geonosis strike team arrived jedi master mace windu confronted darth tyranus but was chased off by jango who fought down in the arena dooku was not surprised by the jedis ambush and revealed that the captives he had were just bait for a trap 10000 battledroids were waiting for the attack including a large number of geonosian warriors the new separatist droid army quickly overwhelmed the jedi and many of them would die while lord tyranus watched from the balcony the clones attack edit yoda and dooku dueling ccount dooku did not join the battle but jedi master coleman trebor attempted to challenge the sith lord he was unable to actually engage dooku for jango managed to kill the jedi before a duel commenced after the jedi had taken significant losses darth tyranus ordered his droids to cease fire he then asked mace windu to surrender which was refused suddenly master yoda arrived with the clone army in tow the jedi had taken control of the clones without knowing that was exactly what darth sidious had wanted the battledroids attacked again but the reinforcements allowed the jedi to escape from the arena outside of the arena an even larger force of clones was engaging the separatist army the battle of geonosis was heavily tipped to the side of the republic and the separatists were in full retreat the confederacys leaders regrouped at the geonosian command center and decided to abandon the planet tyranus pretended he knew nothing of the clone army and poggle the lesser ordered his geonosion warriors to hide underneath the stalgasin hive but not before handing the plans to the ds1 orbital battle station to his master dooku was now free to leave the planet and retreated to his hangar where he prepared his solar sailor he was then attacked by the jedi obiwan kenobi and anakin skywalker but managed to defeat both of them before he was able to either kill them or to fly away a last jedi confronted him…yoda although dooku used both his force abilities and his dueling skills he was unable to do more than hold off the jedi masters onslaught in an attempt to distract yoda he tipped a massive column with the force wich fell towards kenobi and skywalker who were still unable to move yoda broke off the battle to save the two allowing the sith lord to escape in his solar sailor darth tyranus then arrived on coruscent where he met with darth sidious himself at the works dooku informed palpatine that the clone wars had begun and his master was pleased early conflicts in the clone wars edit edit after reporting to his master dooku traveled to his secret base on bakura hoping to regroup the separatist forces unfortunately for him this move was expected by jedi tholme and sora bulq the pair confronted dooku hoping to defeat a sith still tired from the attack on geonosis the trio began a vicious duel in which dooku used force lightning to defeat bulq he then attempted to bring tholme over to the dark side but the jedi refused dooku then brought down the roof on tholme presuming him dead the sith lord

species of redskinned humanoids native to ziost and korriban that were enslaved by exiled dark jedi prior to their discovery the sith were divided into a meek and lowly slave class a skilled and intelligent engineer class and the warlike massassi class over time the sith interbred with the human dark jedi through the practice of sith alchemy and the two peoples became one massassi the massassi were a sith subspecies under the rule of the exiled dark jedi many massassi captives were subject to sith alchemy which resulted in them being more deadly and easier for their sith masters to

― kreia srcthe sith empire was temporarily resurrected by the fallen jedi revan and malak built upon a hardened core of veterans from the mandalorian wars and a host of jedi converts the fledgling new galactic power very nearly succeeded in conquering the republic during the jedi civil war after the redemption of darth revan and the death of darth malak their empire splintered into factions and eventually collapsed sith triumvirate the sith triumvirate was a brief but deadly sith order founded by the former jedi kreia now known as darth traya she took two apprentices of unknown origins and trained many new sith at the trayus academy on malachor v after her exile from the triumvirate the two remaining sith lords darth nihilus and darth sion executed the first jedi purge the sith triumvirate was a loose alliance of what remained of darth revans sith empire it was solidified sometime after the battle of rakata prime this organization comprised several if not hundreds of sith apprentices sith masters and most importantly sith assassins the members were eventually defeated by the jedi exile  new sith empire the new sith empire was founded by darth ruin and was the vast area of galactic territory formed out of the fourth great schism which the sith ruled over with an iron fist its capital was the planet roon at its height during the new sith wars it was almost as good as the old sith empires of naga sadow and darth revan following the battle of mizra and during the republic dark age it encompassed a great percentage of the known galaxy sometime between 1010 and 1006 bby the new sith empire collapsed in a civil war from the ashes kaan established the brotherhood of darkness  brotherhood of darkness founded by lord kaan the brotherhood of darkness sometimes referred to as the dark army was the last mass gathering of the sith for nearly 1200 years an army of over twenty thousand sith lords and their followers its destruction on ruusan heralded the beginning of a new order  order of the sith lords under the last surviving sith lord of that army darth bane a new sith order was created as a result of the devastating seventh battle of ruusan which saw the annihilation of the previous sith order banes sith order known formally as the order of the sith lords was founded upon the principles of darth revan s holocron where from he formed the rule of two utilizing stealth tactics and treachery to achieve their means the rule of two would allow his eventual successor darth sidious to finally triumph over the jedi and the galactic republic nearly 1000 years later disciples of ragnos the disciples of ragnos was a sith cult under the leadership of tavion axmis who sought to resurrect the spirit of marka ragnos through ancient sith sorcery and take control of the galaxy the cult was closely related to the empire reborn movement of which tavion had herself been part with the dark jedi desann the cult was ultimately defeated by jaden korr and the new jedi order  lumiyas sith lumiya s sith were a loosely collected group of individuals associated with lumiya selfproclaimed dark lady of the sith after the final death of darth sidious even with palpatines final death the sith continued to survive their next sith lord was an emperors hand named lumiya darth vader had passed on to lumiya some sith teaching secretly from his master and the woman adopted the title dark lady of the sith upon her masters death at endor she trained two apprentices flint who was redeemed by vaders son luke skywalker and carnor jax who was killed by palpatine loyalist kir kanos  soon afterwards she succeeded in convincing vaders grandson jacen solo to join the ranks of the sith thus calling himself darth caedus darth caedus later corrupted the jedi tahiri veila and took her as his apprentice however following the death of caedus and the redemption of his apprentice the war lumiya had started was over and lumiyas sith had perished one sith by the year 130 aby a new sith order had risen to take the place of darth bane s order it is known that a sith known as darth krayt began the order on korriban the ancient sith burial world around 30 aby in this new sith cult many of the followers sported a redandblack tattooed appearance and used lightsabers with an yorik coralstyled hilt design this sith order was considered heretical by the sith of the past krayt spent over a century growing and strengthening the new order planning to unify the galaxy once more under sith rule he and his new order made their presence known around 127  130 aby by initiating the sith–imperial war and then launching an attack on the jedi on ossus ranks edit edit we take what we desire because we can  we can because we have power  we have power because we are sith ―sith proverb srcthe sith had a clearly defined hierarchy which divided the strong from the weak but because the sith order existed in numerous disparate incarnations the sith hierarchy did not maintain a single continuous ranking system throughout its history the sith hierarchy remained much the same for almost 6000 years  through the ancient sith empire exar kuns brotherhood of the sith and darth revans sith empire  until lord kaan declared that all of his highest ranking followers in the brotherhood of darkness were dark lords of the sith like the jedi and the old republic the sith underwent a great reformation after the apocalyptic final battle of ruusan the sith orders destruction inspired darth bane to reform the order and decree that there would be only two sith at a time from that point forward a master and an apprentice both would bear the title dark lord of the sith which would become synonymous with the term sith lord sith empire edit edit these were the ranks of the sith order before darth bane instituted the rule of two  dark lord of the sith darth sidious a dark lord of the sith cdark lords of the sith were the greatest and most powerful of the sith lords up until the reign of kaan it was a title that was only given to those that were acknowledged as the leaders of their order but by the end of the new sith wars the title was held by many sith lords simultaneously sith lord sith lords were the leaders of the sith they commanded armies of sith minions acolytes and warriors during wartime and ruled through a governing body known as the sith council sith lords used the dark side of the force to inflict misery suffering and corruption they were also tasked with preserving the lore of the sith by passing all their knowledge on to their acolytes while they did not enter combat as often as lesser sith preferring to use pawns servants or proxies they were the most fearsome of the sith as they were the keepers of the siths greatest secrets and wielders of its most potent sorceries sith marauder sith marauders a variant of the sith warriors were often responsible for the most brutal acts carried out by the sith their training emphasized the aggressive use of a lightsaber rather than the force a sith marauders berserk physical prowess was a dark side technique fueled by hatred rage and cruelty thus most marauders could duel an average jedi toetotoe and win easily caring little for the subtleties of manipulating others and lacking a deep understanding of the force marauders were often burdened with carrying out the wishes of the sith lords sith warrior sith warrior was a rank of the sith order before darth banes reform of the sith order they were midranking sith who generally focused their energies and skills towards battle spending little time on actual dark side philosophy or other concerns of the purer sith sith acolyte sith acolyte were forcesensitive apprentices who had only just started down the dark path under the tutelage of a more experienced sith sith adept sith adept was a sith rank during the new sith wars similar to sith acolyte the brotherhood of darkness trained them in the dathomir academy and iridonia academy sith assassin a sith assassin specialized sith minions included sith assassins who preferred to ambush targets from the shadows rather than engaging them in standard combat almost always working solo or in small groups they utilized stealth field generators and the rare art of force camouflage to launch surprise attacks on their jedi victims while some used a lightsaber most fought with more conventional melee weapons such as force pikes darth traya darth sion and darth nihilus commanded legions of sith assassins during the aftermath of the jedi civil war causing the nearextermination of the jedi order the sith assassins drew their powers from the force power of their enemies sith minion sith minions were the lowliest members of the sith some were not even forcesensitive and often worshiped the sith lords as gods sith cultists sith assassins and sith marauders can be considered examples of sith minions however the sith also used soldiers mercenaries and conscripts to work for them postbane edit edit the postbane sith lords darth sidious and darth vader  two there should be no more no less one to embody power the other to crave it ―darth bane srcto ensure the continued survival of the sith bane was forced to put them on the brink of extinction he instituted the rule of two in banes order both sith held the title dark lord of the sith the rule of the two instituted that a master train an apprentice once the apprentice was fully trained he would kill the master and take on the mantle himself and repeat the process the death of the master is either a ceremonial killing or an assassination sith master sith masters were sith lords that had an apprentice serving beneath them other than bane notable sith masters include darth zannah darth

darth millennial darth maul darth tyranus and darth vader  dark side adepts dark side adepts were not technically sith these forcesensitives were chosen and honed by the sith apprentice essentially adepts were candidates to replace the apprentice when he or she was killed or ascended to mastery notables included darth tyranus s dark acolytes whose numbers included sora bulq and the infamous

need for functionaries throughout the empire who were to one extent or another supporters if not adherents of the dark side though not sith in any strict sense these quasisith minions were known generally as dark side adepts as forcesensitive individuals serving the emperor they supported his sith rule by working in the roles of servants agents intelligence operatives military officials etc dark side adepts were particularly important when palpatine was reborn into his clone bodies six years after his death inquisitorius the inquisitorius was a secret division of imperial intelligence consisting of dark side forcesensitive agents known as inquisitors sometimes also as inquisitioners or truth officers under the control of darth vader these inquisitors were considered the highest ranking of the dark side adepts outranking the emperors hands prophets of the dark side and lesser dark jedi they reported directly to emperor palpatine prophets of the dark side darth vader in his

protect and serve the emperor directly force sensitivity was by no means a requirement those with advanced talents however were assigned as sovereign protectors and those with even more advanced talents underwent force training under dark jedi tutors dark jedi although the name might imply otherwise dark jedi were not synonymous with sith although darth vader among others used techniques drawn from the traditions of both the dark jedi and the sith dark jedi were distinguished from the sith in the fact that dark jedi just used the dark side whereas the sith abided by the religion and codes passed down through the holocrons it was much more likely for dark jedi to return to the light eg kam solusar  other notable dark jedi included joruus cbaoth and jerec  legacy era edit edit lost
