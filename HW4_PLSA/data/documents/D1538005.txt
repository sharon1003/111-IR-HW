ors glucosesalt solution me sh d005440e medicine 906999treatment  edit on wikidataoral rehydration therapy  ort is a type of fluid replacement used to prevent and treat dehydration especially that due to diarrhea 1 it involves drinking water with modest amounts of sugar and salts specifically sodium and potassium 1 oral rehydration therapy can also be given by a nasogastric tube 1 therapy should routinely include the use of zinc supplements 1 use of oral rehydration therapy decreases the risk of death from diarrhea by about 93 2side effects may include vomiting high blood sodium or high blood potassium 1 if vomiting occurs it is recommended that use be paused for 10 minutes and then gradually restarted 1 the recommended formulation includes sodium chloride sodium citrate potassium chloride and glucose 1 glucose may be replaced by sucrose and sodium citrate may be replaced by sodium bicarbonate if not available 1 it works as glucose increases the uptake of sodium and thus water by the intestines 3 a number of other formulations are also available including versions that can be made at home 3 2 however the use of homemade solutions has not been well studied 2oral rehydration therapy was developed in the 1940s but did not come into common use until the 1970s 4 oral rehydration solution is on the world health organizations list of essential medicines the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system 5 the wholesale cost in the developing world of a package to mix with a liter of water is 003 to 020 usd 6 globally as of 2015 oral rehydration therapy is used by 41 of children with diarrhea 7 this use has played an important role in reducing the number of deaths in children under the age of five 7contents  hide 1 medical uses11 efficacy12 treatment algorithm2

replacement mild to moderate dehydration in children seen in an emergency department is best treated with ort persons taking ort should eat within 6 hours and return to their full diet within 24–48 hours 8oral rehydration therapy may also be used as a treatment for the symptoms of dehydration and rehydration in burns in resourcelimited settings 9efficacy  editort may lower the mortality rate of diarrhea by as much as 93 2 case studies in 4 developing countries also demonstrated an association between increased use of ort and reduction in mortality 10treatment algorithm  editthe degree of dehydration should be assessed before initiating ort ort is suitable for people who are not dehydrated and those who show signs and symptoms of mild to moderate dehydration people who have severe dehydration should seek professional medical help immediately and receive intravenous rehydration as soon as possible to rapidly replenish fluid volume in the body 11contraindications  editort should be discontinued and fluids replaced intravenously when vomiting is protracted despite proper administration of ort signs of dehydration worsen despite giving ort the person is unable to drink due to a decreased level of consciousness or there is evidence of intestinal blockage or ileus ort might also be contraindicated in people who are in hemodynamic shock due to impaired airway protective reflexes 12 shortterm vomiting is not a contraindication to receiving oral rehydration therapy in persons who are vomiting drinking oral rehydration solution at a slow and continuous pace will help the vomiting to resolve 8preparation  editexamples of commercially available oral rehydration salts on the left from nepal on the right from peru examples of commercially available ors mixing into water who and unicef jointly have developed official guidelines for the manufacture of oral rehydration solution and the oral rehydration salts used to make it both often abbreviated as ors they also describe acceptable alternative preparations depending on material availability commercial preparations are available as either preprepared fluids or packets of oral rehydration salts ready for mixing with water 13 14the formula for the current who oral rehydration solution also known as lowosmolar ors or reducedosmolarity ors is 26 grams 0092 oz salt na cl 29 grams 010 oz trisodium citrate dihydrate  c 6h 5na 3o 7⋅2h 2o  15 grams 0053 oz potassium chloride  kcl  135 grams 048 oz anhydrous glucose  c 6h 12o 6 per litre of fluid 15a basic oral rehydration therapy solution can also be prepared when packets of oral rehydration salts are not available it can be made using 6 level teaspoons 252 grams of sugar and 05 teaspoon 29 grams of salt in 1 litre of water 16 17 the molar ratio of sugar to salt should be 11 and the solution should not be hyperosmolar 18 the rehydration project states making the mixture a little diluted with more than 1 litre of clean water is not harmful 19the optimal fluid for preparing oral rehydration solution is clean water however if this is not available the usually available water should be used oral rehydration solution should not be withheld simply because the available water is potentially unsafe rehydration takes precedence 20when oral rehydration salts packets and suitable teaspoons for measuring sugar and salt are not available who has recommended that homemade gruels soups etc may be considered to help maintain hydration 21 a lancet review in 2013 emphasized the need for more research on appropriate home made fluids to prevent dehydration 22 sports drinks are not optimal oral rehydration solutions but they can be used if optimal choices are not available they should not be withheld for lack of better options rehydration takes precedence but they are not replacements for oral rehydration solutions in nonemergency situations 23reducedosmolarity oral rehydration salts  editunicefwho oral rehydration salt ors packet in 2003 who and unicef recommended that the osmolarity of oral rehydration solution be reduced from 311 to 245 m osml  24 these guidelines were also updated in 2006 this recommendation was based on multiple clinical trials showing that the reduced osmolarity solution reduces stool volume in children with diarrhea by about twentyfive percent and the need for iv therapy by about thirty percent when compared to standard oral rehydration solution the incidence of vomiting is also reduced the reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution has lower concentrations of glucose and sodium chloride than the original solution but the concentrations of potassium and citrate are unchanged 25 26 27 28 29the reduced osmolarity solution has been criticized by some for not providing enough sodium for adults with cholera 30 clinical trials have however shown reduced osmolarity solution to be effective for adults and children with cholera 29 they seem to be safe but some caution is warranted according to the cochrane review 29administration  editort is based on evidence that water continues to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract even while fluid is lost through diarrhea or vomiting the world health organization specify indications preparations and procedures for ort 20whounicef guidelines suggest ort should begin at the first sign of diarrhea in order to prevent dehydration 31 32 babies may be given ors with a dropper or a syringe infants under two may be given a teaspoon of ors fluid every one to two minutes older children and adults should take frequent sips from a cup who recommends giving children under two a quarter to a halfcup of fluid following each loose bowel movement and older children a half to a full cup if the person vomits the caretaker should wait 5–10 minutes and then resume giving ors 20  section 42 ors may be given by aid workers or health care workers in refugee camps health clinics and hospital settings 33 mothers should remain with their children and be taught how to give ors this will help to prepare them to give ort at home in the future breastfeeding should be continued throughout ort 20associated therapies  editzinc  editas part of oral rehydration therapy who recommends supplemental zinc 10 to 20 mg daily for ten to fourteen days to reduce the severity and duration of the illness and make recurrent illness in the following two to three months less likely preparations are available as a zinc sulfate solution for adults a modified solution for children and in tablet form 34feeding  editfeeding the person after severe dehydration is corrected and appetite returns speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function minimizes weight loss and supports continued growth in children small frequent meals are best tolerated offering the child food every three to four hours mothers should continue to breastfeed 20 35 36 a child with watery diarrhea typically regains his or her appetite as soon as dehydration is corrected whereas a child with bloody diarrhea often eats poorly until the illness resolves such children should be encouraged to resume normal feeding as soon as possible once diarrhea is corrected who recommends giving the child an extra meal each day for two weeks and longer if the child is malnourished 20children with malnutrition  editdehydration may be overestimated in wasted children and underestimated in edematous children 37 care of these children must also include careful management of their malnutrition and treatment of other infections useful signs of dehydration include an eagerness to drink lethargy cool and moist extremities weak or absent radial pulse wrist and reduced or absent urine flow in children with severe malnutrition it is often impossible to reliably distinguish between moderate and severe dehydration a severely malnourished child who has signs of severe dehydration but who does not have a history of watery diarrhea should be treated for septic shock 20the original ors 90 mmol sodiuml and the current standard reducedosmolarity ors 75 mmol sodiuml both contain too much sodium and too little potassium for severely malnourished children with dehydration due to diarrhea re so mal  re hydration so lution for mal nutrition is recommended for such children it contains less sodium 45 mmoll and more potassium 40 mmoll than reduced osmolarity ors 38it can be obtained in packets produced by unicef or other manufacturers an exception is if the severely malnourished child also has severe diarrhea in which case re so mal may not provide enough sodium in which case standard reducedosmolarity ors 75 mmol sodiuml is recommended 20 malnourished children should be rehydrated slowly who recommends 10 milliliters of re so mal per kilogram body weight for each of the first two hours for example a 9kilogram child should be given 90 ml of re so mal over the course of the first hour and another 90 ml for the second hour and then continuing at this same rate or slower based on the childs thirst and ongoing stool losses keeping in mind that a severely dehydrated child may be lethargic if the child drinks poorly a nasogastric tube should be used the iv route should not be used for rehydration except in cases of shock and then only with care infusing slowly to avoid flooding the circulation and overloading the heart 20feeding should usually resume within 2–3 hours after starting rehydration and should continue every 2–3 hours day and night for an initial cereal diet before a child regains his or her full appetite who recommends combining 25 grams skimmed milk powder 20 grams vegetable oil 60 grams sugar and 60 grams rice powder or other cereal into 1000 milliliters water and boiling gently for five minutes give 130 ml per kilogram of body weight during per 24 hours a child who cannot or will not eat this minimum amount should be given the diet by nasogastric tube divided into six equal feedings later on the child should be given cereal made with a greater amount of skimmed milk product and vegetable oil and slightly less sugar as appetite fully returns the child should be eating 200 ml per kilogram of body weight per day zinc potassium vitamin a and other vitamins and minerals should be added to both recommended cereal products or to the oral rehydration solution itself children who are breastfed should continue breastfeeding 20antibiotics  editwho recommends that all severely malnourished children admitted to hospital should receive broadspectrum antibiotics for example gentamicin and ampicillin  in addition hospitalized children should be checked daily for other specific infections 20if cholera is suspected give an antibiotic to which v cholera e are susceptible this reduces the volume loss due to diarrhea by 50 and shortens the duration of diarrhea to about 48 hours 39physiological basis  editintestinal epithelium he stainfluid from the body enters the intestinal lumen during digestion this fluid is isosmotic with the blood and contains a high quantity about 142 m eql of sodium a healthy individual secretes 2000–3000 milligrams of sodium per day into the intestinal lumen nearly all of this is reabsorbed so that sodium levels in the body remain constant in a diarrheal illness sodiumrich intestinal secretions are lost before they can be reabsorbed this can lead to lifethreatening dehydration or electrolyte imbalances within hours when fluid loss is severe the objective of therapy is the replenishment of sodium and water losses by ort or intravenous infusion 40sodium absorption occurs in two stages the first is via intestinal epithelial cells  enterocytes  sodium passes into these cells by cotransport with glucose via the sglt1 protein from the intestinal epithelial cells sodium is pumped by active transport via the sodiumpotassium pump through the basolateral cell membrane into the extracellular space 41 42the sodium–potassium atpase pump at the basolateral cell membrane moves three sodium ions into the extracellular space while pulling into the enterocyte two potassium ions this creates a downhill sodium gradient within the cell sglt proteins use energy from this downhill sodium gradient to transport glucose across the apical membrane of the cell against the glucose gradient the cotransporters are examples of secondary active transport the glut uniporters then transport glucose across the basolateral membrane both sglt1 and sglt2 are known as symporters since both sodium and glucose are transported in the same direction across the membrane the cotransport of glucose into epithelial cells via the sglt1 protein requires sodium two sodium ions and one molecule of glucose or galactose are transported together across the cell membrane via the sglt1 protein without glucose intestinal sodium is not absorbed this is why oral rehydration salts include both sodium and glucose for each cycle of the transport hundreds of water molecules move into the epithelial cell to maintain osmotic equilibrium the resultant absorption of sodium and water can achieve rehydration even while diarrhea continues 40history  editdefinition  editin the early 1980s oral rehydration therapy referred only to the preparation prescribed by the world health organization who and unicef in 1988 the definition changed to encompass recommended homemade solutions because the official preparation was not always readily available the definition was again amended in 1988 to include continued feeding as an appropriate associated therapy in 1991 the definition became an increase in administered hydrational fluids  and in 1993 an increase in administered fluids and continued feeding 33development  editcrane and his sketch of the sodiumglucose symporter refugee camp until 1960 ort was not known in the west dehydration was a major cause of death during the 1829 cholera pandemic in russia and western europe in 1831 william brooke oshaughnessy noted the loss of water and salt in the stool of people with cholera and prescribed intravenous fluid therapy iv fluids the prescribing of hypertonic iv therapy decreased the mortality rate of cholera from 70 to 40 percent in the west iv therapy became the gold standard for the treatment of moderate and severe dehydration 43in 1957 indian physician hemendra nath chatterjee published his results of treating people with cholera with ort 44 however he had not performed a controlled trial robert a phillips attempted to create an effective ort solution based on his discovery that in the presence of glucose sodium and chloride could be absorbed in patients with cholera however phillips efforts failed because the solution he used was excessively hypertonic 45in the early 1960s biochemist robert k crane described the sodium  glucose cotransport mechanism and its role in intestinal glucose absorption 46 this combined with evidence that the intestinal mucosa appears undamaged in cholera suggested that intestinal absorption of glucose and sodium might continue during the illness this supported the notion that oral rehydration might be possible even during severe diarrhea due to cholera in 19671968 norbert hirschhorn and nathaniel f pierce working in dhaka bangladesh and calcutta india respectively showed that people with severe cholera can absorb glucose salt and water and that this can occur in sufficient amounts to maintain hydration 47 48 in 1968 david r nalin reported that in adults with cholera given an oral glucoseelectrolyte solution in volumes equal to that of the diarrhea losses reduced the need for iv fluid therapy by eighty percent 49in 1971 fighting during the bangladesh liberation war displaced millions and an epidemic of cholera ensued among the refugees when iv fluid ran out in the refugee camps dilip mahalanabis a physician working with the johns hopkins international center for medical research and training in calcutta instructed his staff to prepare and distribute an oral rehydration solution prepared from individual ingredients to family members and caregivers over 3000 people with cholera received ort in this way the mortality rate was 36 percent among those given ort compared with 30 percent in those given iv fluid therapy 43 45in the early 1970s norbert hirschhorn used oral rehydration therapy on the white river apache indian reservation with a grant from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases 50 51 52 he made the important observation that children would voluntarily drink as much of the solution as needed to restore hydration and that rehydration and early refeeding would protect their nutrition this led to increased use of ort for children with diarrhea especially in developing countries in 1980 the bangladeshi nonprofit brac created a doortodoor and persontoperson sales force to teach ort for use by mothers at home a task force of fourteen women one cook and one male supervisor traveled from village to village after visiting with women in several villages they hit upon the idea of encouraging the women in the village to make their own oral rehydration fluid they used available household equipment starting with a half a seer half a quart of water and adding a fistful of sugar and a threefinger pinch of salt later on the approach was broadcast over television and radio and a market for oral rehydration salts packets developed three decades later national surveys have found that almost 90 of children with severe diarrhea in bangladesh are given oral rehydration fluids at home or in a health facility 53from 2006 to 2011 unicef estimated that worldwide about a third of children under 5 who had diarrhea received an oral rehydration solution with estimates ranging from 30 to 41 depending on the region 54 55ort is one of the principal elements of the unicef gobi fff program growth monitoring ort breast feeding immunization female education family spacing and food
